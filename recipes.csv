Photographs by Brittany Conerly. Published by Clarkson Potter, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC. The Bloody Mary has long been a popular morning-after drink, known for its ability to soothe symptoms of a hangover. There are just a few recipes in my collection of African American cookbooks for the classic combination, which is ordinarily made with vodka, tomato juice , Worcestershire sauce, and seasonings, but the drink is experiencing a bit of a renaissance lately. The Bottomless Bloody Mary on restaurant brunch menus, made more boldly with rum, flavored vodka, and potent spices, may be driving this trend. These Are Bartenders' Favorite Tomato Juices for Bloody Marys RELATED ARTICLE I love the flavor departure in the Bloody Maria , a fiery Mexican version built with tequila; or the complexity of iconic restaurateur-model-author-entrepreneur Barbara “B.” Smith’s Cajun Mary, which she included in B. Smith Cooks Southern-Style in 2009. Smith’s ode to Louisiana can be made sweet with Absolut Mango vodka or spicy with Absolut Pepper vodka and garnished with spicy baby okra and blue-cheese–stuffed olives. And my curiosity was definitely piqued by Pat and Gina Neely’s flavor-balancing act. The television food personalities re-imagined the morning libation with hot-pepper vodka, vegetable juice, barbecue sauce, and horseradish in their 2009 cookbook, Down Home with the Neelys: A Southern Family Cookbook . I also fell hard for the idea of Bloody Marys for a Crowd, in Elle Simone Scott’s 2022 cookbook, Boards —so hard that I included a version of the recipe in Cook’s Country magazine, where I am editor-in-chief. Elle starts by making a big batch of classic Bloodies, but for variety, she sets out a wide assortment of rim salts, skewers, and garnishes—everything from classic olives and celery to chicken wings and poached shrimp—so people can customize their drink to their heart’s content. Clarkson Potter / Brittany Conerly In the end, though, it was the Bloody Mary à la Jerk, included in Helen Willinsky’s 1990 book, Jerk Barbecue from Jamaica , that won me over. Inspired by its use of sweet-hot spices, the version that follows swaps rum for vodka and doubles easily to serve a large crowd. Rimming the outside edge of the serving glass with the jerk seasoning intensifies the island experience, but it is optional. Serves 8 to 10.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'quart', 'ingredient': 'tomato juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'prepared jerk seasoning'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'celery salt'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'worcestershire sauce'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'fresh lime or lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'hot pepper sauce, or to taste'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'light or dark rum'}, {'quantity': '8–10', 'unit': 'lime or lemon', 'ingredient': 'lime or lemon'}, {'quantity': '8–10', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'celery stalks, with leaves'}]","['Combine the tomato juice, 1 tablespoon of the jerk seasoning, the celery salt, and Worcestershire sauce in a small microwave- safe pitcher.

Photographs by Brittany Conerly. Published by Clarkson Potter, a division of Penguin Random House, LLC. The Clover Leaf is a floral, fruity, and sweet gin drink, made with grenadine (pomegranate syrup), lemon juice, and egg whites, resulting in a cocktail with the taste and mouthfeel of berry cream soda. It is sometimes confused with the Clover Club , which uses raspberry syrup in place of the grenadine and vermouth for the lemon juice. (Longtime Tulsa caterer Cleora Butler enjoyed combining grenadine and vermouth—pantry staples that are more accessible than raspberry syrup and fresh lemon juice.) Either way, the drink is sensational, and is another delicious way to serve that homemade grenadine mixed with Old Tom gin , which is mild and smooth. Clarkson Potter / Brittany Conerly If you prefer raspberry syrup to the grenadine, this updated option relies on Chambord, a luxury brand of black raspberry liqueur, to tone down some of the sugar. Pasteurized egg whites or half-and-half also replace the frothy raw egg. In either case, this technique demonstrates the high art of cocktail making, shaking to create a beautiful crown of foam.","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Chambord liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'fresh lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pasteurized egg whites'}, {'quantity': '1–1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaf'}]","['Combine the Chambord or grenadine, lemon juice, egg white or half-and-half, and gin in a cocktail shaker with ice cubes.', 'Shake vigorously for 10 seconds, until the ingredients are cold and the mix is frothy with a pink blush.', 'Strain into a Martini or coupe cocktail glass, making sure there is a thin layer of foam and a few small ice chips floating on top.', 'Garnish with the mint leaf.']",40,liqueur
https://www.liquor.com/emerson-cocktail-recipe-8572484,Emerson,Dylan Garret,"The Emerson is a classic cocktail consisting of gin, sweet vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and lime juice. It’s a close relative of the Martinez , itself considered a possible forebearer of the Martini. The exact origins of the drink are largely unknown, though some say the drink was named in honor of Ralph Waldo Emerson, and one of its earliest known appearances was in Jacques Straub’s 1913 book Straub’s Manual of Mixed Drinks . It mostly follows cocktails of the era, taking the spirit-plus-vermouth-plus-modifier template of drinks like the Manhattan and the Martini and adding its own slight tweaks. What Makes the Emerson Work Like the Martinez, the Emerson follows a structure of gin, sweet vermouth, and maraschino liqueur, but it differs in its modifier. While the Martinez uses bitters as its accent ingredient, the Emerson opts for a relatively small amount of lime juice. What this does is skews the cocktail away from the bitter and spirit-forward template of drinks and towards the sour category, though somewhat more subtly than other classic sours of the era like the Gin Sour or Daiquiri . What you get is a cocktail that straddles the line between these two worlds. 10 Cocktails to Make with Maraschino Liqueur RELATED ARTICLE At 1/4 ounce, maraschino liqueur is used in a relatively small amount here. However, it provides a substantial amount of backbone when considered as a sweetener. The grams of sugar by volume in maraschino liqueur are roughly double that of most sweet vermouths, meaning it’s easier to tweak small amounts of liqueur used in the Emerson to fit your preferred flavor profile rather than alter the volume of vermouth. Maraschino helps bring out the fruit-forward notes of vermouth and contribute sweetness while not overpowering vermouth’s more subtle qualities. In all, the Emerson is an interesting representation of two popular pre-Prohibition styles of cocktail fused together, and a fantastic option for fans of either citrus-forward sours or spirit-forward Martinez-style cocktails looking for something different.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin, preferably Old Tom'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine all ingredients except garnish in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.', 'Shake for 10–15 seconds, until well chilled.', 'Double strain through a fine mesh strainer into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a maraschino cherry.']",29,gin
https://www.liquor.com/kansas-city-ice-water-cocktail-recipe-8558889,Kansas City Ice Water,Audrey Morgan,"The Kansas City Ice Water, also known as the KC Ice Water, is a simple cocktail that usually includes gin, vodka, lime juice, triple sec, and lemon-lime soda. The drink remains popular in its original form, but that hasn’t stopped some bartenders from seeking to improve upon its base template. This zesty, floral, and crowd-pleasing riff comes from Andrew Olsen, national beverage director of J. Rieger & Co , a historic distillery in Kansas City, Missouri. “The KC Ice Water was a common order in the high-volume bar scene of many college towns and local haunts, especially in the Midwest region,” says Olsen. “In 2017, when opening up a restaurant in the Country Club Plaza district, I recognized that popularity and wanted to make something that was reminiscent of the original flavors, but with a more craft element added to it.” “Our version stays with the vodka base but instead of splitting with gin, we use riesling wine,” he says. “This gives us great minerality and some brilliant fruit flavors like pear and green apple. Then we use a chamomile syrup that is somewhat parallel to the floral/botanical experience you get from the gin.” For the base, Olsen uses J. Rieger’s Premium Wheat Vodka , which is 100% wheat-based and has a rich texture due to a final distillation in a copper pot still . If you can’t source J. Rieger, look for another wheat-based vodka. Olsen also suggests using a kabinett riesling, which is a semi-dry, high-acid style. This recipe calls for a homemade chamomile syrup, which comes together easily on the stovetop and can be saved for use in other cocktails or for cooking and baking. You can source dried chamomile flowers on Amazon or at many grocery stores like Whole Foods. The cocktail is balanced with fresh lime juice and a coarse sparkling mineral water like Topo Chico or Jarritos Mineragua.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'riesling'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'chamomile syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sparkling mineral water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'Garnish:', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel'}]","['Combine all ingredients except sparkling mineral water in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.', 'Shake for 15–20 seconds, until well chilled.', 'Pour sparkling mineral water in a highball glass, and strain the mixture from the shaker over it.

https://www.liquor.com/champs-elysees-cocktail-recipe-8558284,Champs-Élysées,Dylan Garret,"The Champs-Élysées is a classic cocktail that consists of cognac, Green Chartreuse, lemon juice, simple syrup, and bitters. Named after the famous Paris avenue, it’s essentially a riff on the Sidecar that calls for Chartreuse rather than orange liqueur. The cocktail was first popularized in Europe, as the United States was still in the midst of Prohibition. The drink began to appear in cocktail books around 1925, when it was featured in Drinks—Long and Short by Nina Toye & A. H. Adair. In 1930, its profile grew further when it was included in Harry Craddock’s The Savoy Cocktail Book , which dialed up the recipe to punch proportions, meant to serve six. Despite these early 20th-century appearances, little is known about who first formulated the Champs-Élysées cocktail. Whatever the drink’s origins, it worked to bring attention to the mixability of French herbal liqueurs. It also contributed to the development of the sour category of drinks through bartender experimentation of previous iterations like the Sidecar and its forebearer, the Brandy Crusta . How to Make a Sidecar RELATED ARTICLE What Makes the Champs-Élysées Work While the Sidecar uses orange liqueur as its sweetener, the Champs-Élysées employs Green Chartreuse, an aromatic French herbal liqueur. When it’s combined with Angostura bitters, what you get is a deeper, more earthy and woodsy cocktail in the sour profile, as opposed to the Sidecar’s juicier, fruit-forward notes. This makes the Champs-Élysées a fantastic alternative for those seeking a sour style of cocktail while minimizing the potential for it to turn into a juice bomb. Lemon juice provides the needed acidity to balance the sweet elements, but the aromatics of the other ingredients create something that may be appealing to those who usually favor more spirit-forward cocktails. The drink is sweetened with both Chartreuse and neutral simple syrup, as the former ingredient would overpower the drink. Though this recipe calls for Green Chartreuse, those who wish for a more subtle touch may opt for the milder Yellow Chartreuse , which will come across as less perfumy in the final mix and has a slightly lower alcohol content. Green Chartreuse vs. Yellow Chartreuse: The Main Differences RELATED ARTICLE Worth noting, both styles of Chartreuse can be difficult to source at times, as production of the spirits is limited, and demand can often skyrocket. While there are no direct replacements for the classic liqueur, there are many newer alternatives that can work within the below specifications for a slightly different but delicious drink.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cognac'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Green Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine all ingredients except garnish in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.', 'Shake for 15–20 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",25,
https://www.liquor.com/bushwick-cocktail-recipe-8553072,Bushwick,Dylan Garret,"The Bushwick cocktail was created in 2009 by bartender Phil Ward at Mayahuel, the bar he operated in New York City’s East Village until 2017. Named after a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, this combination of rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and Amer Picon is essentially a riff on the classic Brooklyn cocktail that opts for sweet vermouth rather than dry. The Brooklyn, which debuted in the early 1900s, is  often attributed to a bartender who sought to create a new cocktail to stand alongside the iconic Manhattan and newly ascendent Bronx cocktail. Though it fell out of fashion through most of the 20th century—at least in comparison to the Manhattan—it saw a resurgence in the 2000s as bartenders continued to revive pre-Prohibition cocktails. While the original Brooklyn was created in an effort to capitalize on the trend of cocktails named after New York City boroughs, roughly 100 years later the Bushwick represented a new trend of bartenders naming cocktails after specific neighborhoods within those boroughs, like the Greenpoint , Red Hook , and Bay Ridge . Ironically, according to research by drinks historian David Wondrich in The Daily Beast , early Brooklyn recipes actually called for sweet vermouth, before later printings of the recipes in various cocktail menus began to make the switch to dry. Essentially, Ward’s Bushwick cocktail could be seen as a Brooklyn made to its original specifications. How to Make a Brooklyn RELATED ARTICLE What’s In a Bushwick? Ward’s original recipe called for a base of Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey, a 100-proof bottling that delivers a punchy 50% ABV. The drink also included Carpano Antica Formula, a notably rich sweet vermouth, and Luxardo maraschino liqueur . These ingredients make for a bolder style of cocktail, in which flavor-forward ingredients work to keep each other in check. However, when making one, feel free to play with various brands and expressions of rye and sweet vermouth to find the balance that works best for your tastes. The final ingredient is the trickiest for most to source—Amer Picon, a French aperitif flavored with bitter oranges and gentian. Unfortunately, the ingredient is famously unavailable to purchase in the United States, as one of its ingredients, calamus root, runs afoul of a mid-20th century Food and Drug Administration regulation still on the books. If you’re unable to source a bottle of Amer Picon, Ward has recommended swapping the ingredient with the more readily available Amaro Lucano . Other fans of the drink recommend Amaro CioCiaro as a suitable substitute as well.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Amer Picon'}]","['Combine all ingredients in a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir for 15–20 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass without garnish.']",17,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/lychee-rose-cocktail-recipe-8551798,Lychee Rosé,Prairie Rose,"The Lychee Rosé is one of the few cocktails featured on Spago Beverly Hills’ Rare & Extravagant menu. It is also now Taylor Swift-approved . The mastermind behind the drink is bar director Adam George Fournier, formerly a Diageo World Class U.S. Bartender of the Year. Hired at the beginning of 2023 as the restaurant’s first dedicated bar director since the legendary Los Angeles restaurant opened in 1982, Fournier says that the Rare & Extravagant section on the revamped menu is a way for Spago “to highlight rare, unique, or luxury spirits.” The Lychee Rosé “was designed around Tequila Komos Reposado Rosa, a tequila aged in French oak ex-red wine barrels, [giving] it a unique flavor profile [and color],” says Fournier. “Essentially it’s our answer to a Lychee Martini.” We’re Drinking Like It’s 1999. Here’s How Cocktails Became Fun Again. RELATED ARTICLE The drink combines the rose-hued tequila with salted lychee cordial, manzanilla sherry, St-Germain elderflower liqueur , and fresh lime juice for a balance of perfumed fruit, tart citrus, and a touch of saline. At Spago, the cocktail is served in a glass shaped like a rose and garnished with a few delicate flower petals. At home, a chilled cocktail coupe will suffice.

https://www.liquor.com/cadillac-margarita-cocktail-recipe-8425804,Cadillac Margarita (El Cadí),Audrey Morgan,"There’s no one specific recipe for the Cadillac Margarita, and it might mean something different to whomever you ask. For Karla Flores-Mercado, proprietor of Bar Flores and other establishments in Los Angeles, it brings to mind Southern California’s old-school Mexican restaurants like Acapulco , where she bartended early in her career, serving Cadillac Margaritas with a shot of Grand Marnier for customers to pour over the drink. At Bar Flores, Flores-Mercado created the El Cadí in homage to restaurants that include Acapulco and El Compadre , home of the Flaming Margarita. In lieu of sour mix, Flores-Mercado’s version includes fresh lemon and lime juices for tartness, along with an earthy highlands tequila, agave syrup, and a Mexican orange liqueur. Finally, she tops the drink with a Grand Marnier float as a nod to the Acapulco Cadillac. “The Grand Marnier gives it a different vibe from just whipping up a sour,” says Flores-Mercado. “You get a little more booze but there’s also added sweetness, so it makes the Margarita a little easier to drink for some people.” For the tequila base, Flores-Mercado opts for El Tesoro Blanco , a benchmark highlands-style tequila with a rich mouthfeel and long spicy finish. “The earthiness really comes through in Margaritas,” she says. Since the bar program places an emphasis on sourcing Mexican spirits, Flores-Mercado uses Naranja Licor de Naranja , which she says is less sweet and more citrus-forward than other orange liqueurs. She also splits the sour component between lemon and lime juice, making for a slightly tarter drink that helps to balance the added sweetness from Grand Marnier. What Is a Cadillac Margarita? Again, there’s not one spec, but the Cadillac is generally a richer, more opulent version of the classic Margarita (blanco tequila and lime juice, sweetened with orange liqueur and/or agave syrup). A quick online search might yield recipes that call for lightly aged reposado tequila instead of the usual blanco, or the cognac-based orange liqueur Grand Marnier either swapped in for other triple secs or added to the drink as a float. Some Cadillacs are simply differentiated by the brand of tequila used, which is why you’ll often see somewhat meaningless terms like “premium” and “top shelf.” The origins of the Cadillac Margarita are murky, but it was popularized in the 1980s and ‘90s as chain restaurants began adding Cadillacs to their menus with substitutions like higher-end tequilas and the aforementioned Grand Marnier.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'El Tesoro Blanco Tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Naranja Licor de Naranja'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Grand Marnier, to float'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rub the rim of a double Old Fashioned glass with a lime wedge, and dip a quarter of the glass in salt to coat.

https://www.liquor.com/miladys-martini-cocktail-recipe-8418918,Milady’s Martini,Audrey Morgan,"This unique Martini recipe comes from our 2023 Liquor Legend Julie Reiner . With a career that spans nearly three decades, Reiner has shaped modern cocktail culture, past and present, at New York City bars that include Flatiron Lounge, Pegu Club, Clover Club, Leyenda, and most recently, Milady’s , a finalist for our Best New Bar of the year. “It’s always been a classic, but the Martini is having a moment right now,” says Reiner. “The Milady’s Martini is my take on the original and one of my favorites that we serve. We use gin, rosé vermouth, fino sherry, and Amaro Santoni, so it has a slight pink hue that we pair with a purple olive garnish. We serve it as a ‘cheeky’ size which is just a three-ounce pour [with sidecar], making this a great one to sip if you want to have multiple drinks without overindulging.” Julie Reiner Is Our 2023 Liquor Legend RELATED ARTICLE The drink is similar to Milady’s itself—a reimagined version of a classic. The original Milady’s, an old-school haunt in New York City’s Soho neighborhood, dated by some accounts to the 1940s but closed its doors in 2014. Reiner and partners Christine Williams and Susan Fedroff reopened the space in 2022, paying homage to its roots with a laid back ambience while introducing the well-crafted cocktails that Reiner has honed over her years in the industry. The Milady’s Martini is essentially a Martini made in the 50/50 style, with a split modifier of rosé vermouth and fino sherry. While some Martini recipes call for orange bitters, the Milady’s Martini includes a small amount of amaro. Reiner also opts for the freezer method of preparation, which is a great way to batch Martinis and other spirit-forward drinks for a crowd. Since this drink only features a few ingredients, it’s worth sourcing the intended bottles, although any London dry style of gin will work. Tio Pepe is a very dry fino-style sherry with notes of almonds and green apples, while Lustau’s rosé vermouth is made with a fino sherry base and shows a beautiful floral aroma. Amaro Santoni is bittersweet and complex, with prominent notes of Chinese rhubarb, sour orange, and baking spices. Feel free to serve a “cheeky” three-ounce version in a Nick & Nora glass, or simply sip it all at once.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Fords Gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lustau rosé vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Tio Pepe sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Amaro Santoni'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'purple olive', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon peel, expressed and discarded', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel, expressed and discarded', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine all ingredients except garnishes in a small, 4–6 ounce sealable bottle or a small covered carafe.

https://www.liquor.com/ramos-melon-fizz-cocktail-recipe-8416904,Ramos Melon Fizz,Audrey Morgan,"This fragrant take on the Ramos Gin Fizz comes from The Fox Bar in Nashville and includes toasted rice-washed gin and Midori. When writer Caroline Hatchett asked bartenders to share their favorite “uncool” spirits for a story , Fox Bar owner Laura Unterberg chose Midori, the melon-flavored, day-glo green liqueur most famously used in the Midori Sour . “We reach for Midori frequently as a modifier at The Fox Bar,” says Unterberg. “It’s easily one of the best-executed melon spirits on the market, and plays nicely with bright acidic sours, fern bar-era cocktails, and even adds a nice balance to the savory, leathery notes in mezcal and sotol.” Bartenders Share Their Favorite “Uncool” Spirits—and How to Use Them FEATURED IN This recipe is a riff on the Ramos Gin Fizz , a drink that relies on an infamously long shake time to emulsify all of the ingredients. “Midori adds a floral, summery backdrop to this lightly green take on the classic,” says Unterberg. This drink’s other main differentiator is toasted rice gin. The Fox Bar uses Wonderbird Gin No. 61 , which is made with fermented jasmine rice from the Mississippi Delta, then amps up the flavor profile by washing the spirit with toasted jasmine rice. To re-create at home, you’ll need a sous-vide machine or immersion circulator . You can skip this step, but what you’ll get is essentially a Ramos Gin Fizz with a splash of Midori (which will still be delicious). While a typical Ramos Gin Fizz calls for lemon and lime juices, The Fox Bar uses a lime stock recipe from Trash Collective , employing leftover lime husks gifted from a neighboring business, to reduce waste. Though optional for this recipe, citrus stock involves a simple 30-minute process of pressure-cooking spent citrus husks (pulp and all) in water, then straining and adjusting with acid and sugar to create a liquid that can act as a juice substitute or volume enhancer. “While you’re more than welcome to use fresh juice in this recipe, clarified lime will behave a little bit closer to stock,” says Unterberg. Finally, a dusting of imperial-grade matcha adds earthy notes that temper the cocktail’s sweetness, and plays nicely off the toasted rice gin.","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '1', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime stock'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rich simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Midori'}, {'quantity': '1 3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rice-washed Wonderbird Gin No. 61'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Soda water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Imperial-grade matcha', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a cocktail shaker, add all ingredients except the soda water.

https://www.liquor.com/a-little-chili-punch-recipe-platypus-8414536,A Little Chili Punch,Dylan Garret,"At Platypus, our Best Under-the-Radar Bar of 2023 , no ingredient goes unused. As the owners of a bar that launched during a period of pandemic-related uncertainty and snarled supply chains, Tony Saputo and Meredith Barry worked to ensure that liquor stocks were kept as tight as possible. They also introduced a perpetually rotating drinks menu that changed to reflect what ingredients they had on hand. This drink, A Little Chili Punch, is a tropical clarified milk punch that incorporates spices, pepper, and citrus to embody the bar’s ethos of innovation and scrappiness. “Not only does the drink look freakin’ awesome, but it really shines in what we do here,” says Saputo. “While we’re making original concoctions every week, and average about 250 new menu items a year, it’s hard to pick one type of drink that really showcases our skills and talents.” Liquor Awards: The Best of 2023 FEATURED IN A Little Chili Punch came about when the staff at Platypus was seeking a way to use a large quantity of jalapeño vodka in a large-batch cocktail, taking the base ingredient then adding layer after layer of complementary flavors to the final drink. “We organize events with multiple suppliers and sometimes this paints us into a corner that makes us think a little outside the box,” says Saputo. “This was one of those cases where we used Lifted Spirit’s Jalapeno and Herb Vodka to concoct a drink that not only played to the capsaicin qualities of jalapeño but showed the sweet and savory side of the pepper meat. This also let us lean into a tropical variety of flavors while using the astringency of the bourbon and tea to make a well balanced and delightful drink.” Saputo notes that making the drink is a long process, requiring around a week of total prep time to allow the flavors to fully integrate and the milk punch to clarify. However, the day-to-day upkeep is minimal, and mostly just involves adding a handful of ingredients each day, then being patient while waiting on the results. This recipe yields just under a gallon of punch, and will keep refrigerated for months. It’s a fantastic option for your next large gathering, or just to prepare ahead of time and have on hand throughout the season.","[{'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'Peels of', 'ingredient': 'whole lemons'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'Peels of', 'ingredient': 'orange'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'Peels of', 'ingredient': 'whole grapefruits'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '1', 'ingredient': 'pineapple, diced with skins'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pound', 'ingredient': 'granulated sugar'}, {'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg, freshly grated'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'coriander seeds'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pod', 'ingredient': 'star anise'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'pods', 'ingredient': 'green cardamom, roasted'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'allspice berries, whole'}, {'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'cloves, whole'}, {'quantity': '16', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Lifted Spirits Jalapeño and Herb Vodka'}, {'quantity': '16', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cleveland Wheat Penny 1958 Bourbon'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Heirloom Pineapple Amaro'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Geijer California Fernet'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pastis'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'quart', 'ingredient': 'oversteeped passion fruit green tea (instructions below)'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'quarts', 'ingredient': 'whole milk'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sweet pepper (optional)', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'carnation flower (optional)', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['1st Day Combine all citrus peels, pineapple, and sugar in a large container.

This means eschewing ingredients introduced to North America by European settlers, including cane sugar, wheat flour, and dairy. While the restaurant offers beer and wine options that focus on BIPOC producers, its cocktail list is completely non-alcoholic. So, what does it mean to create a bar program that doesn’t utilize spirits, citrus, sugar, or any of the ingredients commonly associated with mixed drinks? “I like to make sure that each drink is not just something that is delicious to consume but that it’s providing something for the body as well,” says Jasmine Teague, bartender at Owamni. Liquor Awards: The Best of 2023 FEATURED IN Dagwaagin is a non-alcoholic fall squash shrub that’s become one of the restaurant’s most popular offerings. Apple cider vinegar  provides acidity and backbone in place of a more traditional alcoholic spirit, while maple syrup provides sweetness and ginger brings added heat and a spicy depth. The drink is served with a splash of soda water and mint to create an aromatic but easy-sipping spritz that utilizes all natively produced ingredients. Fall squash can include a wide range of vegetables. Common varieties include spaghetti squash, butternut squash, and pumpkin, which tend to offer sweeter, more mild flavors. Earthier squash like acorn, delicata, or kabocha can be substituted as well, though these may require more maple or mint to balance the drink to taste. Squash can be peeled and shredded with a food processor, or prepared manually with a box grater. Thinner-skinned squash like delicata can be processed with the skin on. This recipe creates a large-batch fall shrub that yields about 2 gallons. You can scale the recipe down for smaller batches by reducing the ingredients evenly.

https://www.liquor.com/terroir-old-fashioned-cocktail-recipe-8407345,Terroir Old Fashioned,Dylan Garret,"Terroir is the sense of place that regional ingredients impart to food or drink based on where they were grown. Though popularized in the wine industry, the concept has increasingly been used to describe aspects of any regionally specific agriculture-based product, from tequila to honey. This cocktail from Overstory in New York City, our Best Craft Cocktail Bar of 2023 , was created by bar director Harrison Ginsberg. “It’s an Old Fashioned-style cocktail that is represented through terroir,” he says. “Every single ingredient in the drink comes from a very specific place.” The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN The base is reposado tequila infused with toasted palo santo, an aromatic hardwood native to parts of Central and South America. Agave nectar is caramelized to increase its depth of profile, while vin jaune, an oxidative style of wine from Jura, France (where it translates to “yellow wine”) adds nutty notes akin to those of a dry sherry. Yellow Chartreuse lends its signature herbal characteristics. Though tequila is the base spirit, the cocktail has a deep whiskey-like quality from the caramelized agave syrup that Ginsburg says result in a “Mounds Bar-like flavor.” To tie the drink to the terroir of the bar’s home city, Tilden sea salt, harvested from nearby Fort Tilden in the borough of Queens, New York, is added alongside housemade honeycomb. “The honeycomb has the nooks and crannies and webbing that the agave piña has, and also that honey-caramel note to it,” says Ginsberg. Though certain elements of the drink, such as the palo santo and housemade honeycomb, are tough to replicate, Overstory offered this take on the cocktail for those who wish to recreate some of the terroir of its signature Old Fashioned riff at home.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'Yellow Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave caramel'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': '3/4', 'ingredient': 'vin jaune'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'reposado tequila'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'honeycomb', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients except garnish into a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir for 15–20 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over a fresh, extra-large ice cube.', 'Express a lemon twist over the drink then discard.', 'Garnish with honeycomb, if desired.']",9,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/la-botana-cocktail-recipe-8412186,La Botana,Dylan Garret,"Created by bartender Enrique Sanchez, La Botana comes from ABV in San Francisco, Liquor.com’s Best Neighborhood Bar of 2023 . It’s essentially a beer cocktail that utilizes a range of ingredients such as mezcal, orange juice, lime, habanero bitters, and house pickling liquid to create a flavor profile that’s emblematic of the bar’s approach. “We chose [to showcase] this drink since we’re known for our mezcal selection,” says Ryan Fitzgerald, manager partner of ABV. “It reads funky and scares a lot of people, but once they order it, they love it.” The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN ABV was founded in 2014 by a trio of hospitality veterans—Fitzgerald, Todd Smith, and Erik Reichborn-Kjennerud—who sought to create a more accessible space after years spent in more formal, speakeasy-style cocktail bars. La Botana features a pair of ingredients made custom at ABV: the bar’s house habanero bitters and a house pickling liquid. “The pickling liquid comes from the pickles that we make for the burger,” says Fitzgerald. “But instead of tasting like pickles, it tastes more like a really fresh cucumber shrub. That reminds us of the ‘botanas’ that are often served at restaurants in Mexico—slices of orange, cucumber, and jicama with spicy Tajín and lime juice.” While you’ll need to take a trip to ABV to try the original, authentic version of this cocktail, you can swap in a few substitutes to create a homemade La Botana. Brands like Bittermens now offer habanero bitters as part of their selection, and jarred pickle brine can stand in for ABV’s housemade version if you’re not up for making a cucumber shrub from scratch.

It’s an approachable cocktail that’s easy to make but still expresses a wealth of flavor. “I love a Whiskey Sour, and always have,” says Jeff Morgenthaler, bartender and co-owner of Pacific Standard. “We touched it up with a dollop of egg white and a touch of apricot liqueur because stone fruits go so well with bourbon, especially Evan Williams bonded.” The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN The drink calls for rich simple syrup, which ups the ratio of sugar to water to 2:1, allowing the sweetness to come through without thinning out the drink. Combined with egg white, the rich simple syrup creates a rounder mouthfeel while still allowing the overproof base liquor to shine. All in all, it’s an accessible version of a classic drink, and embodies the style that Pacific Standard has become known for since opening in 2022. “It’s a failure of a bar when everyone is sitting around smelling their drinks and taking pictures of them,” says Morgenthaler. “I don’t need people thinking about the drinks, I need them enjoying them.”","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bonded bourbon, preferably Evan Williams Bottled-in-Bond'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rich simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'apricot brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}]","['Add all ingredients to cocktail shaker without ice.', 'Dry shake for 15–20 seconds until egg is thoroughly whipped.', 'Add ice and shake again for 10–15 seconds to chill.', 'Shake and strain into an Irish Coffee glass, and serve without garnish.']",18,bourbon

It’s a seemingly simple drink that consists of vodka, lemon juice, ginger tea, and a lavender and dry spice syrup, but behind these four ingredients, an array of subtle touches and preparation tweaks make the drink more than a sum of its parts. An approachable, refreshing crowd pleaser that offers a complex profile with layers of flavor, the drink mirrors La Factoría itself—our top honoree in the Expertise In Hospitality category of our 2023 Liquor Awards. The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN La Factoría founder and partner Leslie Cofresi describes the bar’s approach to cocktails as classics “with a little twist, to give a surprise.” It’s on display here, where a simple spin on a Moscow Mule incorporates a housemade lavender syrup enriched with toasted spices, and freshly made ginger tea adds heat while complementing the drink’s aromatic profile. Cofresi says the Lavender Mule itself came about by accident. “I was making Moscow Mules and [another] signature cocktail that used the lavender and dry spice infusion,” he says. “When we started running low on ingredients, I started mixing the ginger and the lavender and people went crazy over it. The drink is so simple and refreshing [that] it just caught on.” It has since become one of the bar’s most popular creations, and Cofresi says La Factoría now sells thousands of Lavender Mules each month. The public reaction to the drink has spread to other bars, where it’s now common to see lavender-themed creations that aim to capture some of the magic of the original drink. Though the ginger tea and the lavender syrup take a bit of extra prep time, both are fairly simple to make and can be easily put together in a home kitchen.

It’s earned accolades from the international drinks community and local fans alike, and was recently voted winner of our Global Spotlight category in the 2023 Liquor Awards. The Petronio showcases Alquímico’s unique approach to cocktails and how owner Jean Trinh and his team are utilizing regional ingredients to create innovative flavor profiles. The drink, which was named after the popular music festival Petronio Álvarez, features a base of reposado tequila, which has barrel-aged notes of vanilla that are accentuated by the addition of vanilla liqueur. Freshly squeezed lemon juice and orange juice bring in familiar citrus elements of other tequila-based sours, but a few other ingredients make this drink one of a kind. The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN Puré de lulo, or lulo puree, comes from a fruit typical to the region. It’s not as widely incorporated into drinks elsewhere, as the fruit’s delicateness makes it difficult to transport abroad. Outwardly it may initially appear as an orange, or orange-hued persimmon, but the green pulp within provides tart flavor that may strike some as a tangy cross between citrus, kiwi, pineapple, or something that’s just uniquely lulo. The cocktail’s other addition, viche, is a traditional homebrewed spirit made from sugar cane, primarily crafted by Afro-Colombian women from the country’s Pacific coast. Though the spirit was outlawed through much of Colombia’s recent history, a 2019 ruling that offered protection for ancestral Indigenous beverages was later expanded to those of Afro-Colombian heritage, legalizing the drink and giving it a new place on menus like Alquímico’s. Though some of these ingredients may prove more difficult to source for those outside their country of origin, specialty online retailers may be able to help.

There, head partner and bartender Chris Hannah pays tribute to the city’s history through the bar program’s drinks, which feature numerous innovative riffs of classic Crescent City cocktails. “The Night Tripper was named for one of our local heroes, Dr. John,” says Hannah. “Amazing New Orleans piano player. What it says about our team, and Jewel, is how we love our city and draw inspiration from our local culture.” The Liquor Awards: Best of 2023 FEATURED IN The Night Tripper leans into the traditional spirit, sweet, and bitter profile of many classic aromatic cocktails. Hannah uses a bottled-in-bond bourbon as the base and adds two amari, Averna and Ramazzotti, though you can use any dark amaro of your choice. Peychaud’s bitters, invented in New Orleans by apothecary Antoine Amédée Peychaud in the mid-1800s, help bring depth and spice to the drink without clashing with the unique bitter profile of the amaro. Notably, the herbal liqueur Strega acts as a sweetening element, adding an extra dose of mint, anise, and fennel to the mix. Combined, just four simple ingredients create a flavorful drink that’s more than the sum of its parts. Fans of other spirit-forward New Orleans cocktails like the Sazerac or Vieux Carré will find familiar comfort here, but the Night Tripper’s profile is complex enough to stand on its own in the canon of modern classics.

https://www.liquor.com/boothby-cocktail-recipe-8403580,Boothby,Dylan Garret,"The Boothby is a pre-Prohibition cocktail that features rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, two types of bitters, and Champagne. It’s essentially just a Manhattan with the addition of sparkling wine. The drink is thought to have been created around 1910 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, and takes the name of its creator, William “Cocktail” Boothby, a prominent Bay Area bartender of the era. Boothy himself was an interesting character, who fell into bartending after stints bouncing around various odd jobs. Before launching his bar career, Boothby is stated to have worked as a vaudeville minstrel, a real estate agent, medical salesperson, and tailor, among other hustles. After transitioning to bartending in the late 1800s, Boothby even organized a coalition of fellow bar workers to get himself nominated and elected to the California State Assembly in 1895, after which he began to refer to himself as The Honorable William T. Boothby. The Origins of the Boothby The Boothby cocktail itself isn’t anything particularly special but is notable for its place in San Francisco cocktail culture, and William Boothby’s impact on bartending. His 1891 book, Cocktail Boothby’s American Bar-Tender , was one of the first of its type published on the West Coast, and offered instructions on a number of classics, as well as Boothby originals. His book wasn’t too dissimilar from those circulating around the East Coast of the U.S. at the time. In fact, Boothby hadn’t been tending bar for all that long before releasing his manual, which the cover states to be “endorsed by all clubmen and mixologists” and “sold by all newsdealers throughout the English speaking world.” It’s written in a rather casual manner, and includes standard recipes in addition to  sections that seem geared specifically for the trade. 15 Cocktails to Make If You Love Manhattans RELATED ARTICLE One section titled “Valuable Secrets for Liquor Dealers” gives some rather dubious tips, such as advising readers to fake longer-aged whiskey by adding prune juice to the barrel, or to approximate bourbon by adding various oils, ether, and wine vinegar to a proof spirit before coloring it with burnt sugar. A few pages later, a recipe for “Cheap Beer” instructs DIY brewers to use a combination of green pea shells and wood sage in place of hops. Other tips are much more functional, like “Do not serve a frosted glass to a gentleman who wears a moustache, as the sugar adheres to that appendage and causes great inconvenience.” Whatever your opinion of some of  Boothby’s more specific methods, he was a bartender’s bartender, whose advice seems to be particularly positioned towards industry brethren. He credited those who created recipes which were not his own, and his original cocktails, the namesake Boothby included, are mainly  classics with minor alterations. And, if you think about it, his techniques of fortifying spirits with prune juice, aromatic oils and vinegar aren’t too far removed from the “house infusions” of today’s bartenders. (If it helps with his street cred, he was also arrested in 1922 for violating the Volstead Act and serving alcohol during Prohibition.) The Boothby cocktail itself faithfully follows the classic Manhattan recipe, with the simple addition of one ounce of brut Champagne at the end. The sparkling wine adds a touch of effervescence to a familiar flavor profile, slightly lightening the drink, while the bubbles help to keep the palate fresh and unfatigued.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'brut Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'Garnish:', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry'}]","['Add all ingredients except champagne and garnish to a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir for 15–20 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into chilled coupe glass, and top with champagne.', 'Garnish with a maraschino cherry.']",15,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/manhattan-transfer-cocktail-recipe-8401648,Manhattan Transfer,Dylan Garret,"The Manhattan Transfer is a modern classic cocktail composed of rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Ramazzotti amaro, and orange bitters. It was created by pioneering bartender Phil Ward at New York City’s Death & Co in 2008, making it one of the early cocktails to be featured at the famed bar. It later appeared in the bar’s influential cocktail book Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails (Ten Speed Press, 2014). The drink could be seen as a variation on a Dry Manhattan, though the combination of whiskey, dry vermouth, and bitter amaro could also be viewed as a modified version of the Old Pal . The Old Pal, which follows a similar template but opts for its bitter amaro in the form of Campari, is just a modified version of a Boulevardier , which itself is simply a whiskey Negroni . This is all to say… cocktail names are funny. But the Manhattan Transfer falls squarely in the middle of a range of classic drinks and shows how easily you can play Six Degrees of Cocktails to quickly get from a classic Manhattan to a Negroni. 15 Cocktails to Make If You Love Manhattans RELATED ARTICLE Why the Manhattan Transfer Works The primary sugar in a Manhattan Transfer comes from Ramazzotti, a dark Italian amaro that delivers notes of licorice and citrus and a strong herbal profile to the drink. The added bitterness that comes from the amaro balances the sugar in the drink, which is technically higher than the total amount of sugar in a standard Manhattan . However, stronger aromatics create a distinctly bittersweet profile, and the drink is a good example of why sugar content and a drink’s perceptible sweetness are not always completely aligned. In contrast to a drink like the Old Pal (or any Negroni variation) that uses an even sweeter red bitter liqueur, like Campari, the Manhattan Transfer will present as a relatively dry cocktail. This dryness is accentuated by the use of a 100 proof rye whiskey (Ward’s original recipe calls Rittenhouse 100, an overproof bar standard), though the volume of whiskey is dialed down by 25% from a standard Manhattan to compensate for the boozier profile. Effectively, the total ABV of the Manhattan Transfer comes in at around the same as a traditional Manhattan, but the drink will still appeal to those who like a more heavily aromatic drink with a spicier, herbal profile thanks to its playful use of ingredients. While the original Death & Co version of the Manhattan Transfer does not come with a garnish, we've included an orange twist here to help accentuate the citrus aromas of both the Ramazzotti and orange bitters. Feel free to omit if preferred.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': '100 proof rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ramazzotti'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir for 15–20 seconds, until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass, and garnish with an orange twist, if desired.']",16,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/bay-ridge-cocktail-recipe-8399143,Bay Ridge,Dylan Garret,"The Bay Ridge is a combination of rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Benedictine, prune brandy, and bitters. It can be considered a Manhattan derivative, both in composition and name. The drink originated around 2014 with Tom Macy , co-owner of iconic cocktail bar Clover Club in Brooklyn, New York, as part of a tongue-in-cheek revival of cocktails named after New York City neighborhoods. Since the early (and enduring) success of the Manhattan cocktail, other classics that took their names from New York boroughs, like the Brooklyn and the Bronx , began to pop up around the turn of the 20th century. Over a hundred years later, as modern bartenders began to revive forgotten classics, a new era of New York-themed cocktails began to spread to cocktail menus around the city, further subdivided into neighborhoods like the Greenpoint , Redhook , or, in this case, Bay Ridge. Most tend to be based around spirit-forward profiles, akin to the original Manhattan, though with certain twists. Why the Bay Ridge Works The Bay Ridge follows the whiskey-vermouth-bitters template of its predecessors, though with a few notable tweaks. While the Manhattan uses sweet vermouth to provide all the cocktail’s sugar, the Bay Ridge opts for dry vermouth, supported by Benedictine, an herbal liqueur, and prune brandy. 15 Cocktails to Make If You Love Manhattans RELATED ARTICLE The prune brandy is likely the hardest ingredient to source here, though also the one that most sets the Bay Ridge apart from similar cocktails. Macy opts for Louis Roque La Vieille Prune Plum Brandy in his recipe—distilled from three varieties of plums from the Armagnac region in the southwest of France, it’s then aged for 4–5 years in oak casks. This provides the cocktail backbone of plum, raisin, and baking spices that can be hard to replicate with other ingredients. If you’re unable to find prune brandy, an option may be to substitute a more accessible peach brandy to retain some of the intended stone fruit profile. Conversely, if you’re feeling open to experimentation and slightly lower proof, sherry can also help to recreate some of the brandy’s prune-forward profile—if you’re attempting this route, aim for a dry amontillado sherry which can help to create some of the brandy’s oxidative notes, without upsetting the cocktail’s sugar balance. However, if you’re aiming to recreate Macy’s recipe at home, sourcing prune brandy is the only way to go. Otherwise, you’ll just have to make the trip out to Clover Club to try the original for yourself.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'prune brandy'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitter'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine all ingredients except garnish in a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir for 15–20 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass, and garnish with an orange twist.']",11,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/horsefeather-cocktail-recipe-8387343,Horsefeather,Dylan Garret,"The Horsefeather is a combination of rye whiskey, ginger beer, bitters, and lemon. The de facto cocktail of Kansas City, Missouri, the drink is thought to have either originated there or in nearby Lawrence, Kansas (though exact origins are murky). As a member of the Buck family of drinks, or those that include ginger beer or ginger ale mixed with citrus and a spirit, the Horsefeather’s most popular relative would be the Moscow Mule . However, going by the name, the drink is more likely a derivative of the Horse’s Neck , which typically uses a bourbon base and ginger ale rather than the Horsefeather’s more strongly flavored ginger beer. It also shares relation to the Kentucky Buck , though that variation opts for lime over lemon, but at this point we’re basically just splitting, well, feathers. Why the Horsefeather Works Though ginger beer can come in a variety of profiles, quality options are often known for their spiciness and the heat that fresh ginger brings. A squeeze of citrus is a common pairing, as the acid from the fruit helps to cut the spice. How to Make Ginger Beer at Home RELATED ARTICLE The Horsefeather can be made with any type of whiskey. Rye whiskey’s relatively spicier and drier profile allows it to play off the heat of the ginger beer while integrating and absorbing its sugar. Bourbon will create a slightly sweeter tasting profile. For arguably the most authentic option, J. Rieger’s Kansas City Whiskey is a mainstay that combines both straight rye and straight bourbon whiskey, along with a small amount of oloroso sherry. The addition of sherry is a throwback to a common 19th century U.S. distilling practice, when tax laws forced many producers to bottle whiskeys young, and additives like sherry were often used to round out harsh flavors. Though this practice was often used to cover up the flaws of rushed production, it’s finding a new life in quality modern spirits that seek to recreate some of the unique elements of classic American whiskeys. The notable tweak that separates a Horsefeather from some of its common Buck-family siblings is the addition of Angostura bitters. This adds depth and a bit of tannic backbone to the drink, effectively making it a Mule for those who prefer a drier style of whiskey and ginger drink.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'wedge', 'ingredient': 'lemon'}]","['Add whiskey, ginger beer, and bitters to a Collins or highball glass filled with ice.', 'Squeeze lemon wedge over the drink, and add the wedge husk to the glass.', 'Stir gently to combine.']",41,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/fanciulli-cocktail-recipe-8385983,Fanciulli,Dylan Garret,"The Fanciulli is a combination of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Fernet-Branca. The cocktail is thought to date to around 1910, and is essentially a riff on the Manhattan , a popular cocktail of the era (or any era, really). While the cocktail’s name translates to an Italian slang word for “boys,” the drink is believed to be named after Francesco Fanciulli, a director for the United States Marine Band from 1892 to 1897, who succeeded John Philip Sousa. According to drinks historian Philip Greene , the trademark and internet counsel for the United States Marine Corps and founder of the Museum of the American Cocktail, Fanciulli refused a request by a superior to play a Sousa march during an 1897 parade. Fanciulli was placed under house arrest for “failure to obey a lawful order, use of disrespectful language toward an officer, and conduct being prejudiced to the conduct of good order and discipline.” 15 Cocktails to Make If You Love Manhattans RELATED ARTICLE Fanciulli eventually had his sentence mitigated by President Theodore Roosevelt, though his time with the Marine Band had reached an end. However, his legacy now lives on through both his music and the cocktail that bears his name. Why the Fanciulli Works As a fairly straightforward Manhattan variation, the Fanciulli adheres to the classic spirit-sweet-bitter ingredient combination. The primary difference between the Fanciulli and a Manhattan is its bitter component—rather than using the Manhattan’s bitters, the drink instead uses a quarter-ounce of Fernet-Branca, a menthol-forward Italian amaro . This creates a stronger aroma on the nose than your typical Manhattan, as well as a cooling effect when sipped. A seemingly small change, it completely alters the profile of the drink and makes the Fanciulli a rather unique cocktail. The 10 Best Cocktails to Make with Fernet-Branca RELATED ARTICLE The cocktail can be made with rye or bourbon. As with most spirit-forward cocktails, bourbon will generally present a sweeter-seeming profile, while rye brings spicier and more pepper-forward notes. Either style of whiskey can be used based on preference. However, there’s a slightly smaller ratio of sweet vermouth here than in a traditional Manhattan since the drink  is bolstered instead with fernet, which contains less sugar by volume. As such, bourbon’s sweetness can help to create balance and bring roundness to the cocktail, smoothing out the minty amaro’s more abrasive edges. Rye whiskey, on the other hand, will generally create a drier-tasting drink. Over a hundred years since it was first created, the Fanciulli remains a particularly well-balanced drink, and a fantastic way to mix Fernet-Branca into a cocktail .","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon or rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fernet-Branca'}]","['Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir smoothly for 15–20 seconds, until well chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.']",17,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/scotch-sour-cocktail-recipe-8384596,Scotch Sour,Dylan Garret,"The Scotch Sour is a classic cocktail made with a combination of Scotch whisky, lemon juice, sugar, egg white, and sometimes bitters. It’s simply a spirit-specific version of the Whiskey Sour , a cocktail that can be made with any type of whiskey, but modern iterations at bars in the United States tend to employ bourbon unless specified otherwise. Though the change seems minor, the vast difference in flavor profiles between scotch and other forms of whisk(e)y creates an entirely different cocktail. History of the Scotch Sour The Sour category of cocktails is one of the oldest around, and typically involves a base spirit mixed with some form of tart citrus (usually lemon or lime juice) and a sweetening agent (like sugar, syrup, or liqueur) to create balance. The term itself can be preceded by any spirit type, and drinks like the Gin Sour and Brandy Sour have been enjoyed for over a century, though their popularity has generally been eclipsed by that of the Whiskey Sour. While domestically produced whiskeys created with corn, rye, and wheat dominated the U.S. market prior to the 1900s, Prohibition’s ban on alcohol created an additional demand for Scotch whisky. Though it was smuggled into the country illicitly during this period (generally through the Bahamas, which was a British colony at the time), scotch’s foothold in America lasted far beyond Prohibition’s repeal, and only grew as exports of the spirit increased after World War II. The Complete Guide to Scotch Whisky RELATED ARTICLE An outsized number of Whiskey Sours mixed in the latter half of the 20th century may have been made with scotch, but a glut in the whisky’s production (alongside a large number of scotch imitations) met a degradation of the cocktail itself, when pre-made “sour mix” increasingly took the place of fresh ingredients. What was once one of the oldest styles of cocktail often became a slug of scotch-flavored spirit combined with a three-second push of the “sour” button on a soda gun. As the millennium turned, U.S. whiskey production exploded, as did the resurgence of classic-style cocktails using their original ingredients. The Whiskey Sour became respectable again, and though it was increasingly made with bourbon, the Scotch Sour never truly went away. In fact, the drink became the basis of a new wave of modern classics, namely the Penicillin , a culture-changing cocktail from New York City’s Milk & Honey . This drink uses the Scotch Sour template but includes honey rather than simple syrup, and utilizes an additional float of heavily peated single malt scotch to highlight the full array of the spirit’s flavors. Why the Scotch Sour Works The combination of spirit, citrus, and sugar is so ingrained in cocktails because of how well the combination works across a wide range of ingredients. But what you get from the Scotch Sour is a predominantly malt-forward flavor that helps to create an earthiness not often found in sweeter, bourbon-based versions of the drink. The 10 Iconic Sour Cocktails Everyone Should Know RELATED ARTICLE Blended scotch tends to be the ideal whisky for a Scotch Sour, though a single malt can work as well. However, if the goal is to increase the peat and smoke elements of the drink, a variation like the Penicillin may be more ideal, where a single malt float allows for more of those elements to come through on the nose with each sip instead of getting blunted into submission by shaking. Though a Scotch Sour can effectively be made using just the three primary components (whisky, lemon juice, sugar), many Sours include egg white to create a creamier texture and rounder mouthfeel. This is optional and can be skipped for a cleaner tasting drink. We do, however, include two dashes of Angostura bitters here, which help accentuate some of the deeper and more tannic elements of blended scotch that can be lost in mixing the drink, bringing them back to the forefront. If using a more heavily peated whisky, the bitters can safely be omitted.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blended Scotch whisky'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add Scotch whisky, lemon juice, simple syrup, Angostura bitters, and egg white (if using) to a shaker, and dry-shake for 30 seconds without ice.', 'Add ice and shake again for 15–20 seconds, until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with an orange twist.']",26,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/frozen-pina-colada-cocktail-recipe-7561393,Frozen Piña Colada,Dylan Garret,"The Frozen Piña Colada, a combination of rum, pineapple , lime, and coconut, is one of the most iconic drinks in the tropical cocktail canon. But despite its omnipresence in beach bars, pop culture, and 1970s songs about attempted infidelity, it can be hard to find one definitive recipe. As the national drink of Puerto Rico, the cocktail’s ties to the island are indisputable, but from there, the origins and recipe specifications get a bit murky. At least two of the Piña Colada’s origin stories go to the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, where two bartenders, Ramón “Monchito” Marrero and Ricardo García, each laid claim to having first created the cocktail in the 1950s. Another San Juan bartender, Ramón Portas Mignot of Barrachina, asserted he created the cocktail in 1963, and a plaque outside the establishment still touts it as the birthplace of the Piña Colada. Conversely, other stories date the combination of ingredients to the 1800s. The debate as to the true origins of the drink rages on today, and likely won’t be resolved any time soon. History's 10 Best Pineapple Cocktails FEATURED IN What this trip through ambiguous cocktail history really means is that, despite being a classic cocktail with a 70+ year history, the Piña Colada doesn’t have a definitive “traditional” recipe. For years, particularly during the craft cocktail boom of the early 2000s, many bartenders took to skipping the blender and preparing their Piña Coladas shaken and served on the rocks or over pebble ice , mirroring industry-wide trends that aimed to “class up” drinks that got a bad rap in the 1980s and ’90s. However, the one thing the two dueling originators of the modern drink, Caribe Hilton and Barrachina, agree upon is that the Piña Colada should be blended and frozen. Why The Frozen Piña Colada Still Works The Frozen Piña Colada mostly adheres to the classic sour template of spirit, sugar, and citrus in the form of lime juice. However, unlike many other classic examples of sours that use liqueurs or simple syrup to provide sweetness, the Piña Colada relies on the natural sugars found in pineapple, as well as those in cream of coconut. The result is a tropical drink that doesn’t taste sticky-sweet or like artificial sugar, but rather showcases the flavors of tropical fruit. Important to note is the need to use cream of coconut rather than coconut milk. Cream of coconut is a thicker and sweetened product that is needed to create the proper balance in a Frozen Piña Colada. Cream of coconut also has a higher fat content that creates a richer texture and mouthfeel, and provides structure to the cocktail to ensure it doesn’t dilute too quickly after blending.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'light rum'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cream of coconut, like Coco López'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'pineapple chunks, frozen'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'ice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Pineapple leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Ahead of time, place pineapple chunks, fresh or removed from the can, in a container in the freezer for at least an hour, or longer.', 'When ready to serve, combine all ingredients except garnish in a blender, making sure to shake the cream of coconut before adding.

https://www.liquor.com/el-pepino-cocktail-recipe-7551077,El Pepino,Dylan Garret,"El Pepino, or “the cucumber” in Spanish, is another riff on the classic Margarita template, meaning it plays on some combination of tequila, lime juice, and a sweetener (typically triple sec or agave nectar). However, the Pepino is a cocktail that has taken on a life of its own, a riff upon which countless professionals and home bartenders have also riffed, each adding elements that aim to bring the drink beyond a simple muddled cucumber Margarita. In 2012, singer and actor Justin Timberlake launched the drink into the mainstream during an interview with Bon Appétit in which he namechecked the Pepino as his favorite cocktail. His version was said to be based on a creation of noted bar professional Junior Merino, which utilizes pineapple in addition to cucumber, tequila, and lime juice, with Grand Mariner as a sweetening agent. Another claim to the origin of the drink goes to Las Vegas-based Gaston Martinez, whose version omits pineapple but includes cilantro for an herbal kick, as well as egg white for texture in the style of a traditional sour. The Expansive World of Tequila, Mezcal, and Agave-Based Drinks FEATURED IN The truth of El Pepino’s origins is probably much more mundane, and it’s hard to definitively credit any single person with being the first to muddle cucumber slices into a Margarita. The recipe you’ll find here leans toward a more classic profile by omitting the pineapple juice to maintain acidic balance while letting the other ingredients shine. It also utilizes agave nectar rather than orange liqueur, in the style of a Tommy’s Margarita . Jalapeño adds an extra kick, and  works to both complement and balance the cucumber. Why the Pepino Cocktail Works When compared to more oddball combinations of esoteric cocktail ingredients, it’s not hard to see why the Pepino works well. The classic elements of a Margarita are all at play, balancing spirit, sweetness, and citrus. Using agave nectar, rather than the more processed and distilled sugar of triple sec , plays off the natural elements of tequila, an agave-based spirit. Additionally, the interplay between fresh lime juice and agave nectar works to accentuate the two primary elements of tequila’s profile—its citrus overtones as well as the spirit’s earthier aspects. This strikes an interesting contrast to a standard Margarita’s specifications, which simply dial up the citrus by adding orange liqueur on top of lime. Meanwhile, cucumber is muddled alongside jalapeño pepper, leveraging the classic combination of cooling and spice, rather than leaning on a single note of either. The amount of jalapeño can be dialed up or down based on heat preference, or even completely omitted if desired. Finally, the spicy-salty rim acts to reawaken the taste buds with each sip, so the Pepino remains engaging through to the final sip, rather than fatiguing halfway through the glass.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': '1/4-inch wheels', 'ingredient': 'cucumber'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '1/4-inch wheels', 'ingredient': 'fresh jalapeño'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Chili-salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add cucumber, jalapeño, and tequila to a shaker.', 'Muddle for 10 seconds until fully pulverized.', 'Add agave syrup and lime juice, then fill shaker with ice and shake for 15–20 seconds until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain through a fine mesh strainer into Tajín-rimmed rocks glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with remaining cucumber slice.']",38,tequila

But for decades, it’s been the unofficial signature cocktail of Austin, Texas, where it has a deeply devoted following. Essentially a Margarita variation, the Mexican Martini was originally created at Austin’s Cedar Door over 40 years ago. As with many cocktail origin stories, the drink’s genesis is a little fuzzy. But according to local bar lore, a Cedar Door employee visited a small border town in Mexico in the early 1980s and was struck by how the Margaritas were served there: up, in an elegant Martini-style glass, rather than on the rocks or in a large Margarita glass. The bar adopted this idea and gave it the Mexican Martini moniker, taking the combination further with olive garnishes and eventually even adding a little olive brine to the mix itself. Margarita 1272 ratings On paper, this Margarita and Dirty Martini mashup may seem a little odd, but for the legion of fans who’ve put away Texas-sized amounts of Mexican Martinis over the years, the sweet and savory combo works just fine. The traditional Margarita ingredients of tequila, Cointreau, and fresh lime juice get a saline boost from a half-ounce of green-olive brine—directly from the jar, as they do it at the Cedar Door. Salt is well known to enhance the flavors of tequila, and the brine delivers on that while adding earthy, savory qualities to the drink. This recipe from Cedar Door offers the option to add a salted rim to the glass, but you may not need it with the brine and olive garnish additions.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'green olive brine, from the jar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'olives', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rub the rim of a Martini glass with a lime wedge, dip the rim in salt to coat, and set aside (optional).', 'Add the tequila, Cointreau, lime juice, and olive brine to an ice-filled shaker and shake until well chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled Martini glass.', 'Garnish with olives and a lime wedge.']",15,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/rosita-cocktail-recipe-7487591,Rosita,Dylan Garret,"The Rosita is a modern classic cocktail most often described as a tequila Negroni , though this simplistic explanation vastly undersells the drink. Both involve a combination of spirit, Campari, and vermouth, though the Rosita splits the latter ingredient into equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, making it more akin to a Perfect Negroni. Further, it incorporates a dash of Angostura bitters, to bring added depth to the bittersweet combination. The Rosita’s history is murky, like that of so many classic and modern-classic drinks before it. Iterations of the cocktail date to at least the 1970s, before an early recipe was eventually featured in the Mr. Boston Official Bartender’s Guide . There, it sat buried in the book’s pages for years until eventually being unearth and riffed upon by bar legend Gary “Gaz” Regan . As Regan wrote for The San Francisco Chronicle , in the mid-2000s fellow drinks writer Terry Sullivan had discovered the drink, but upon further conversation between the two, neither could recall where the origins of Sullivan’s Rosita recipe lay. A bit of digging and the pair finally realized where Sullivan had found his information—in Regan’s own 1991 cocktail book, The Bartender’s Bible . “I didn't remember putting Rosita in The Bartender's Bible , but it's there all right,” wrote Regan. “Where did I steal that one from, I wondered.” The Expansive World of Tequila, Mezcal, and Agave-Based Drinks FEATURED IN The cocktail continues to work on every level. Regan’s version dials up the amount of tequila, deviating further from the equal-parts Negroni template. Splitting the vermouth to include both sweet and dry iterations creates a smoother tasting drink that avoids the sometimes-cloying profile many Negroni variants get from a full sugary ounce of both Campari and sweet vermouth. The final touch, a single dash of Angostura bitters, helps bring additional backbone to the Rosita, and helps to even out this rebalancing of vermouth. The result is a cocktail that perfectly fits the definition of a “modern classic.” It will appeal to those looking for a new spirit-forward tequila cocktail that avoids the trap of yet-another Margarita riff, or for Negroni fans seeking a variation that goes beyond a simple swap of the main spirit.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients to a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir smoothly for 15–20 seconds, until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice, or single large ice cube.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",53,tequila

It has also been famously riffed on and tweaked over the years—and not always successfully. There are entire Reddit threads dedicated to the worst Mai Tai recipes found in the wild. That said, as far as adaptable cocktails go, the Mai Tai is easier than most to alter due to its fairly straightforward ingredient list and recipe. Bartender Ivy Mix, co-owner of Leyenda in Brooklyn, New York, merged her passion for mezcal with this classic drink when she created the smoky, complex Tia Mia—an anagram of Mai Tai.

The cocktail is also featured in Mix’s book, Spirits of Latin America . When Mix first started experimenting with this drink, she floated an ounce of mezcal atop a Mai Tai in place of the dark rum typically used.

Head bartender at the London-based Café Royal and President of the UKBG, William J. “Billy” Tarling curated this compilation of recipes, which features a range of cocktails that were being served in London’s fashionable bars and restaurants at the time. Interestingly, many of the drinks profiled in the book involve some of the earliest known recipes to use vodka and tequila in cocktails, both unusual spirits to mix with at the time. Tequila Martini 51 ratings The original Matador recipe is an equal-parts mixture combining tequila, dry vermouth, and orange curaçao.

This lesser-known recipe would be a fine replacement for a Martini, albeit a more aromatic and slightly less boozy order.

Flores-Mercado found a balance that would appeal to the nature of the original cocktail while keeping in line with Bar Flores’s vision and offering guests something new. “The earthiness and saltiness of [tequila] blend really well with everything that you think of in an Espresso Martini, like coffee and chocolate,” she says. 30 Coffee Cocktails to Kick Off or Cap Off Your Evening RELATED ARTICLE For the coffee component, Flores-Mercado uses a coffee concentrate from nearby Woodcat Coffee and Caffe Lolita Coffee Liqueur. This combination grounds the cocktail with a deep flavor profile that she likens to piloncillo—unrefined raw sugar that has burnt caramel notes. A small amount of Zucca Rabarbero Amaro rounds out the drink with rich chocolate and bitter orange notes, while lemon oils “brighten it up.” “Espresso Martinis are always delicious, but they run a little bit on the sweeter side,” says Flores-Mercado.  “[This] feels like a cocktail and less like a dessert.” When mixing the drink, Flores-Mercado advises to go easy on the ice in the shaker. “Using less ice and giving it a lot of room for there to be a little bit of air in there is what’s going to give you that really gorgeous thick foam,” she says.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila, preferably El Tesoro'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coffee liqueur, preferably Caffe Lolita'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coffee concentrate or cold brew concentrate'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rich honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Zucca Rabarbaro Amaro'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Lemon, for zesting'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: 3 espresso beans', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker filled with 4 ice cubes.', 'Shake vigorously, 15–20 seconds, until chilled.', 'Double-strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a chilled Nick and Nora glass.', 'Zest a lemon over the cocktail, then discard.', 'Garnish with 3 espresso beans.', 'To make rich honey syrup: Add 1 cup honey and 1/2 cup water into a small saucepan over medium heat.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tequila-daisy/,Tequila Daisy,David Wondrich,"In the summer of 1936, James Graham, the owner and editor of The Moville Mail newspaper in Moville, Iowa, took his wife to Southern California for a bit of sightseeing. While there, as many do, the Grahams took a little side jaunt to Tijuana, Mexico, where—again, as many do—they found themselves in the grip of a sudden thirst for something alcoholic. Four years earlier, the choice of drinking establishments would have been a tough one—during Prohibition , Tijuana had some 150 of them. But in 1936, with Americans fully able to drink alcohol at home, the city was down to a mere nine or ten bars. An Irishman by the name of Madden ran one of the survivors, and that’s where the Iowans headed. The couple’s taxi driver had mentioned Madden’s drink-mixing skills and told them of his fame as the creator of a thing known as the Tequila Daisy . Margarita 1272 ratings “As a newspaperman seeking information,” Graham wrote in the lengthy report of his trip that he ran in his paper (bear in mind that Moville had a population of around 975), “I entered the joint and told Mr. Madden my curiosity was aroused regarding The Daisy.” Mr. Madden was not the most talkative of men, but eventually, he was persuaded to admit that the drink’s creation was a mistake. “In mixing a drink, I grabbed the wrong bottle and the customer was so delighted that he called for another and spread the good news far and wide.” Why are we bothering with Iowa newspapermen and Irish barkeepers when discussing a Mexican cocktail? Because, you see, the word for “daisy” in Spanish is “margarita,” and there are few cocktails more popular than the Margarita , or more obscure in their origin. Graham never said what was in Madden’s Daisy, or (truth be told) ever actually admitted to trying one. But if you take a Brandy Daisy, a standard bar drink of the pre-Prohibition era, and accidentally reach for the tequila instead of the brandy—well, you be the judge.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Grand Marnier'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}]","['In a shaker, stir together the lemon juice and sugar.', 'Add the tequila and Grand Marnier, and fill with ice.', 'Shake until well-chilled, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Top with a small splash of club soda.']",54,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brown-derby/,Brown Derby,Liquor.com,"The classic Brown Derby cocktail features bourbon, grapefruit juice and honey syrup. That trio of simple ingredients belies the complex taste of the drink, in which honey bridges the gap between tart citrus and spicy bourbon to produce an intricate combination that has stood the test of time. According to the 2002 book The Craft of the Cocktail by bartending legend Dale DeGroff, the Brown Derby was created in the 1930s at the Vendôme Club in Los Angeles, and named for the hat-shaped diner that was located nearby. However, the cocktail’s origin gets a bit murky from there. 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE The Brown Derby appeared in the book Hollywood Cocktails , published in 1933. But it also appeared under a different name, the De Rigueur Cocktail, in British bartender Harry Craddock’s classic 1930 tome, The Savoy Cocktail Book . Did the former book steal the recipe from the latter and change its name? Were two similar drinks with the same recipe created independently by different people and given different names?

https://www.liquor.com/algonquin-cocktail-recipe-8383879,Algonquin,Dylan Garret,"The Algonquin is a classic New York City cocktail consisting of rye whiskey , dry vermouth, and pineapple juice. It’s thought to have originated during the early 20th century, with published references to the drink appearing as far back as 1935 and various recipes appearing in cocktail books over the following two decades. The drink is believed to have been named after the Algonquin Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where it was likely first created. The hotel grew famous for many of its patrons, particularly those of the Algonquin Round Table, an informal social club of writers, critics, actors and other cultural luminaries of the era, including Dorothy Parker, Harpo Marx, Blyth Daly, George S. Kaufman, Franklin Pierce Adams, and many others. Ironically, the group peaked during the years marked by Prohibition, of which the Algonquin Hotel’s owner, Frank Case, was a vocal supporter—Case prohibited alcohol service at the hotel in 1917, three years prior to it being outlawed. 20 Rye Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE Still, as Prohibition ended and the hotel entered a new era in which alcohol was permitted, the Algonquin cocktail became indelibly associated with the establishment, and lives on as a classic of the era. Why the Algonquin Works The Algonquin features a somewhat unique three-ingredient combination of rye whiskey, dry vermouth, and pineapple juice. It could be seen as a cocktail that hews to the spirit-plus-vermouth base of many popular drinks of the era, like the Manhattan or Martini, with the addition of fruit juice as a modifier. As a highly acidic juice that still provides plenty of sugar, pineapple in effect stands in for both the sweet and sour elements of a classic sour-style cocktail , which combines separate ingredients like simple syrup and lemon juice to create a similar balance. While it’s hard to know exactly when and why these ingredients were originally chosen, they all were hallmarks of the Prohibition era. Rye whiskey was a popular choice at the time, after U.S. whiskey producers were put out of business and many illicit speakeasies increasingly relied on rye smuggled in from Canada. Similarly, pineapple juice makes an appearance in many cocktails of the era, which some say was due to its ability to help cover up off flavors from poorly made or adulterated bootlegged spirits. Important to the Algonquin is the use of fresh pineapple juice without any added sugar, if available. This allows the intended tart and sour profile of the classic to come through and prevents the drink from tasting like sweet, spiked fruit juice.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients except garnishes to a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake for 10–15 seconds until well-chilled.', 'Double strain through a fine mesh strainer into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a pineapple wedge and maraschino cherry.']",17,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/siesta-cocktail-recipe-7484126,Siesta,Audrey Morgan,"When Katie Stipe created the Siesta in 2006 at New York City’s now-closed Pegu Club, tequila classics beyond a handful of well-known drinks, like the Margarita and Paloma , were few and far between. “Our cocktail Rolodex was greatly lacking in solid agave-based recipes,” says Stipe, who is now the bar and events director at Voysey in Portland, Oregon. “Tequila and mezcal really took off in the years to follow and there was a high guest demand for cocktails with agave spirits.” Stipe created the Siesta as a Hemingway Daiquiri riff, swapping the classic’s white rum base for a blanco tequila and replacing the typical maraschino liqueur with bitter Campari . Firmly rooted in the tradition of drinks in the sour category, the Siesta’s tequila and lime juice make it an unlikely cross between its Hemingway inspiration and a Margarita variation. Hemingway Daiquiri 199 ratings Although Siesta specifications have often varied in the years since its creation, Stipe shared her original recipe below. “My personal palate prefers savory and tart, so a heavier 0.75-ounce portion of lime juice and a scant 0.75-ounce pour of simple [syrup] with just a pinch of kosher salt plays well to the bitter notes of Campari and directs it more into a Margarita-style cocktail,” she says. Since its inception, the drink has undeniably become a modern classic—and for good reason. “I’ve met bartenders in cities all over the States that have used the Siesta as their back-pocket recipe and use it as a gateway cocktail for guests who may not love bitter [flavors] or just want to stretch beyond the simple Margarita,” says Stipe.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients to a cocktail shaker and shake with ice until well-chilled.', 'Fine-strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a grapefruit peel.']",46,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/campari-spritz-cocktail-recipe-7377084,Campari Spritz,Prairie Rose,"The spritz cocktail is thought to date to the late 1800s in the Veneto region of Italy. At the time, the northeastern territory of modern-day Italy was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the word “spritz” was derived from the German word spritzen , meaning to spray or splash. As legend goes, visiting Austrians found the local wine of the region too potent and would dilute it with a splash of water. Locally made bitter liqueurs were eventually added for a burst of color and flavor. Soon, the familiar combination of prosecco, bitter liqueur and soda water became the after-work aperitivo of choice. Aperol Spritz RELATED ARTICLE While the Aperol Spritz has enjoyed global popularity, the spritz takes many forms in Italy. The Campari Spritz is one of many variations that has its own distinctive flavor profile. At about 20.5–28% ABV (depending on which country it is sold) Campari is considerably higher in alcohol than many bitter red liqueurs in the same category. This creates a bigger, bolder and more bitter spritz. Quinine and bright citrus zest blast through the bubbles, while the liqueur’s complex finish lingers. Campari’s deep crimson color acts as a visual indicator of the bottling’s more pronounced flavor profile in comparison to its lighter, orange-hued counterpart. The Campari Spritz is a fresh and delicious staple of the sparkling cocktail category and remains an excellent option for fans of bitter and herbaceous flavors.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'prosecco'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'soda water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the prosecco, Campari, and soda water directly into an ice-filled wine glass and gently stir.', 'Garnish with an orange slice.']",54,
https://www.liquor.com/reverse-martini-recipe-7375673,Reverse Martini,Dylan Garret,"The Reverse Martini is a simple Martini variation that takes the classic cocktail’s formula and simply flips the proportion of the two main ingredients—gin and vermouth. Dry vermouth becomes the dominant ingredient, while gin, which is typically the base, is relegated to a supporting role. Though countless Martini variations exist, many of them simply play with the ratios of gin and vermouth, be it the 50/50 Martini , Dry Martini , or Wet Martini . The Reverse Martini is one of the more radical iterations, as it effectively changes the main ingredient. The practice of inverting the proportions in a Martini appears to date back to at least the 1930s, and the drink was reportedly a favorite of famed cook and author Julia Child, who referred to it as the Upside-Down Martini. What drinkers can expect is a Martini that bursts with additional aroma and flavor. The comparatively lower alcohol content allows subtler aspects of the vermouth and gin to shine, as they’re not muted by excessive alcoholic heat. As such, vermouth quality takes on increased importance in this cocktail. Though there are many newer artisan dry vermouths on the market with which to experiment, those looking for a more classical Martini profile may opt to start with staples like Noilly Prat Original Dry or Dolin Vermouth de Chambery Dry. The Reverse Martini is one of the few classics that allow for a full appreciation of these bottlings, which are often only utilized in minute amounts for cocktails, as it allows their grape base and botanicals to take center stage. Understanding the Main Types of Vermouth RELATED ARTICLE Though most modern Martinis tend to skew drier in preparation, the Reverse Martini inverts the traditional early ratio of 2:1 spirit to vermouth (now commonly known as the Wet Martini), calling for two parts vermouth to one part gin. These specs create a drink that still has an appreciable amount of alcohol, though with much less punch than a traditional Martini. It will generally come in at 20–25% ABV depending on the brand of gin and vermouth used, as well as stirring time. The result is a fantastic cocktail that, while painted on the familiar canvas of a classic Martini profile , allows vermouth lovers to better appreciate its nuances. . The Reverse Martini also makes for an excellent brunch cocktail, or a great choice for any other situation in which you’d like to be able to enjoy a classic drink while lengthening your day.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Olive', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine dry vermouth and gin in a mixing glass filled with ice.', 'Stir smoothly, circulating the spoon along the side of the mixing glass, for 30–45 seconds until well chilled.', 'Strain into chilled Nick & Nora, coupe, or Martini glass.', 'Garnish with olive or lemon twist, depending on preference.']",32,gin
https://www.liquor.com/dukes-martini-cocktail-recipe-7374016,Dukes Martini,Dylan Garret,"Hotel bars have long been a hotbed of creation for some of the world’s most prestigious classic cocktails, from the Tuxedo No. 2 to the Vieux Carré , Waldorf , Hanky Panky and the Singapore Sling . And while the original Martini’s origins are somewhat murky (though some theories point to the bar at The Knickerbocker Hotel) an updated variation from Dukes London that debuted in the 1980s has gained renown all its own. Created by Salvatore Calabrese, who helmed the program at Dukes Bar at the time, the Dukes Martini is also known as the Direct Martini. Calabrese has said the drink originated with travel writer Stanton Delaplane (often credited with introducing the Irish Coffee to the U.S.), a patron of the bar who regularly requested a very dry, very cold Martini. The key to the cocktail is its preparation. As drinks stirred long enough to reach the desired temperature were deemed too diluted for Delaplane’s tastes, and those stirred less were insufficiently cold enough, Calabrese eventually placed the gin and glassware in a freezer the night before. When it came time to serve his exceedingly particular customer once again, a small amount of vermouth was dashed into the frozen glass, and topped with ice-cold gin. Delaplane was later said to have called the drink “the best in the world.” The Right Way to Order a Martini RELATED ARTICLE Though Calebrese eventually left Dukes in 1994, the Dukes Martini lived on and has become the stuff of legends, and has remained a fixture of a bar program now overseen by the current bar manager Alessandro Palazzi. Beyond its unique preparation, the Dukes Martini is known for its tableside presentation utilizing custom trolleys, and a generous serving that contains in excess of 4 ounces of frozen gin. As the ice-cold temperature mutes much of the aromas of the gin in a Dukes Martini, a lemon twist is strongly recommended as garnish. Expressing the oils from the lemon peel over the top of the drink creates a more predominantly citrus nose than found on most standard Martinis.","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Store the gin in its bottle in a freezer overnight, along with serving glassware, until both are as cold as possible.', 'When ready to serve, pour chilled vermouth into the frozen glass, and swirl until the inside of the glass is coated.', 'Discard any vermouth remaining in the glass.', 'Pour gin directly into the glass.', 'Squeeze the lemon peel directly over the drink, allowing the oils to express and coat the top of the drink.', 'Rub the expressed lemon peel around the rim of the glass, then place in the drink to garnish.']",57,gin
https://www.liquor.com/freezer-martini-cocktail-recipe-7253947,Bobby Heugel’s Freezer Martini,Audrey Morgan,"Bobby’s Martini is a signature cocktail of Bobby Heugel, bartender and owner of numerous renowned establishments in Houston, including Anvil Bar & Refuge and the newly-opened Refuge. Batching and freezing the cocktail ahead of time allows staff to serve the drink quickly. It’s a technique you can easily employ at home if you’re hosting a crowd or just want to have ice-cold cocktails on-hand. This drink originally appeared on the menu of Tongue-Cut Sparrow , Heugel’s now-closed speakeasy that briefly occupied the same space that now hosts Refuge. Although Heugel relies on a mostly classic formula, he uses a unique blend of juniper-forward Tanqueray London Dry and citrus-forward Tanqueray 10 gins. He also opts for the traditional Noilly Prat vermouth and omits orange bitters. 3 Drinks That Show How Refuge Breathes New Life Into Classic Cocktails FEATURED IN “It almost became a requirement that your Martini have orange bitters in the early 2000s,” says Heugel. “We got away from more classic forms of Martinis, and when we would travel and, especially go to older cocktail institutions, we liked the simplicity of gin, vermouth, and no bitters.” Because this batched drink isn’t shaken or stirred to order, you’ll want to add filtered water to the mixture to ensure proper dilution. Combine the ingredients in a one-liter bottle and freeze for at least a few hours to have ice-cold, ready-to-serve Martinis at your disposal.

https://www.liquor.com/greenhorn-cocktail-recipe-7253975,Greenhorn,Audrey Morgan,"Midori and blanco tequila are two ingredients that don’t often star in stirred drinks, and even less often together. At his Houston bar Refuge, bartender and owner Bobby Heugel combines the bright-green melon liqueur and a high-quality Highlands tequila expression with bittersweet aperitif Suze for a fruit-forward and gently bitter drink. Garnished with a neon-green cherry, it’s a serious cocktail that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Heugel says he was inspired by one of his favorite flavor combinations: agave spirits and melons. Although Midori is often associated with saccharine-sweet Midori Sours, Heugel stresses that the melon liqueur is a quality product that should be respected and used properly. “People forget that Midori is incredibly well-made,” he says. “It just has a rap because of its bright green dyed color, but it’s no different from how Campari is dyed these days.” 3 Drinks That Show How Refuge Breathes New Life Into Classic Cocktails FEATURED IN For the drink’s blanco tequila base, Heugel opts for El Tesoro, an agave-forward Highlands expression with prominent floral and fruity notes that are reflective of the Jalisco terroir. El Tesoro employs several traditional tequila processes that many modern-day distilleries have industrialized, such as the tahona, or stone wheel used to crush agave hearts. While you can swap in another blanco tequila, keep in mind that quality is paramount in a spirit-forward drink like this. Once you have the ingredients on hand, the Greenhorn is easy to construct. “I wanted to make a drink that people could order for a decade,” Heugel says. “I also like the idea that people can make this cocktail at home and at other bars.”","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila, preferably El Tesoro Blanco'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Midori'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Suze'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'green maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, Midori, and Suze to a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a green maraschino cherry.']",18,tequila

The brand’s Floreale Aperitivo is made with a base of dealcoholized wine, which is infused with botanicals including artemisia and Roman chamomile. “It’s like Suze meets St-Germain meets blanc vermouth,” she says. “It’s really unique.” Jump also employs a half-ounce of Seedlip’s Garden expression. While the brand doesn’t market itself as a gin analog, botanical ingredients including rosemary, thyme, and spearmint might bring the spirit to mind. The drink’s namesake is a tea syrup made with August Uncommon’s Far Afield blend, an herbal tea made with ginger, tangerine, and sage. It lends “a little spice and roundness to the drink,” says Jump. Blanc verjus, a tart juice pressed from unripe grapes, adds acidity and sharpness. 18 of the Best Non-Alcoholic Drinks to Make Year-Round RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Martini & Rossi Floreale Aperitivo'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Seedlip Garden'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blanc verjus'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'August Uncommon'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Floreale Aperitivo, Seedlip Garden, blanc verjus, and tea syrup to a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.', 'For Tea Syrup: Combine one part brewed August Uncommon Far Afield Tea and two parts granulated sugar, and stir until fully combined.

This is every juicy, spicy, savory dream wrapped up in a festive salt-speckled bow.” For her zero-proof Spicy Margarita variation, David omits the typical orange liqueur and leans on savory ingredients like freshly-pressed celery juice, cilantro, and jalapeño coins, which she combines with lime juice and agave nectar. “I often find drinking celery juice on its own a little, shall we say, lacking, so the gooey yum of the agave nectar is there to give this drink some texture and weight,” she writes. While traditional Margaritas often feature a salted rim, David opts to add a salt solution to the drink itself. “I keep this simple yet highly impactful solution of kosher salt and water around in a dropper bottle,” she says. “Just as in food, salt helps bring out flavors, accentuate nuances, and draw out layers that would otherwise go unnoticed.” The drink gets dusted with a spicy Tajín rim and garnished with a snackable celery spear.

That didn’t stop Hyatt national bar director Miranda Breedlove from setting out to create a zero-proof version for Chez Maggy at the Thompson Denver. Breedlove was inspired by the restaurant’s chef/partner, Ludo Lefebvre, whose favorite classic cocktail is the equal-parts combination of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth. “I wanted to be able to share the drink with all Chez Maggy guests regardless of whether they choose to consume alcohol or not,” she says. Thankfully, a new wave of zero-proof spirits and liqueurs made the task at hand a lot easier. “I started by looking at each component of the drink and searched for the best way to replicate the overall body, balance, and bitterness of the cocktail,” says Breedlove. She uses Ritual Gin Alternative, which has “a bit of a spicy characteristic to help mimic the heat of a traditional gin,” and Lyre’s Apéritif Rosso to evoke sweet vermouth and lend the drink “sugar, body, and aromatics.” Campari is an integral ingredient in almost any Negroni variation. To approximate its unique flavors, Breedlove reaches for an amaro-like aperitif from Ghia, a brand known for its ready-to-drink bitter sodas. “It adds just the right amount of citrus, botanics, and bitterness to the cocktail,” she says. While a standard Negroni is made with equal measures of each ingredient, Breedlove leans a little heavier on the bitter elements than the gin substitute, aiming to compensate for the lack of alcoholic punch. “Added all together in the right amounts, this drink does a great job of paying homage to the classic alcoholic Negroni,” she says. 18 of the Best Non-Alcoholic Drinks to Make Year-Round RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ritual Gin Alternative'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Lyre’s Apéritif Rosso'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Ghia Apéritif'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin and aperitifs to a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over a large, 2x2-inch ice cube.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",16,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/negroni/,Negroni,Liquor.com,"Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by the dauntless Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century. While at Bar Casoni in Florence, he demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano , by replacing the usual soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel. It’s a widely accepted tale, and one that is documented in “Sulle Tracce del Conte: La Vera Storia del Cocktail Negroni,” which was written by Lucca Picchi, the head bartender at Caffe Rivoire in Florence, Italy, and translates to “In the Footsteps of the Count: The True Story of the Negroni Cocktail.” The count’s fateful substitution resulted in one of the most popular stirred drinks in history, as the Negroni sits next to the Martini and Manhattan in the pantheon of classics. It also launched a thousand riffs, and today the Negroni can be found in myriad iterations at restaurants and cocktail bars around the world. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog Few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni during the course of its 100-year history. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint. Sub bourbon for gin, and you’ve got the Boulevardier , a great cocktail in its own right. Try rum or mezcal in the same equal parts configuration with Campari and sweet vermouth, and you get far different yet equally balanced and impressive drinks . There are more ways to tweak the Negroni than by simply swapping its base spirit. The type of vermouth used can have an impact on the outcome too. Pick one that is more bitter, herbal, floral or dry, and you’ll notice the difference. But Campari? That almost always stays put. You can try experimenting with a different bitter liqueur, and some bartenders do. But Campari is the one ingredient that nearly all Negronis have in common. So, how do you mix the perfect classic version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, and request it at your favorite bar. You’ll gain the barkeep’s respect, make the count proud and, most important, enjoy a good drink.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Campari and sweet vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",1592,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/margarita/,Margarita,Liquor.com,"The Margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in North America—for good reason. Combining the tang of lime and the sweetness of orange liqueur with tequila's distinctive flavor profile, the classic Margarita remains one of the most recognizable and timeless examples of the sour category of cocktails (those that balance a spirit with acidic citrus juice and a sweetening element). What’s less certain, however, is the drink’s origin. Some say the cocktail was invented in 1948 in Acapulco, Mexico, when a Dallas socialite combined blanco tequila with Cointreau and lime juice for her guests. Others say that the Margarita, which translates to daisy flower in Spanish, was an inevitable twist on the earlier Daisy cocktail, another category of drinks that follows a template of spirit, citrus, orange liqueur and soda. Make one with tequila, leave out the soda, and you get a Margarita. But regardless of how or when it was invented, the Margarita has earned its way into drinkers’ hearts. When choosing your tequila, quality is key. Opt for a blanco made from 100% blue agave. If it doesn’t say this on the label, it’s mixto—a tequila composed of up to 49% mystery sugars. And although many people still reach for premade sour mix, using fresh lime juice will result in a vastly superior drink, and is the only way to make a quality Margarita. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog Orange liqueur has long been one of the Margarita's signature ingredients. However, as variations on the classic formula have gained in popularity, what was once a mandatory ingredient is now considered optional by others. A common substitute for orange liqueur is agave syrup, which forms the basis of the Tommy’s Margarita , an iconic variant created by Julio Bermejo in the early ’90s at Tommy’s Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco. When talking Margaritas, it’s easy to get lost in stories about who invented the drink or become mired in debates over salt versus no salt, blended or frozen, triple sec, Cointreau or Grand Marnier, and so on.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dry-martini/,Dry Martini,Liquor.com,"Who mixed the world’s first Martini? Was it a California prospector during the 1849 Gold Rush or the barman at a New York City hotel 50 years later? Most likely, the Martini is a cocktail that came onto the scene in multiple places at once, as an increasing number of bartenders began to experiment with gin and vermouth. One fact we do know: The drink’s original form, according to early recipes, was sweet. Nineteenth-century cocktail books regularly called for Italian (sweet) vermouth. The Dry Martini took its current form by the turn of the century, when the new order of the day was dry gin, dry vermouth, and perhaps a dash of orange bitters for good measure. When making the drink, it’s imperative to start with good ingredients—there’s no place to hide poor quality gin or vermouth in such a straightforward cocktail. Begin with a London dry-style gin. From there, add a little dry vermouth. The ratio is negotiable, but common formulas for a Dry Martini typically fall in the range of four-to-eight parts gin to one part vermouth. A dash of orange bitters ties the room together. Despite the exacting demands of a certain fictional British spy, the Martini is meant to be stirred, not shaken. The cocktail should be clear, and without ice shards. Be sure to stir it for at least 20 to 30 seconds to yield the proper dilution necessary to bring the ingredients into balance. Then, strain it into the glass named after the cocktail itself. Twist a lemon peel over the top, and there you have it: a Dry Martini. It’s a drink worth getting to the bottom of. It’s also a drink that’s spurred countless variations. No, we’re not talking about the ubiquitous ’Tinis of the 1980s and ’90s. We mean the legitimate variations, like the Vodka Martini (self-explanatory), the Reverse Martini (swap your gin and vermouth ratios) and the Perfect Martini, which features an equal split of dry and sweet vermouth. Master the Dry Martini first, then try your hand at mixing its relatives.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cosmopolitan/,Cosmopolitan,Liquor.com,"The legendary Cosmopolitan is a simple cocktail with a big history. It reached its height of popularity in the 1990s, when the HBO show “Sex and the City” was at its peak. The pink-hued, Martini-style drink was a favorite of the characters on the show. It made its debut during the second season and became a series regular after that. For a good decade, the Cosmopolitan may have been the most popular cocktail in America, and bartenders couldn’t work a shift without making dozens of them for thirsty patrons. Naturally, its ubiquity spurred countless riffs, from the White Cosmo (St-Germain in place of Cointreau) to versions featuring gin. While the drink isn’t as popular today as it was in its heyday, the classic recipe is still very much alive. According to bartending legend and author Gary Regan, the original Cosmopolitan was created in 1985 by Miami bartender Cheryl Cook while working at a South Beach bar called the Strand. Eager to invent a new cocktail for the Martini glass, Cook riffed on the classic Kamikaze by using a newly introduced citrus-flavored vodka, plus a splash of cranberry juice. There’s some debate about who created the original Cosmopolitan. Many believe, like Regan, that it was first mixed by Cook. Others believe that Dale DeGroff concocted it at New York City’s Rainbow Room, or that Toby Cecchini first devised a Cosmo in 1988 during his tenure at New York’s Odeon. However, all agree that Cecchini popularized the vodka-and-cranberry ’Tini. His version of the drink called for 2 ounces of Absolut Citron vodka, an ounce of Cointreau, an ounce of Ocean Spray cranberry juice cocktail and an ounce of fresh lime juice, with a lemon twist. The Cosmo was a product of its time. In the late-1980s and early-’90s, vodka was king, but flavored vodka was just finding an audience. When Absolut released its first flavored vodka, the lemony Citron, bartenders had a new toy to work with. Cecchini used it in the Cosmo alongside Ocean Spray, and the vodka-and-cranberry duo is still the preferred pair at most bars today. You, of course, can use whichever citrus-flavored vodka and cranberry juice you like. Just remember: Don’t drown your drink in cranberry. Other cocktails like the Sea Breeze call for a heavier measure of cranberry, but here the juice is meant to be only an accent, adding a touch of tartness and color.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/espresso-martini-2/,Espresso Martini,Dylan Garret,"Though modern variations come in many forms, the original Espresso Martini is a simple combination of vodka, espresso, and coffee liqueur. The drink originated in the 1980s and has seen its popularity vary wildly in the decades since, from one of the most visible representations of the pre-Millennium ’tini era, to a forgotten punchline, followed by a massive resurgence in recent years, almost four decades since its first creation. The most common telling of the drink’s origins is that the Espresso Martini was created in 1983 by London-based bartender Dick Bradsell at Fred’s Club. As the famous story goes, Bradsell was asked by a well-known model to make something that would “wake me up and fuck me up,” prompting Bradsell to create a drink that he originally called the Espresso Vodka. The original cocktail reportedly included two types of coffee liqueur, Kahlúa and Tia Maria, along with a concentrated short pull of espresso, or ristretto . Though Bradsell, who died in 2016, became indelibly tied to the Espresso Martini, his portfolio of cocktails includes a number of drinks that have since become modern classics, like the Green Fairy, Bramble , and Treacle. Why the Espresso Martini Works History has a long tradition of drinks that aim to combine the potent effects of both alcohol and caffeine, whether modern classics like the Espresso Martini, the Vodka Red Bull highball craze of the mid-aughts, or even the original Four Loko. What the Espresso Martini offers, though, is a profile that doesn’t stray too far from those of many classic cocktails. The Espresso Martini essentially follows the same template found in everything from the Manhattan to the Old Fashioned —a base spirit mixed with sweet and bitter elements in balance. Rather than using ingredients like sweet vermouth or Angostura bitters to provide the latter flavors, the Espresso Martini simply uses coffee as its bittering agent, sweetened with a touch of liqueur. Much like a regular cup of coffee, tastes can vary widely on the ideal amount of sugar to include in an Espresso Martini. Below, we include 1/4 ounce of simple syrup in addition to the coffee liqueur, to help bring the drink in line with modern tastes. However, if you prefer a less sweet, more coffee-forward drink, you can easily omit this. The 10 Best Coffee Liqueurs for an Espresso Martini RELATED ARTICLE While we also try to keep this recipe in line with Bradsell’s original style, some prefer to include a splash of milk or cream liqueur, creating something more akin to a Mudslide . It’s an easy cocktail to experiment with, and there are about as many ways to tailor an Espresso Martini to personal tastes as there are different ways to take your coffee. Play around and find which works best for you. Preparing the Espresso If you have an espresso machine, you can pull a short, 1-ounce shot and put it in the freezer for a quick chill. This will keep the hot liquid from melting the ice and overly diluting the drink as you shake it. If you don’t have an espresso machine, substituting cold brew concentrate is a simple hack, though it may lack some of the depth (and caffeine) of a cocktail created with fresh espresso, creating something more closely resembling an Iced Coffee Martini. When it comes to choosing a coffee liqueur, Kahlúa has long been the standard bearer in Espresso Martinis. However, since the drink was first created in the early 1980s, a wider range of coffee liqueurs have entered the market, and options are now much more plentiful than in Bradsell’s Espresso Martini heyday. Explore some of the options, both new and old, recommended by bartenders today and find the flavor profile that works best for you.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/white-russian/,White Russian,Liquor.com,"The White Russian is a decadent and surprisingly easy-to-make cocktail. Combining vodka, Kahlúa and cream and serving the crowd-pleasing drink on the rocks creates a delicious alternative to adult milkshakes. The History of the White Russian The White Russian came about in the 1960s when someone added a bit of cream to the Black Russian , rendering it white. Neither drink is actually Russian in origin—the Black Russian itself is thought to have originated in Belgium, where it was first created for a U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg. Rather, the name is simply a reference to their base spirit, vodka. The White Russian suffered a bit from a stodgy, antiquated reputation for a number of decades, until the 1998 movie “The Big Lebowski” came along and breathed new life into the cocktail. That is, of course, thanks to Jeff Bridges’ character, the Dude, sipping it exclusively—and constantly—throughout the film’s duration. The White Russian’s instant cultural prominence in the film’s aftermath is one of popular culture’s best drinks-related successes. One analogue would be Carrie Bradshaw’s impact on the Cosmo —but then the Cosmopolitan had only been birthed a few years before “Sex and the City” debuted. The White Russian, by comparison, had decades of dust to wipe off by the time “The Big Lebowski” rolled around. Why the White Russian Works The simplicity of the White Russian is the centerpiece of much of the cocktail’s allure. The combination of vodka, Kahlúa and cream is so pleasurable, you could arguably wing the measurements and be rather content with the results. But there’s a magic to getting the proportions of the ingredients just right. When making a White Russian at home, choose a decent vodka. Likewise, because the heavy cream is a core aspect of the cocktail, elect a quality cream. That is, one with which you can taste the dairy’s provenance. A little character goes a deliciously long way. Regarding substitutes: Half-and-half can work in a pinch because it has sufficient body to bolster the drink. It isn’t an optimal choice, but it will play its part well enough. Whole milk—or any type of milk—is a hard no-go. The resulting White Russian will be thin and insipid. Remember: You’re aiming for decadence. Stir well before serving. Yes, the streaks of brown and white in an unstirred White Russian are arresting. (Exhibit A: The photo accompanying this recipe.) Gawk and admire to your heart’s content. Just do it before you drink your White Russian. You want those three ingredients melded like they were born to intermingle—which, in truth, they kind of were.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hurricane/,Hurricane,Liquor.com,"The Hurricane is not a cocktail of subtlety. Its double serving of rum and suite of fruit juices and sweeteners have been packing a punch since the early 1940s, when it was invented at Pat O’Brien’s in New Orleans. According to Shelly Waguespak, the president of the family-owned bar, the Hurricane was created due to a surplus of rum. In the 1940s, rum was easier to acquire than whiskey and other liquors, so Pat O’Brien’s began experimenting with the spirit, eventually landing on the Hurricane. The fun-loving bar continues to sling the cocktail in droves, selling more than half a million glasses every year at its New Orleans location. The Hurricane is composed of two types of rum, lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit puree, grenadine and simple syrup. It’s sweet, fruity and boozy, so it contains all the hallmarks of a good party drink. Ingredients can vary depending on where you source your Hurricane, and it’s common to see the cocktail made with bottled mixers. Fresh citrus, quality passion fruit and homemade grenadine play an important role in balancing the cocktail and taming its sweetness. Besides keeping your jigger busy, this high-octane fruit bomb is an excuse to sip from a Hurricane glass, the tall, curved and alarmingly wide vessel inspired by the hurricane lamp.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/traditional-mai-tai/,Mai Tai,Liquor.com,"The Mai Tai is one of the most famous Tiki drinks in the world. Composed of rum, orange curaçao, fresh lime juice and orgeat (a nuanced almond syrup), it’s held sway over cocktail enthusiasts and Tiki aficionados for decades. It even enjoyed a star turn in the Elvis film “Blue Hawaii.” Victor “Trader Vic” Bergeron is often credited with inventing the drink at his Trader Vic’s bar in the 1940s, though it’s likely that Donn Beach laid the groundwork for the famous recipe during the 1930s at his Don the Beachcomber bar. The original Trader Vic’s recipe featured Jamaica’s J. Wray & Nephew rum. Once Bergeron ran out of his supply, he moved to blending rums in an attempt to create a similar flavor profile. While the Mai Tai was created as a way to showcase the flavors of good-quality rum, it took a wrong turn over the decades as bartenders employed bottled juices and mixers. Those yielded neon-colored or overly sweet cocktails. Fortunately, a renewed interest in Tiki cocktails has returned the Mai Tai to prominence as a fresh, balanced, rum-forward cocktail. Today’s bartenders continue the tradition of blending rums , aiming to find the optimal combination of flavor, depth and complexity. Some barkeeps utilize a crisp white rum alongside a dark overproof rum. Others play with high-ester Jamaican rums and grassy rhum agricole. There isn’t one right answer, but it’s helpful to consider four traits when creating your own rum blend: ABV, age, production methods and the raw materials used to make the rum. Find harmony in the details, and you might create the next great Mai Tai. Once the drink is shaken and served over ice (crushed is best), it’s time for the garnish. Go wild, if you’re feeling creative. Some Mai Tais feature everything from pineapple wedges to cherries on top. But if you’d like to keep the presentation cool and classic, a lime wheel and mint spring are a fine choice. And as for the name: Supposedly, the first person to try the cocktail was said to cry out “Mai Tai!” which means “the best—out of this world” in Tahitian.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mojito/,Mojito,Liquor.com,"The Mojito is one of the most popular rum cocktails served today, with a recipe known around the world. The origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, but it’s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects. Eventually, rum replaced aguardiente and the name was changed to the Mojito. It’s unclear exactly when this transpired, but the Mojito first appeared in cocktail literature in the 1932 edition of “ Sloppy Joe’s Bar Cocktail Manual , a book from the famed Havana institution. Appropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (the island nation grows sugar cane) are joined together and then lengthened with thirst-quenching club soda to create a delicious, lighthearted cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with unaged white rum, which yields a light, crisp flavor. Using Cuban rum will score you points for authenticity, although many modern Cuban rums are lighter in style than their predecessors, so you might try experimenting with white rums until you find one that you like best. The Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, but the end result is worth the effort. The mint combines with the other ingredients for an extra dose of refreshment that, while often associated with summer, can be enjoyed any time of the year If you prefer your cocktails with a dash of literary history, you’re in luck. The Mojito is said to have been a favorite of Ernest Hemingway who, according to local lore, partook of them regularly at the Havana bar La Bodeguita del Medio.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/long-island-iced-tea/,Long Island Iced Tea,Liquor.com,"The Long Island Iced Tea was popularized in the 1970s and remains a beloved drink. It’s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over. On paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works. That’s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today’s refined cocktails fall short: It’s boozy AF—nearly four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you’re a sailor on shore leave (and, probably, even if you are), that’s a red-flag ratio loaded with morning-after consequences. It’s also precisely what a person needs every now and then. So, it’s best not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea. Instead, love it for what it is: a one-and-done cocktail that goes down quickly and gets the job done. That said, even though the drink is rarely served at establishments juicing fresh citrus, it really perks up with the addition of fresh lemon juice. If you’re making one at home, squeeze some fruit for an easy win. And if you’re looking to tame your tea a bit, pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce, and lean in on the cola. The good people of Long Island won’t be offended.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/manhattan-2/,Manhattan,Dylan Garret,"The Manhattan has managed to remain one of the most popular cocktails in the world for well over a century. A combination of whiskey, sweet vermouth, bitters, and a maraschino cherry garnish , this drink embodies the classic, spirit-forward, and aromatic school of cocktails. Thought to have been first created around the 1880s, the Manhattan’s exact origins are a bit of a mystery. Many credible records place its creation at New York City’s Manhattan Club. One telling is that the drink originated with a guest of the club, Dr. Iain Marshall; others more dubiously claim that it was first mixed for Lady Randolph Churchill, the mother of Winston Churchill, who records show was not even in the United States at the time. Another story ties the Manhattan’s creation to a bartender named Black, who kept an establishment on Broadway south of Houston Street, though it’s hard to find corroboration on this theory as well. Despite the inconsistency of the Manhattan’s origin stories, the cocktail recipe itself has remained largely unchanged through most of its history. Though some early outliers exist—notably one written in 1915 by Henry Watterson in History of the Manhattan Club: A Narrative of the Activities of Half a Century in which the cocktail is made with equal parts—a 2-to-1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth has long been standard. The Manhattan is one of the most iconic and enduring examples of the spirit-forward 2:1 cocktail. Unlike the Martini, which has seen its accepted proportions in constant flux since its inception, the Manhattan’s accepted specifications have largely resisted tweaks and popular whims. Why the Manhattan Works The Manhattan’s template is rather simple and shared by countless cocktails, from the Old Fashioned to the Negroni —a base spirit combined with a sweet element and a bittering agent. Sugar acts to soften the spirit, reduce the heat of the alcohol, and create mouthfeel while bringing out the whiskey’s subtler aspects. A couple dashes of bitter reintroduce depth and accentuate the base spirit’s notes of oak aging. The Old Fashioned is a great comparison point and the most stripped-down example of this template. In it, whiskey is paired with sugar, in the form of a muddled cube or teaspoon of sugar, with a few dashes of Angostura bitters. The Manhattan is almost identical, but simply replaces that teaspoon of plain sugar with an ounce of sweet vermouth. To further break down the math, sweet vermouth tends to average 150 grams of sugar per 750ml bottle, which breaks down to about 4.5 grams per fluid ounce, or… one teaspoon of sugar. Manhattan vs. Old Fashioned: What’s the Difference? RELATED ARTICLE Essentially, in a Manhattan, you’re taking the structure of the Old Fashioned from a spirit/sugar/bitter standpoint, but adding a bit more complexity with the sweet vermouth’s flavor and aromatic profile. Simply put, there’s a reason the Manhattan has changed little since its creation, and why so many cocktails are modeled on its 2:1 spirit-to-vermouth ratio. It’s been proven time and time again to be an ideal structural balance of each component. Should a Manhattan Use Rye Whiskey or Bourbon? Often a divisive point among cocktail nerds, the use of rye or bourbon should really be a point of personal preference in a Manhattan. Rye is often touted as the traditional choice and said by some to have been the preferred whiskey of New Yorkers around the time of the cocktail’s creation. However, bourbon offers its own allure, and the cocktail has historically been made with both. Rye whiskey will contribute the spirit’s spicier and more peppery notes to the cocktail, while bourbon will typically be a touch sweeter. As the sweet vermouth already adds richness and a rounder flavor profile to the cocktail, drier rye whiskey is often preferred to act as a counterweight. However, the right bourbon can function in the same way, and there’s enough overlap between the two whiskey styles (as well as variation between individual bottlings) for it to simply come down to taste. In short: Use the type of whiskey you like best.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tom-collins-2/,Tom Collins,Dylan Garret,"The Tom Collins is arguably the most recognizable example of the Collins family of drinks. Generally speaking, a Collins simply means a sour cocktail (those involving a spirit mixed with sugar and citrus) served in a tall glass over ice, and topped with soda water. Or, essentially, a spiked sparkling lemonade. There’s some debate as to the origin of the Tom Collins. According to drinks historian David Wondrich, the drink is probably derived from the gin punches that gained popularity during the early 19th century. A common story is that an enterprising barkeep who worked for Limmer's Hotel in Lodon, John Collins, named the concoction after himself. However, it's arguable whether Collins actually invented the combination of ingredients, or just helped to bring it to the masses. Regardless, these early iterations of the the cocktail were typically made with either genever or Old Tom gin, resulting in the cocktail eventually becoming known as a Tom Collins rather than John Collins. Highball vs Collins Glasses: Why There's a Difference, and Why It Matters RELATED ARTICLE The Tom Collins was immortalized in Harry Johnson’s 1882 book, New and Improved Bartender’s Manual: Or How to Mix Drinks of the Present Style , but has been featured in countless iconic bartending manuals since. It has remained popular for over a century, and helped create the template for other sour-sparkling beverages like the French 75 and many modern spritzes. Why the Tom Collins Works The Tom Collins is basically just a gin sour that's been lengthened with soda water—essentially a gin-sour spritz. The same building blocks that make any sour drink work are at play here, consisting of a balance of sweet and sour in the form of simple syrup and lemon juice, mixed with a similar volume of distilled spirit. Gin is commonly associated with sour cocktails, and botanicals of dried lemon or orange peel are such a staple of the category that most gin styles and brands will take well to the additional lemon or lime juice. Soda water helps to provide welcome dilution, allowing the gin's more subtle botanicals to present themselves and avoid being completely overwhelmed by the potent influence of fresh lemon and sugar. The carbonation, in addition to providing texture to the drink, wakes up the palate and keeps it refreshed, to avoid drink fatigue. All together, the Tom Collins, along with the Highball , helped to popularize the concept of long drinks, which tend to be lower in alcohol by volume and more suitable to sipping over extended periods of time. It's template helped usher in an era where cocktails were seen as refreshment, rather than just a vehicle to consume alcohol.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sidecar/,Sidecar,Liquor.com,"The Sidecar, with a century of history behind it, is probably the most famous of all classic cognac drinks , and it remains a favorite today. The tart, dry cocktail features cognac, orange liqueur and fresh lemon juice, plus a sugared rim, and it’s a direct descendant of the Brandy Crusta , an old New Orleans cocktail that has enjoyed something of a comeback in recent years. The Sidecar was likely invented around World War I. It graced the pages of two books in 1922: “Harry’s ABC of Mixing Cocktails” by Harry MacElhone and “Cocktails and How to Mix Them” by Robert Vermeire. Both books listed the recipe with equal parts cognac, Cointreau and lemon juice, but subsequent versions altered the ratios, calling for two parts cognac, one part Cointreau and one part lemon. The latter formula is still common today and is used for this recipe. The sugared rim is optional when making a Sidecar, but considering that this cocktail lands on the drier side of the sweetness spectrum, a few sugar granules with each sip provide a welcome treat. How the Sidecar got its name is a source of debate: Both a French and English bar claim to have invented the cocktail for a customer who arrived at the location in the sidecar of a motorcycle. That seems plausible enough. Bar veteran Dale DeGroff, however, says the drink’s name references the mixture that’s left in the shaker after straining and served in a shot glass on the side. This bonus is called, that’s right, a sidecar. You don’t have to serve a little shot alongside your Sidecar, but it’s a sure way to elicit smiles from whomever you’re serving—and it’s a great segue to tell the origin story of the cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hot-toddy/,Hot Toddy,Liquor.com,"The Hot Toddy cocktail is the grandfather of hot drinks . Equally at home in a snowbound mountain cabin as it is on an acclaimed cocktail menu, the classic Hot Toddy has one job that it takes quite seriously: warming you up. The Toddy’s origins are in the mid-18th century, and the drink traditionally comprises a spirit, sugar and hot water, perhaps with a lemon peel or assorted spices. In Ireland, they used Irish whiskey. In Scotland, they used scotch. In the United States, well, they used whatever was on hand—often brandy or rum. Today, whiskey usually wins out. But, given the Toddy’s customizable nature, you may find the cocktail laced with a number of different spirits depending on where you drink one. A good Toddy has been known to jump-start mornings, cure colds and play furnace on a frigid evening. Many people believe that its first use was as a medicinal aid. Liquor was known to numb pain, while citrus and sugar (or honey) could soothe a sore throat. Take one sip of the hot, comforting cocktail and it’s easy to see how it has stood the test of time. Sure, the prevalence of central heating and modern medicine may be more effective than a warm drink, but you can’t deny the life-giving power of a Hot Toddy. This Toddy recipe comes from San Francisco bartender Jacques Bezuidenhout and features whiskey, hot water, demerara sugar and a clove-studded lemon peel of lemon wheel. You can use any kind of whiskey you like, and the end result will be delicious. Fortunately, the Toddy is very easy to make. Grab your favorite mug, and heat it with boiling water, similar to how you chill a Martini glass. After a minute or two, dump the water, and build your drink in the same mug by combining your spirit with sugar and more hot water. All that’s left to do is throw another log on the fire and enjoy a warm whiskey embrace.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lemon-drop/,Lemon Drop,Liquor.com,"The Lemon Drop first squeezed to life in San Francisco sometime during the 1970s. Its inventor, Norman Jay Hobday, an out-of-work Vietnam vet turned saloon owner, is also credited with opening the country’s first fern bar, a concept that mixed house plants and Tiffany lamps with throngs of upwardly mobile urbanites. Both were an instant hit. And for two-plus decades, the Lemon Drop dominated cocktail menus from North Beach to Bangkok, hooking a generation of bar patrons on its boozy-tart-sweet mélange of vodka, citrus and sugar. In 2006, Oprah famously served one to Rachael Ray on her show, which is like the ultimate nod of widespread acceptance and further solidified the drink’s place in popular culture. Some mislabel the Lemon Drop as a Martini . But its closest cocktail kin is actually the Crusta , a New Orleans invention that dates to the 1850s and, like the Lemon Drop, is distinguished by its sugared rim. It may be tempting to save time by skipping this important step, but take the extra minute to coat the rim with sugar. It’s worth the effort, and that first saccharine brush against the lips before the onrush of vodka, lemon and orange fills your mouth is the drink’s calling card. While the Lemon Drop is usually served in a cocktail glass, it can also be poured as a shot—a common occurrence at college bars and night clubs. However you choose to serve it, the best results are produced by using fresh lemon juice and simple syrup. Bottled sweet and sour can get the job done if it’s your only option, and that is often the case at bars. But the fresh lemon with the sugar is what gives the cocktail its signature flavor. Besides, if you’re going to indulge, you might as well enjoy the best version of the drink. Not only will it taste better, but fresh ingredients are also less likely to cause ill-effects the next morning. Given the drink’s sweet lemony character, it’s ripe for experimentation. Some bars, and home bartenders, modify Lemon Drops with citrus- or berry-flavored vodkas, while others muddle fresh fruit into the cocktail. But before you start riffing, try the classic.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/classic-bloody-mary/,Bloody Mary,Liquor.com,"The Bloody Mary is one of the world’s best-known cocktails, prized for its ability to jumpstart even the groggiest of mornings. Its origins aren’t exactly clear, but one likely backstory points to the mid-1930s and Fernand “Pete” Petiot, a bartender at King Cole Bar at the St. Regis hotel in New York City. Other sources credit American actor George Jessel, who was said to have favored the combination of vodka and tomato juice as customer of New York City’s 21 Club, though Petiot disputed Jessel's contributions to the creation of drink. Whatever its true origins, the Bloody Mary has persisted as one of the most popular drinks ever created, and a pioneer of savory cocktails. However, due to its complex and freewheeling nature, recipes vary widely, and pinning down exactly what makes for a perfect Bloody Mary is a source of endless debate. What's In a Bloody Mary The original Bloody Mary is believed to have contained seven ingredients: vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, celery salt, Tabasco and lemon juice. But like many classic drinks, it has inspired several variations. Popular versions include the Bloody Maria (made with tequila), the Red Snapper (spiked with gin) and the Caesar , a Canadian creation that features Clamato juice. Throw in the recipes concocted by bars, bartenders and enthusiasts, and the tomato-based cocktail sports countless twists—from heavy on the hot sauce to a splash of Guinness on top. These Are Bartenders' Favorite Tomato Juices for Bloody Marys RELATED ARTICLE More recently, the Bloody Mary has inspired a garnish-based arms race, as restaurants and bars top their drinks with more insane garnishes, including bacon, shrimp skewers, lobster tails and mini cheeseburgers, turning the Bloody Mary into its own brunch. When in doubt, it’s best to start with the classic recipe and work toward the way you like it, whether that is pared down, topped with a pepperoni pizza or featuring your favorite bottled mix. Despite the endless variations and regardless of how you choose to make it, the Bloody Mary’s staying power is not debatable.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-irish-car-bomb/,Irish Shot,Liquor.com,"The Irish Shot is a 1979 invention that quickly took off in Irish pubs and other bars around the U.S. It was first created by Charles Burke Cronin Oat, the former owner of Wilson’s Saloon in Norwich, Connecticut. The Irish Shot is a popular drink for St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there’s no reason you can’t enjoy this fun beer-and-a-shot combination all year long. The Irish Shot is a type of Boilermaker , a style of drink in which a shot of liquor—usually whiskey—is dropped into a beer. But in this case, the shot is a two-part mixture of whiskey and Irish cream. To make the Irish Shot, you’ll need three ingredients: Irish whiskey , Baileys Irish cream and Guinness. The whiskey and Irish cream are combined in equal portions in the same shot glass, and then dropped into a half-full glass of Guinness. It works best to add the cream to the shot glass first, and then slowly layer the whiskey on top. It’s rarely a good idea to chug anything, but the Irish Shot is an exception, as it benefits from quick consumption. That’s because the Irish cream will react with the acidic beer and begin to curdle if allowed to sit for more than a few seconds. And nobody wants curdled cream in their drink. While the above method is the traditional way to serve an Irish Shot, some people skip the shot glass entirely and simply mix all three ingredients in the glass. The visual effects are less impressive, and you lose the excitement factor of dropping a shot into the beer, But it’s less messy and tastes the same. The Irish Shot originally bore the name Irish Car Bomb. Over the years, the controversial and offensive name has been stripped from marketing campaigns and, while still part of the cultural lexicon, has begun to fade. These days, it’s never advised to order the drink by its original name, particularly if you’re in Ireland.

Sweet, creamy, and rich, its popularity harkens back to a time when we took our cocktail cues from the laminated menus of chain restaurants. Which is to say, the Mudslide is not exactly an exercise in balance and craftsmanship. But it sure is an enjoyable concoction. The Mudslide was born in the 1970s at Wreck Bar in Rum Point Club on Grand Cayman Island. Yes, it seems more like an après-ski cocktail than something you’d sip on a sandy beach. But it was invented when a customer wanted a White Russian and the bar tweaked the recipe to feature Irish cream. The effortless drink was a hit, finding its way to the shores of the United States and quickly became a favorite at TGI Friday’s and at home cocktail parties. Why the Mudslide Works Most versions of the Mudslide are drowned in ice cream and served in circus-size glassware, resulting in a brain freeze and your daily dose of calories in one cocktail. There’s a place for such extremity. But the recipe for this Mudslide sways leaner and showcases the spirits rather than only the sugar and dairy. The creamy element is two-fold: Baileys Irish Cream and heavy cream. With all that richness, the drink needs some edge to cut through the dairy assault. In comes the vodka and coffee liqueur, the former slicing through the intensity and the latter complementing the richness while also adding coffee’s singular acerbity. A Mudslide needs “mud” and that is where the chocolate garnish steps in to add a visual hint of “mud,” while also lending additional aroma and flavor. Make a Mudslide after dinner or whenever you have a sweet tooth. Using heavy cream is the best bet here, as 2% milk or skim are too lean to produce the richness a Mudslide requires. If you really want to fancify your drink, swap the vodka for your favorite French brandy. Unconventional, for sure.

It swaps out the usual gin for rum, the vermouth for sherry and the Campari for Tempus Fugit’s Gran Classico, another popular bittersweet Italian liqueur.

The Rum & Smoke is part of a divisive trend of smoked cocktails . There are those who dismiss smoked drinks as a mere fad, but there’s a reason cocktail bars across the world are still burning rosemary and sage and slipping them under glass covers. When done correctly, smoking a cocktail can lead to a delicious result. It’s true that drinks like the Rum & Smoke can lose their smokiness not too long after the lid comes off, but there’s a trick that gives this one an advantage: Rather than relying entirely on a smoked rosemary sprig in the glass, or the smoke caught around the drink for a time after serving, it also features a smoked rosemary simple syrup. The syrup is easy to make, and can add complexity to other cocktails. Besides its use here, it also pairs well with mezcal and whiskey drinks—you can try making a smoked rosemary Old Fashioned with either base spirit.

Two jalapeño coins, with their seeds removed, will yield a conservatively spicy drink. For a more fiery Spicy Margarita, throw in a third coin—or as many as you can handle.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/suffering-bastard/,Suffering Bastard,Liquor.com,"So many classic cocktails are born in the bars of great hotels. The Singapore Sling hails from the famed Raffles Hotel in Singapore, while the Vieux Carré was first stirred at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans. The list goes on, and it includes the Suffering Bastard, which was originally conceived as a hangover cure by the bar staff at Cairo’s Shepheard’s Hotel before the property burned to the ground in 1952. As the story goes, in 1942, Shepheard’s barkeep Joe Scialom was toying with a hangover remedy for troops during World War II. He settled on the Suffering Bastard, smartly employing two liquors with lime juice, aromatic bitters and the stomach-settling powers of ginger beer. The drink was supposedly so popular with its intended audience that troops telegrammed the hotel asking for bulk orders of this liquid fortification to be made and delivered to the front lines. Such a move puts your making this at home and drinking it on your couch in perspective. Today, the common recipe calls for bourbon and gin, though some reports peg the original as containing brandy instead of bourbon. Both spirits make excellent versions of the drink, but this recipe sticks with whiskey. If you can’t find ginger beer, ginger ale also works. The resulting cocktail won’t be quite as spicy, but it will still contain a thirst-quenching, effervescent quality. Interestingly, the Suffering Bastard took a left turn in the 1960s, when it became associated with Tiki culture. Recipes of the period, including one by Trader Vic, began to feature rums as the base spirits, accented by orgeat and curaçao liqueur. But if you want to make the original recipe, skip the rum. Whichever route you go, this cocktail has stuck around for a reason: It will take away your suffering (although too many of these bastards has been known to increase it). To adjust the drink’s potency—or get a jump on tomorrow’s hangover—simply increase or decrease the amount of ginger beer. Then raise a glass to the troops who enjoyed this elixir—along with the man who created it—and knock one back. 10 Bourbon Drinks That Beat the Heat RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'London dry gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, gin, lime juice and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled (about 30 seconds).', 'Strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the ginger beer.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",185,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/champagne-holiday-punch/,Champagne Holiday Punch,Liquor.com,"When it comes to holiday entertaining, especially for larger groups, it’s hard to beat punch . Rather than getting stuck in the kitchen or behind the bar all night making drinks, you can make a large bowl ahead of time and leave yourself free to socialize. And if you’re looking for a holiday recipe that’s light on its toes but still has depth, Erick Castro’s punch checks all the boxes. The co-founder of San Diego’s Polite Provisions and Raised by Wolves , Castro describes the Champagne Holiday Punch as “a blend of holiday flavors in a convivial and bubbly format.” It’s a drink that will take your holiday toast up a notch. Genever , the historic ancestor to modern-day gin, is known for its nutty and earthy flavor. Also called Dutch or Holland gin, it’s a distilled malt spirit flavored with juniper and other botanicals. Full-bodied and malty, if you like scotch or mezcal, then you’ll most likely enjoy genever. But Castro says that’s not the only appeal of this festive holiday punch. “While the recipe calls for genever, which results in a malt-accented beverage rich with baking spice, the beauty of the drink is that it works with virtually any spirit imaginable,” he says. “This comes in handy around the holidays, because after you make two or three of these with the family, the recipe still works even once you run out of genever.” Similarly, while the recipe calls for Champagne, any kind of high-quality bubbles will do. Just be sure to use a drier style; if not, you’ll want to cut back on the simple syrup or risk an overly sweet drink. Cointreau, too, can be substituted for another orange liqueur such as a dry curaçao or a good triple sec. However you make the Champagne Holiday Punch, it will surely be a hit at your next get-together.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cbd-spritz/,CBD Spritz,Liquor.com,"As bartenders and enthusiasts experiment with cocktails, it’s only natural that certain food and wellness trends find their way into those drinks. Such experimentation has given way to turmeric cocktails , low-alcohol drinks, hard seltzers and even CBD, a nonintoxicating compound in cannabis. There are many ways to incorporate CBD into your drink, like dosing it with a dropper of CBD oil, creating your own CBD-infused simple syrup or topping your cocktail with a CBD tonic or soda. The CBD Spritz goes the latter route, calling upon Sprig’s CBD-infused zero-sugar sparkling citrus soda. This made-in-California soda is light and refreshing, and one can features 20 milligrams of all-natural CBD derived from hemp. It does not contain THC, so it’s meant to provide marijuana’s therapeutic benefits without the stony side effects. You could drink the soda on its own, of course, but using it in cocktails is a fun way to combine CBD with your favorite spirits. The CBD Spritz starts with vodka and Aperol, the bittersweet Italian aperitif that’s best known for its use in the Aperol Spritz , which also features prosecco and club soda. The vodka adds a bit more punch to the drink, while sparkling wine is used in equal parts with the CBD soda, giving the cocktail an extra slug of dry effervescence. A grapefruit slice garnish complements the soda’s citrusy character and channels the Aperol Spritz’s orange slice. Whether enjoyed on a sunny patio or sipped on your couch as you wind down after a long week, the CBD Spritz is a cold glass of relaxation.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/saison-highball/,Saison Highball,Kat Odell,"“Traditionally, a highball is liquor and a carbonated beverage,” says Brandyn Tepper, the former bar director for acclaimed San Francisco restaurants Saison and Angler . Calling out one of the world’s simplest, and most classic, cocktails, Tepper cites some of the highball’s earliest iterations, dating back to “the late 1890s, with scotch and carbonated water,” which, he adds, eventually led to the 7 & 7 during the 1930s, with the popularity of Seagrams’ 7 Crown blended whiskey and 7UP. Today’s highball has many more faces. Over the last decade, thanks in part to the world’s growing interest in Japanese whisky , the two-ingredient cocktail has staged an aggressive comeback , with bars across the country offering the sparkling refreshment spiked with brown booze from Hakushu to Hibiki. Yet during his two-year tenure at Saison, Tepper pushed the highball further. Inspired by the simplicity and attention to detail found in Japanese bartending, Tepper credits a closet-size, six-seat cocktail bar in Tokyo named Land Bar Artisan as the inspiration behind his easy, yet meticulous, highball. “Land Bar Artisan owner and barman Daisuke Ito understands that spirits themselves contain flavor, and knowing that, he only uses one or two other ingredients in his cocktails,” says Tepper. Building on this idea, Tepper devised his own inspired modern-day highball, built from a blend of brandies plus hard apple cider. But it’s the nuance in how he treats those few ingredients that elevates Tepper’s drink. To begin, he makes a brandy blend from Calvados, St. George apple brandy and Laird’s 100-proof apple brandy for “zing.” “Those three brandies actually make a very aromatic and delicious apple brandy blend,” he says. For carbonation, rather than reach for soda water, he swaps in Ciderman apple cider, made by Cyril Zangs, a small-batch producer in Normandy, France, who, Tepper says, approaches cider-making like cuvée Champagne. “I believe that there’s upward of 60 different cider apple varietals used to make Ciderman. ... There’s no doubt you are tasting the terroir of the land.” But it’s not necessarily those precise ingredients that make or break the drink. In fact, Tepper notes that the cocktail’s most important element is the temperature of those ingredients. Start with cold brandies. Prebatch the brandy blend and store it in the fridge prior to pouring. Meanwhile, house the cider in the fridge at around 38°F to 45°F. With regard to the spirit blend, Tepper explains that when chilled it has “a silky and almost weighted texture.” Consider the more viscous texture of vodka chilled in a freezer versus the spirit at room temperature. In addition to mouthfeel, the temperature of the alcohol is important because it affects the cocktail’s dilution. When you pour a room-temperature spirit on ice, the dilution process starts immediately and will lead to a more watered-down highball––a drink that, by nature, is watered-down alcohol. With chilled spirits, the ice will melt more slowly, yielding less dilution in the drink. To further prevent dilution, Tepper advocates for a frozen 12-ounce Collins glass. He suggests an ice spear, or two blocks, which should hit about 3 centimeters below the glass’ lip, for aesthetic reasons and so the ice doesn’t slide out and hit the imbiber’s nose or lips upon first sip.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/canchanchara/,Canchánchara,Allison Ramirez,"I asked my grandmother about Canchánchara one day, and she laughed. “Canchánchara? No se.” Canchánchara is said to be the oldest known cocktail in Cuba, dating back to (or before) the Ten Years War in the late 19th century when Cuban guerrillas, known as mambises, began the fight against Spain for independence. It was meant to be a healing drink, equal parts practicality and magic, and most likely served warm, with ingredients from the field that were easily accessible, like sugar cane, lime and honey—a Daiquiri of sorts. It was used to cure the common cold. My grandmother was pretty sheltered growing up. She left Cuba as a young wife and mom in the 1960s and never looked back. In times of illness, the answer to everything for her was (and still is) Vicks VapoRub, an American topical solution with menthol and eucalyptus. No wonder she’d never heard of Canchánchara. Most Cubans I’ve mentioned it to have had a similar skeptical response. I was introduced to Canchánchara by Natalie Beltran and Andrew Tyree, a cool L.A. couple who founded Coast to Costa, an immersive travel company that tailors in-depth group trips to countries like Peru, Mexico, Colombia and, of course, Cuba. Their Cuba trip typically begins in Old Havana but then always moves to Trinidad, for a night or two, just about a four-hour drive away. “When bringing our group to the colonial town of Trinidad, nothing starts the visit off better than a fresh Canchánchara. It’s refreshing but packs a punch and will get you dancing in no time,” says Natalie. Founded by the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, Trinidad prospered during the colonial period, growing rich from the labor of enslaved Africans working on sugar plantations. Wealthy European landowners built many historically preserved buildings, securing Trinidad's status as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. It’s a town where most bars serve Canchánchara, with some recipes utilizing aguardiente, or “firewater.” Essentially, it’s just rum in its most stripped down state—sugar cane juice that has been fermented and contains anywhere from 29% to 60% alcohol by volume. “I do know that the drink was pre-colonial and enjoyed by the native Taino people,” says Natalie. “I’ve heard they used to drink it out of gourds, but there’s a family of potters that now make the cups out of clay in the shape of a gourd. They are sixth-generation potters in Trinidad.” The pots are referred to as copas de barro, minus the base or the stem. One man, known throughout the village as just Chichi, is a master potter who handcrafts the clay mugs with no handles and then makes and proudly serves the cocktail to guests himself. But he’s not the only one. There’s an entire bar in Trinidad devoted to the drink, and with a name like Taberna La Canchánchara, it can’t possibly be a bust. Plus, there’s live salsa music at Taberna and almost everywhere you turn in this oft-overlooked town. I think it’s important to note that creative liberties can be taken when making this cocktail, as long as it doesn’t stray too far from the original and whether its sole purpose is to cure you of an ailment or get you on the dance floor. 6 Cuban Cocktails for Drinking Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'aguardiente'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'splash', 'ingredient': 'club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, juice of one lime and honey syrup into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a clay or glass mug filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with a splash of club soda.', 'Garnish with a lime wedge.']",116,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-fever-punch/,Ginger Fever Punch,Liquor.com,"Punch is the ultimate party drink, whether it’s in a traditional punch bowl for holiday gatherings or made by the glass for smaller affairs, it’s hard to beat punch for entertaining. This seasonal stunner is the work of Shawn Chen, the beverage director at Decoy and RedFarm , two modern Chinese restaurants in Manhattan. He calls it the “ultimate holiday cocktail made to please a thirsty crowd,” with flavors inspired by seasonal ingredients, specifically “ginger, cranberry sauce and lots of booze.” Those ingredients also happen to be pretty much in-season year-round. So while Chen’s Ginger Fever Punch is appropriate for winter holiday reveling, it would also work well for summer get-togethers and the like. Although the Ginger Fever Punch calls for tequila—which complements the sweet, tart and earthy nature of pomegranate as well as the spice from ginger—Chen champions the recipe’s versatility. “You can serve this with any spirit, and it would be equally delicious,"" he says. Vodka would create a brighter, less spirited flavor profile while a spirit like brandy, rum or whiskey would give the punch a darker, more lush tone. Darker spirits can potentially raise the sweetness of the drink, especially rum, so be sure to taste for sugar content before making a big batch. If too sweet, pull back on the pomegranate juice. The quantities below make one cocktail but can be multiplied to fill a punch bowl. If going large format, it’s advisable to keep the ginger beer separate from the punch and top each individual glass with it. For said ginger beer, Chen uses Fever-Tree, a brand of high-quality sodas popular amongst bartenders. These days we’re blessed with a plethora of ginger beer options on shelves, though. Those who want their punch with extra ginger spice can find it in brands like Bruce Cost, Q and Reed’s Extra Ginger. 3 Great Recipes for Holiday Punches FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pomegranate juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'goji ginger syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Fever-Tree ginger beer, to top'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: pomegranate seeds', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: grapefruit slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: rosemary', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, lime juice, pomegranate juice, grapefruit juice and goji simple syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with ginger beer.', 'Garnish with pomegranate seeds, a grapefruit slice and a rosemary sprig.']",242,tequila

If you do two things, safely light something on fire. This aptly named drink from veteran New York and Los Angeles bartender Yael Vengroff lets you do both. Dubbed Set the New Year on Fire, it features single malt scotch, Campari, mint, lime juice and simple syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/beauty-elixir/,Beauty Elixir,Ari Bendersky,"At Beauty & Essex Los Angeles , an opulent 10,000-square-foot playground in Hollywood, this cocktail stands out for its simple, refreshing elegance. The Beauty Elixir cocktail features gin, brut sparkling wine (cava, to be exact), strawberry purée, cucumber-infused water, lemon juice and simple syrup, served in a coupe glass and garnished with a dehydrated lime wheel. This drink is incredibly refreshing—some might say it goes down a bit too easy—and is as post-worthy as its name indicates. While the Beauty Elixir is an excellent choice year-round, it’s particularly satisfying in warmer weather (just be sure to pace yourself, especially in higher temperatures). Originally, this picture-perfect cocktail debuted in 2010 at the grand opening of Beauty & Essex in New York City, and it’s now served at both locations as well as in Las Vegas on the third floor of The Cosmopolitan, an iconic (and aesthetically fitting) resort on the Strip. The Beauty Elixir has remained on the menu for over a decade, which is somewhat rare, but is unsurprising given the drink’s visual and flavor appeal. It’s especially a favorite in Hollywood, where the temperate weather and multiple outdoor spaces set the perfect scene for sipping a round or two. When making your own Beauty Elixir, fresh is best, as with almost any other cocktail—however, fruit purée is generally an exception as you can find some great ones at the store (the bartenders at Beauty & Essex use the Funkin brand).

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sugared-cranberry-ginger-mimosa/,Cranberry-Ginger Mimosa,Liquor.com,"The winter season is a time to host dinner parties and celebrate, as colder weather drives everyone indoors and to hearty meals and drinks. When hosting a get together, date or quiet dinner party, it’s nice to have some crowd-pleasing drinks on hand, especially those that are easy to throw together but are still sure to impress. This three-ingredient celebration cocktail from The Cookie Rookie —a cooking and recipe blog founded by home cook Becky Hardin—is an ideal answer, a simple-to-make but delicious mix of ginger beer, cranberry juice and Champagne. The Cranberry-Ginger Mimosa is perfect for every winter holiday, from Thanksgiving straight through to Valentine’s Day, and is a breeze to make. Unlike the more familiar Mimosa you would have with brunch, this one doesn’t have any orange juice, instead substituting cranberry juice. Ginger beer adds some spice, some sweetness and more carbonation, and the choice of which brand you go with is entirely up to your taste preferences. Some are spicier with lots of raw ginger, while others are closer to ginger ale as far as sweetness and spice. If you’re really ambitious, you can even make your own . Similarly, it’s up to you to decide the best sparkling wine to use. Champagne is always going to be a good fit, though it’s best to avoid using one that is too expensive since you’ll be adding cranberry juice and ginger beer. As with most sparkling drinks like the French 75 , Aperol Spritz , and the namesake Mimosa, you can opt to use another kind of bubbly like cava, prosecco, cremant d'Alsace or one of the many other sparkling wines available. With ginger beer and juice both comprising a good portion of the drink, the Cranberry-Ginger Mimosa has the benefit—or drawback, depending on your approach to drinking—of having relatively low alcohol, essentially half the amount of a standard glass of wine. This makes it a perfect drink to start a meal, before people have had time to eat. It also means the drink is a nice nightcap to indulge in while minimizing the risk of a rough next morning. Keep in mind, though: There’s still plenty of sugar in the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/west-75th/,West 75th,Liquor.com,"Wine is certainly no stranger to being a cocktail ingredient, especially sparkling wine in drinks like the iconic French 75 . But one lesser-known wine-topped cocktail is the New York Sour , which sees a traditional Whiskey Sour topped with a layer of red wine. The West 75th, Torrence O’Haire’s festive fizz at American restaurant The Gage in Chicago, brings together elements of both. It does so by combining the wine from each drink in the form of a lambrusco, Italy's famed sparkling red wine. In particular, O’Haire opts for Cleto Chiarli Pruno Nero, but any good-quality lambrusco can do the trick, here. “The two drinks meet in the middle as a Brandy Sour, topped with sparkling red wine,” says O’Haire, who is the beverage director and sommelier for Gage Hospitality Group . “The lambrusco gives the cocktail both bright, fresh sparkle... and fruity richness.” Rather than gin, or the whiskey in a New York Sour, O’Haire opts for Calvados, an apple brandy from Normandy in France. While using a brandy, especially an apple one, might seem odd at first, it has precedence. While most French 75s are made with gin, it’s unclear what the original drink was made with , with plenty of evidence pointing to brandy as the base spirit. Even today many cocktail bars offer both options when putting a French 75 on the menu. A housemade raspberry syrup brings sweetness to the drink, standing in for the usual simple syrup. The berries help coax out the fruitiness of both the lambrusco and the Calvados without making it overly sweet, while some fresh lemon juice balances the drink with tartness. Unlike its two parent drinks, the West 75th also gets a few dashes of Angostura bitters, which lends even more depth of flavor. Traditionally the drink is served in a Champange flute, but one variation is to serve it in a rocks glass over ice. Either way, you’ll want to carefully pour in the lambrusco, optionally over the back of a spoon, in order to get that nice layer of red atop the drink.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Calvados'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'raspberry syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lambrusco'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Calvados, lemon juice, raspberry syrup and orange bitters to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Champagne flute.', 'Slowly top with the lambrusco to create a layered effect.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",20,

Likewise, adding as simple a touch as some bitters and a sugar cube can transform a glass of sparkling wine into a stunning nightcap, as with the Champagne Cocktail . One liqueur that is often mixed with sparkling wines is crème de violette. Known mainly for its use in the classic Aviation , the liqueur is made with macerated violets, giving it a heavily floral aroma and a lush, sapphire hue. Unfortunately, in some drinks, even the Aviation, it can turn more of an off-gray blue than a vibrant violet. Patricia Grimm, the beverage director at Adele’s in Nashville, wanted to create a light, bright brunch cocktail that highlighted the elegant floral flavors of crème de violette without the dull tinge it can lend to drinks. “When added to a clear spirit, it typically reads gray, which belies its vibrant taste,” she says. However, its notes pair beautifully with both sparkling wine and with gin. The answer, then, lay in swapping out the traditional sparkling white wine for something darker: lambrusco, the sparkling red wine from Italy. “The earthiness of lambrusco and gin botanicals work great with the violet floral notes,” Grimm says. In the La Violetta, Grimm uses Boodles London dry gin. Well-regarded for its good quality and affordable price point, it’s a natural choice for use in a busy bar. But don’t feel constrained by it. You can use whatever dry gin you have on hand, or switch it up for an even more floral option, like Hendrick’s or Tanqueray 10. For the essential ingredient of crème de violette, Grimm opts for Rothman & Winter crème de violette . One of the most popular brands of the liqueur, it was the first to reintroduce crème de violette to the American market when Haus Alpenz began importing it in 2007. Today, there are a few other options, including ones from Drillaud, Giffard and Bitter Truth. Finally, the drink gets a bit of lemon juice, which adds some nice acidity, making a bright, floral and visually intriguing sparkling drink.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Rothman & Winter crème de violette'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lambrusco'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dehydrated lemon whee', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, creme de violette and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a coupe.', 'Top with the lambrusco and stir gently and briefly to combine.', 'Garnish with a dehydrated lemon wheel or fresh lemon twist.']",20,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/figurati/,Figurati,Liquor.com,"In Italian, the name of this effervescent elixir from bartender Nathan Elliot means “don’t worry about it.” One look at its easy build-in-the-glass recipe and low-ABV day-drinkability, and you can see why. Unlike many sparkling wine cocktails , the Figurati doesn’t use Champagne, prosecco or any other white, or even rosé, sparkling wine. Instead, Elliot uses lambrusco, and the famed Italian sparkler from Lombardy is an ideal base. Many drinkers only know lambrusco as Riunite, an inexpensive and widely produced brand that was popular in the 1970s. However, it’s a broad style of wine that has plenty of more compelling examples, many of which work well in cocktails like the Figurati. “While being light and effervescent, lambrusco is still full of depth and character,” says Elliott, who crafted the Figurati when he was the lead bartender at Il Solito in Portland, Oregon. “It also provides just enough sweetness to satisfy most palates without being overly sweet; it’s a great variant to the traditional sparkling white wine.” To bolster the wine, Elliot adds Cappelletti aperitivo. This red-orange Italian liqueur is similar in ways to Campari , though it has a wine base, a lower ABV and is colored with natural carmine. You can even use it to replace Campari in your favorite Americano or Negroni recipe, which will lead to a slightly drier and lighter flavor. To give it even more red color, as well as a punch of botanicals, Elliot mixes in two dashes of Peychaud’s bitters. Most famously used in the Sazerac , these historic New Orleans bitters have elements of gentian, anise and citrus along with a crimson hue. The Figurati is best served as a pre-dinner aperitif, especially when paired with some charcuterie or cheese. Or, try replacing your usual Aperol Spritz with the Figurati for your next patio happy hour. You might even find a renewed love of lambrusco through it.

https://www.liquor.com/love-potion-cocktail-recipe-5111985,Love Potion,Liquor.com,"Michael Pedecine, the head bartender at Gabriel Kreuther , a two-Michelin-starred restaurant in New York City, created this cocktail in honor of Valentine’s Day. It’s an advanced riff on a Between the Sheets , a cocktail that, like this one, splits its base between cognac and rum, adding orange liqueur and lemon juice into the mix. In his variation, Pedecine calls upon a dark pot-still rum, rather than the light rum his inspiration uses, to stand up to the intensely flavored alchermes he includes, which, he says, plays beautifully with the vanilla and spice notes of the cognac. He adds pinot noir grape juice for its balancing acidity, which also serves to bolster the cognac’s fruity notes. Alchermes dates back to the eighth century, when it was renowned for its healing properties and was thought to be especially effective in healing the heart, says Pedecine. The modern version is spiced and herbaceous, slightly medicinal yet bright. The ancient healing elixir, he says, would have been prepared with gold flakes or crushed pearls. To mimic that, “I’ve included a touch of Luster Dust for whimsy but also to harken back to the magical nature of alcharmes,” he says. The cocktail represents “a perfect celebration of love, health and better days ahead,” says Pedecine. Let’s all raise a glass to that.

https://www.liquor.com/pink-lady-cocktail-recipe-5217012,Pink Lady,Liquor.com,"Appearances can be deceiving, and such is the case with the Pink Lady: Freshly squeezed lemon juice plays alongside pomegranate-based grenadine, and the drink packs a two-spirit punch of gin and applejack that belies its pretty pink hue. Like many Prohibition-era cocktails, the Pink Lady has an ambiguous history: Its invention was likely a solution to the cheap gin that marked the age; adding other ingredients like brandy, lemon juice, and grenadine helped to mask the unpleasant flavor of the poor-quality spirits available at the time. The Pink Lady became a favorite of high-society ladies from the 1930s to the 1950s, and its reputation as a “girly” order was perhaps solidified in the 1951 title The Bartender’s Book , by Jack Townsend, the president of New York’s bartender’s union: “Why, surely you know her,” Townsend wrote of the typical Pink Lady imbiber. “She's that nice little girl who works in files, who's always so courteous but always seems so timid…Naturally you never expected to see her at a bar. She gets into one about twice a year, at Christmas time or some other high old time.” Sexism aside, Townsend didn’t underestimate the drink’s potency: “Just why she picks the Pink Lady for these occasions—since the Lady packs quite a wallop—remains a mystery, even to her perhaps,” he continued. These quotes might not have aged well, but the grenadine-tinged twist on a Gin Sour certainly has, thanks to a perfect mix of boozy ingredients and softening flavors. Gin lends botanical notes that pair well with the tart lemon juice, while a splash of applejack, also known as apple brandy, plays off the grenadine’s fruitiness and helps fortify the drink. A bit of grenadine pulls double duty, sweetening the cocktail while also giving it its namesake hue. Lastly, shaking the drink with an egg white creates a silky texture and a frothy top that only adds to this Lady’s classic good looks. If it seems familiar, you might have in mind the similarly pre-Prohibition Clover Club , which calls for raspberry syrup instead of grenadine and omits the applejack. When you’re shaking up a Pink Lady, opt for high-quality ingredients like a good London Gry gin and a craft grenadine (you might even make your own ). As is the case with most egg-white cocktails , you’ll want to use pasteurized eggs and dry-shake your ingredients first without ice to emulsify the egg whites. One sip, and you’ll understand why this pretty pink cocktail is more serious than it appears.

https://www.liquor.com/ruby-hearts-cocktail-recipe-4797104,Ruby Hearts,Kelly Magyarics,"Campari is best known for its use in the classic Negroni , a drink featuring equal parts gin, sweet vermouth and the bitter Italian liqueur. But given its distinctive flavor, bright-red color and modest proof (24% ABV), Campari is a workhorse ingredient that shines in a variety of cocktails, or beer-tails, as seen in the Ruby Hearts. “Campari is very versatile: Fruit, spices and herbs are good enhancers,” says bartender Melissa Romanos. She cites citrus, pineapple, berries, basil, thyme and baking spices as having particularly good affinity. “Campari lends itself to sours, beer cocktails and Tiki-style drinks.” The important consideration is combining the proper ratio of ingredients. “The best way to overcome any misconception toward a particular spirit is by showcasing [it] in a way that highlights its best qualities and perhaps downplays those qualities people may not find friendly,” adds Romanos. The Ruby Hearts is a most unexpected cocktail. In addition to Campari, it features mezcal, cinnamon-demerara syrup, lime juice and Bell’s Two Hearted Ale, an American-style IPA from Michigan. “Two bitters don’t make an extra bitter,” says Romanos, who created the Ruby Hearts while working at The Publican in Chicago. “The grassy, smoky notes in Unión mezcal and the richness of the cinnamon demerara provide just enough balance to the bitterness in both the ale and the Campari.” What the #$@!

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/toblerone/,Toblerone,Liquor.com,"The Toblerone chocolate bar was invented in Switzerland in 1908. It’s made with milk chocolate, nougat, almonds and honey and for years has been a go-to choice for chocoholics and duty-free shoppers. Turns out, you can also drink it—or something like it, at least, thanks to this Toblerone cocktail recipe. That’s great news for anyone who prefers their candy bars boozy and potable. The Toblerone cocktail is a rich after-dinner drink inspired by the iconic Swiss chocolate. It is nutty, creamy and decadent. It features three liqueurs: Kahlúa, which is produced in Mexico and made from rum, sugar, and arabica coffee; Frangelico, an Italian liqueur flavored with hazelnuts; and Baileys, the popular Irish cream liqueur. Heavy cream and honey syrup join the three alcoholic ingredients for a touch more texture and sweetness, and a chocolate-coated rim and a garnish of Toblerone chocolate shavings complete the indulgent recipe. This isn’t a health drink. But it is a liquid interpretation of the classic candy bar and a great opportunity to drink your dessert without visiting the candy aisle or airport. Make this sweet, satisfying cocktail after dinner or whenever your sweet tooth cannot be ignored.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hot-blooded/,Hot Blooded,Liquor.com,"When you think of cocktail power duos, a few combinations come to mind, like gin and dry vermouth, American whiskey and sweet vermouth, or perhaps a tropical one like rum and pineapple. Whiskey and hot sauce, however, are two ingredients that don’t immediately jump up and announce themselves as complementary bedfellows. The Hot Blooded cocktail may change your mind. It combines rye whiskey with Ancho Reyes—an ancho chile liqueur from Puebla, Mexico—plus blood orange juice, lime juice, simple syrup and hot sauce. Rye whiskey is a cocktail go-to with a spicy bite that’s featured in classics like the Manhattan and Sazerac . Ancho Reyes is made from mature red poblano chiles, which are harvested and then left to dry in the sun, turning them into ancho chiles with a rich, smoky flavor. Things are off to a good start, but the cocktail needs balance, which comes via the two types of citrus and simple syrup. Blood oranges, which predominantly hail from Sicily, are the most common variety of orange grown in Italy. They’re also common throughout southern Spain and the U.S., particularly in Texas and California. Depending on where they grow, blood orange season can last from November or December until the early spring. When they’re in season, bartenders and chefs flock to the flavorful fruits, which have a deeper, richer taste than Navel oranges. Lime adds another citrusy note to the Hot Blooded cocktail, while simple syrup smooths any rough edges and provides a touch of sweetness. The kicker comes from four dashes of hot sauce, which is a large enough portion to make itself known, but not so much to overwhelm the other flavors in the drink. If you’re up for the challenge, the cocktail features a unique garnish: heart-shaped blood orange and lime peels alternated on a skewer. Those don’t make the drink taste any better, but they sure look cool. And that counts for something.

Valentine’s Day drinks tend to be sweet and sticky, more candy than cocktail. Not so with this simple, pink-hued spin on the classic Gimlet . The Gimlet is made with a trio of ingredients: gin, lime juice and simple syrup. The Bitter Hearts Know Better features hibiscus-infused gin, lime juice and simple syrup, plus a dose of gentian amaro, which gives the drink a light, herbal bitterness that’s in step with its name. The hibiscus gin is responsible for that gorgeous color, and it can easily be created at home by adding dried hibiscus flowers to a bottle of gin. The gentian amaro in this recipe comes from California-based Lo-Fi, which merges white wine and grape spirits with gentian root, cinchona bark, hibiscus, ginger, anise and other flavors, adding a refreshing fruit character and crisp bitterness to the cocktail while pairing deftly with the hibiscus-infused gin. Bitter Hearts Know Better is recognizable as a twist on the Gimlet , but the hibiscus and amaro provide floral and earthy qualities that separate it from the classic.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-little-kiss/,Little Kiss,Liquor.com,"Chocolate covered strawberries are so ingrained with the idea of romance that it’s practically a cliche at this point. But there’s a reason for it, as the treat is a truly enticing indulgence. Throw in a glass of Champagne, and you have a perfectly lovely evening (or afternoon, or morning. No one will judge you). The Little Kiss, from Talmadge Lowe , beverage director at the Hospitality Collective, combines all of these elements into a single glass, with strawberry shrub and white crème de cacao topped with Champagne. Shrubs are a family of drinking vinegars , often used in cocktails or mixed with sodas for zero-proof drinks. The strawberry shrub used in the Little Kiss brings some tartness to the drink as well as fruitiness, which helps to balance the sweetness of the white crème de cacao. If you find you have a lot left over, it can also be used in other drinks, including the Jack & Dabs , a bright and zesty drink with gin and sherry over crushed ice. Fresh strawberries are the preferred ingredient for making the shrub, but thawed frozen strawberries will give plenty of juice and sweetness. Furthermore, they’re far more accessible during the winter than ripe, fresh strawberries. When it comes to crème de cacao, it’s important to use a white version, rather than a dark one. The white chocolate notes pair better with the strawberry shrub and sparkling wine, and the color keeps the drink from being muddy and cloudy. For the sparkling wine element, Champagne is always a good choice, as its dryness and brioche notes adds to the richness and complexity of the drink. However, if you don’t want to drop the cash on a bottle of Champagne, another sparkling wine like a Crémant d’Alsace, prosecco, or cava can stand in. Just be sure to use a wine that has little-to-no residual sugar, as the drink can be too sweet and cloying otherwise. A sparkling rosé, Champagne or otherwise, is a solid choice with the Little Kiss, amplifying the fruitiness of the strawberry and the brightness of the pink flush without raising the sweetness.","[{'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white crème de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'strawberry shrub'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add strawberry shrub and crème de cacao into a chilled Champagne flute.', 'Slowly pour in Champagne.', 'Garnish with woodland strawberry or tiny regular strawberry.']",0,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-maxwell-cocktail/,Maxwell,Liquor.com,"Cocktails are fun and festive harbingers of a good night, but when you make drinks with sparkling wine, you bring an extra dose of effervescence to the party. Champagne cocktails are a diverse bunch, ranging from classics like the gin-spiked French 75 and the moody, absinthe-laced Death in the Afternoon to creative originals, like the Maxwell. This refreshing cocktail comes from H. Joseph Ehrmann, a lauded San Francisco bartender and the owner of Elixir Saloon , one of the Bay Area’s oldest bars. It’s a fine option for a date, as the recipe makes enough for two drinks. Call up a companion before you break out your bar tools, and you’ll have someone to share it with. The Maxwell features cucumber vodka, Cointreau , fresh cucumber and lemon juices, agave nectar and a Champagne topper. The lightly flavored vodka is sweetened with the small measures of orange liqueur and agave nectar, but the cucumber juice, lemon juice and sparkling wine keep the flavor profile squarely in the light-and-refreshing camp. There are a couple ways to get that cucumber juice. Since the recipe only requires a small amount, you can muddle some cucumber in a separate container until you reach the necessary volume. Or, if you have a juicer, throw the vegetable in for a quick fix. The juicer is especially helpful if you plan on making more than one round of drinks, as one medium-size cucumber can yield a full cup of juice. Set the juice aside, and you’ll be ready to accommodate refill requests. With its bubbly character and notes of citrusy lemon and hydrating cucumber, the Maxwell is ideal for the summer months when the weather’s warm. But don’t dismiss this recipe during other times of the year.

And if that wine happens to be Champagne or another sparkling variation, even better. But just because you’re drinking sparkling wine doesn’t mean you can’t also have a cocktail. No, we’re not talking about double-fisting; we speak of bubbly drinks like the French 75 and the Kir Royale. While the former requires gin, fresh lemon juice and sugar in addition to Champagne, the latter is an effortless duo featuring solely sparkling wine and crème de cassis. It’s simple, sure, but it tastes more complex than its constituent parts. The Kir Royale is a take on the Kir, a popular French drink combining dry white Burgundian wine with crème de cassis that dates back to the 19th century and was further popularized after World War II. The Kir Royale sets itself apart by specifically calling for Champagne, while another variation, the Kir Imperial, calls for sparkling wine and raspberry liqueur rather than cassis. Aside from being delicious, the best thing about the Kir Royale might be how easy it is. The scant half ounce of crème de cassis permeates the Champagne, resulting in a gorgeous cocktail with a hint of berry sweetness. Be sure to pour the liqueur into the glass first, followed by the Champagne, which ensures the ingredients will mix naturally. A bit more or less cassis can fine tune the cocktail to one’s individual taste, turning any glass of bubbly into a special occasion and turning heads at your next party. 5 Wine Cocktails to Drink Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de cassis'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Dry Champagne (or other sparkling wine)'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Pour the creme de cassis into a Champagne flute.', 'Top with the Champagne.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",117,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/wine-brownies/,Pinot Noir Chocolate Brownies,Liquor.com,"Red wine and brownies: two of life’s purest forms of indulgence. And while you can always enjoy a plate of brownies with a glass of wine, this decadent recipe easily combines the two, with rich, dark chocolate from Ghirardelli accented by pinot noir. There’s an old adage that says you only want to cook with wine that you would want to drink; that remains true with this recipe, as even the small amount of pinot noir used in the brownies will come through. Perhaps even more relevant, though, is the fact that only using two tablespoons of wine means you’re more than likely still looking at a pretty full bottle, unless you’re using it for another dish. That means you’ve got some wine to drink with your brownies (or while you’re making them), so you’ll want to select something good. Burgundy is, of course, always a remarkably good choice, but Oregon’s famed Willamette Valley and California’s Sonoma Coast and Andersen Valley offer a robust selection of elegant pinot as well. Despite the wine, this is not an alcoholic brownie by any means. The pinot merely adds some nuance to the flavors, so feel free to serve this at your next dinner party for an exciting dessert.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rose-colored-glass/,Rose-Colored Glass,Alex Frane,"When it comes to a romantic drink, it’s difficult to beat sparkling rosé. Pink bubbles are the epitome of indulgence and romanticism in a glass. And while pouring yourself (or someone else) a glass of bubbly, rose-colored wine is more than acceptable, sometimes it’s fun to make a cocktail with it . But rather than reaching for an expensive bottle of Champagne, try a different kind of bottle: Crémant d’Alsace rosé, as bartender Katie Stipe does with the Rose-Colored Glass. Crémant d’Alsace rosé is a dry, pink sparkling wine from the French region of Alsace, a northeastern region bordering Germany. Its proximity to the eastern country means the French region produces a good amount of German grape varietals like riesling and gewurztraminer. Crémant is a term describing wines made under the same rules of production as Champagne, known as méthode-traditionelle, but in different regions. A key element is allowing the secondary fermentation to happen in the bottle, which gives the wine its telltale bubbles and yeasty notes, often described as brioche-like or biscuit-like. Like every region in France, Alsace has strict laws for what varietals can be used. While most white sparkling wines from the region use pinot blanc, Crémant d’Alsace rosé is limited to being made with 100% pinot noir. You can also find Champagne rosé made with 100% pinot noir, though this is rare. Champagnes are much more likely to be blends that include chardonnay and pinot meunier in addition to pinot noir. Another difference between Crémant d’Alsace and Champagne is the price tag. It’s possible to find bottles of Crémant d’Alsace rosé for under $20, a daunting challenge for a comparable bottle of Champagne. This means Crémant d’Alsace is more suitable for cocktail purposes, as with the Rose-Colored Glass. The Rose-Colored Glass has a similar base as the classic Champagne cocktail , which calls for a plopping a sugar cube into a Champagne flute, dabbing it with bitters and pouring Champagne, or another sparkling wine, over it. But here, the drink is built with more bitters, simple syrup rather than a sugar cube and lemon juice to add brightness and tartness. A coupe steps in for the traditional flute, and to complete the look, the drink is finished with a rose petal garnish. The resulting cocktail is bright and bubbly, aromatic and gently sweet. It’s lovely any time of year, but especially for romantic occasions like anniversaries, Valentine’s Day, and or any random date night.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/romancing-the-stone/,Romancing the Stone,Liquor.com,"The French 75 is a fun and sophisticated classic, and arguably the most popular and famous of all sparkling wine cocktails (even more so than the Champagne Cocktail ). A mixture of either gin or brandy, lemon juice, simple syrup and sparkling wine (preferably Champagne), it’s a drink that lends itself well to variations and tweaks . One such approach to variation is the Romancing the Stone, which comes from bartending professionals Chad Solomon and Christy Pope. This romantic take on the French classic involves apricot brandy and honey, but manages to stay balanced in its sweetness. Rather than cognac—which is the preferred choice for a brandy-based French 75 —Solomon and Pope use Blume Marillen, a specific eau-de-vie made with apricots from the Wachau Valley of Austria. Blume Marillen can be more difficult to find than pear (Poire Williams), apple (pomme) or raspberry (framboise) eaux-de-vie, and you may need to turn to online markets to find it, if your local liquor store doesn’t carry any. What You Need to Know About Eau-De-Vie RELATED ARTICLE While packed with apricot flavor, the eau-de-vie is quite dry, and will not lead to an overly sweet drink, even with the half-ounce of rich honey syrup the recipe calls for. It’s further balanced with lemon juice for acidity and brightness. A single dash of the bright red Peychaud’s bitters adds additional complexity and color to the drink, making it more nuanced and layered. When it comes to the choice of sparkling wine, Champagne is always a good bet. Dry, bready and beautifully effervescent, it pairs lovingly with the apricot brandy. However, not everyone is keen on using the expensive and lauded French wine in a mixed drink—instead, you can always use another sparkling white wine, especially those made with methode traditionnelle, as many French and American wines are. 6 French 75 Twists to Try Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'apricot'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rich honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'flute', 'ingredient': 'sparkling wine'}]","['Add the Blume Marillen apricot eau-de-vie, lemon juice, honey syrup and Peychaud’s bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled Champagne flute.', 'Top with Champagne (or other sparkling white wine).']",0,

But the Cupid’s Champagne Potion ... now that you can handle. The recipe comes from bartender and brand ambassador Claire Smith, who enlists Belvedere vodka to make this drink. The Polish, rye-made spirit is joined by peach puree and then topped with Champagne. It’s easy to make, it looks great in the glass, and it’s just the right amount of fancy.

But, let’s be honest: Sometimes you just want a sweet and satisfying guilty pleasure cocktail . The Peanut Butter Cup is very much that. Made with chocolate vodka, peanut-flavored rum, chocolate liqueur and cream, the Peanut Butter Cup is dessert in a glass. Except, instead of a spoon, this is an after-dinner treat meant for drinking. This cocktail, though it contains many sweet and creamy elements, also features three alcoholic ingredients and is quite boozy. It begins with a full measure of chocolate vodka, a spirit that typically hovers around 35% ABV. The vodka is joined by chocolate liqueur (choose your favorite) and Castries crème peanut rum from St. Lucia. Made with peanuts, rum, vanilla, and a secret blend of spices, this tasty number clocks in at 16% ABV. So, Peanut Butter Cup functions as both dessert and nightcap. Shake everything together with ice and serve in a chocolate-coated glass garnished with a peanut butter cup, and you get a drink that’s rich, sweet and nutty.

https://www.liquor.com/buena-vista-irish-coffee-recipe-5208988,Buena Vista Irish Coffee,Amanda Marsteller,"100 bottles of Irish whiskey and 2,000 Irish Coffees ? That’s a normal day’s yield at San Francisco’s time-honored Buena Vista Cafe . Batched along the bar in a neat line of 28 glass goblets, the cafe pours more Irish whiskey than anyone in the world thanks to its renowned recipe. Paul Nolan has been with Buena Vista for more than 40 years and estimates that he’s poured an astounding five million Irish Coffees. Invented by Irishman Joseph Sheridan in 1942, the original Irish Coffee was developed to soothe and revive the spirit. The recipe made its debut at the Buena Vista in 1952, when owner Jack Koeppler and international travel writer Stanton Delaplane set out to recreate the warming brew after Delaplane enjoyed a glass at Ireland’s Shannon Airport. Decades later, that same recipe graces the bar each day by the thousands. The goblet of choice at Buena Vista is a dainty 6-ounce stemmed glass that’s shaped to show off a snowcap of whipped cream. The tulip shape prevents an oversized pour of coffee and keeps the balance of ingredients intact. Equally important is what happens before any coffee even hits the bottom. Always preheat your glass by filling it with hot water and letting it sit until warm. This keeps the coveted cocktail steaming hot from the get-go. Cold cream and room temperature whiskey can cause this hot drink’s temperature to plunge. To counteract that steep drop, Buena Vista keeps its coffee on the hotter side, while making sure that it stays fresh and doesn’t sit around stewing on the burner. Nolan uses an organic medium-roast Colombian coffee blend, which he finds is a solid middle ground, even for those who claim to hate coffee. Nolan warns against using strong roasts. “The coffee complements the drink but should never stand out,” he says. It’s all about the balance of flavors. The crisp white collar of whipped cream that floats above each glass of Irish Coffee is the most difficult ingredient to perfect. Buena Vista employs heavy whipping cream that’s lightly whipped in an upright blender. According to Nolan, this method ensures “aeration and a slower thickening of the cream,” plus the perfect frothy texture. Buena Vista discovered that cream aged for a few days floats better than fresh-from-the-dairy cream. So let your cream languish for a day or two before whipping. Once you have the right consistency, pour your cream over the back of a warm teaspoon held just above the coffee. Raise the spoon slowly as you pour and watch the perfect Irish Coffee roar to life.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'C&H sugar cubes'}, {'quantity': '4-6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'brewed coffee'}, {'quantity': '1 1/3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Irish whiskey (Nolan recommends Tullamore D.E.W.)'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Heavy cream, lightly whipped'}]","['Preheat a 6-ounce heat-proof glass by filling it with hot water.

https://www.liquor.com/dubliner-cocktail-recipe-5114273,Dubliner,Gary Regan,"The late, great Gary “Gaz” Regan wrote this ode to Irish pubs in 2013. Some of my very favorite joints in New York—Swift, McSorley’s Old Ale House, Mustang Sally’s—are Irish pubs. Don’t get me wrong; I love hanging at speakeasies and swank cocktail bars, too. But if you ask around, you’ll hear that I often leave my Negroni on the bar to go find a pint of Guinness and a shot of Jameson when I’m on a cocktail crawl. You know you’re in a good Irish pub when nobody at the bar is talking on a cell phone, the bartender actually has a genuine smile on his or her face, and it takes at least 10 minutes to get a pint of Guinness because the bartender isn’t happy with it until it’s perfect. Which is why I couldn’t resist working a few shifts at The Dead Rabbit, Manhattan’s greatest addition to the Irish pub category. (It’s the first regular bartending gig I’d had since I held forth at Painter’s Tavern in the Hudson Valley from 2004 to 2006.) The establishment’s managers, Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry, knew to put me behind the bar in their ground-floor saloon rather than in their second-floor cocktail lounge. It’s where I belong. Irish bars are all about craic—Gaelic for banter, chit-chat, conversation, chin-wagging—so I won’t be trying to wow the punters by telling them when and how vermouth came into vogue in the U.S., changing the face of the cocktail scene forever (late-19th century, making the creation of the Manhattan and the Martini possible). That’s not the sort of thing that pub customers want to hear. In an Irish pub, it’s a case of who can spin the best tale, not “my gin’s drier than your gin.” It’s a case of craic over cocktails. And it’s not about mixing fine drinks either. In an Irish pub, it’s all about a decent pint, tasty whiskey and engaging conversation. The bartender might be able to fix you a delicious Dubliner cocktail (a citrusy take on the Manhattan), and there’s a good chance that he or she will guide you toward a dram of something special that will knock your socks off, but that’s not really the point. Community, camaraderie and craic—that’s what an Irish pub is about.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/irish-coffee-2/,Irish Coffee,Liquor.com,"The Irish Coffee may not be the first coffee drink with alcohol, but this cocktail has become one of the most famous. Combining coffee with Irish whiskey, brown sugar and lightly whipped cream, the Irish Coffee is a hot, creamy classic that can wake you up on cold mornings or keep you going after a long night. There are many tall tales about the Irish Coffee’s origins. The most credible version attributes the cocktail to Joe Sheridan, the head chef of the restaurant at the Foynes Flying Boat terminal in County Limerick in the early 1940s, who wanted to add a little local hospitality to the establishment’s coffee. Legend has it that when he first served it and was asked if it was Brazilian coffee, Sheridan cheekily replied that it was “Irish coffee.” The drink was later made famous by Pulitzer Prize-winning ""San Francisco Chronicle"" columnist Stanton Delaplane, who frequented the Buena Vista Cafe in San Francisco during the 1950s. After tasting one in Ireland, he and the bar’s owner, Jack Koeppler, attempted to recreate the warming elixir. They succeeded, and Delaplane wrote about the drink in his column, which was read widely across the States. This helped to earn the drink a following at Buena Vista and beyond. On a busy day, the San Francisco bar can serve more than 2,000 Irish Coffees. With its comforting blend of whiskey, caffeine and cream, it’s easy to see the drink’s appeal. According to bartending legend Dale DeGroff, the Irish Coffee should not be a large drink. He says that bars, particularly in America, go too big, which ruins the balance of an otherwise great cocktail. ""Choose the vessel wisely,"" he says. ""The small bell-shaped glass that Libbey has been providing to The Buena Vista for decades is a nice size at six ounces."" Then you can build your drink right in the glass, starting with the whiskey, sugar and coffee, and topping it with a dose of thick cream. ""At The Buena Vista Cafe, the concoction is finished with a white cloud of hand-whipped cream,"" says DeGroff. ""This topping serves two important purposes: It creates the drink’s signature dramatic black-and-white look, and the unsweetened coolness of the cream tempers the alcohol and the hot, sugary coffee."" If you’d like to decorate that gorgeous white head, you can optionally add a dusting of fresh cinnamon or nutmeg for a fragrant garnish. ""You also don’t need a giant pour of Irish whiskey,"" says DeGroff. ""Delaplane and Koeppler’s recipe calls for a one-ounce shot. I know it seems stingy, but do not be put off—it’s actually good news. That liquor, along with three-and-a-half ounces of steaming-hot sweetened coffee and three-quarters of an inch of lightly whipped cream, is so delicious you’ll want to consume at least two more."" Liquor.com’s recipe below calls for slightly more than that, but it's still not enough to knock you off your bar stool. Degroff offers three additional tips for creating a perfect Irish Coffee: 1. Use a stemmed glass no larger than eight ounces. (With an eight-ounce glass, you can go up to one-and-a-half ounces of Irish whiskey. I am partial to Jameson.) 2. Top with no more than four ounces of steaming-hot sweetened coffee. 3. Lightly whip the cream. It should not form peaks, but it should be frothy enough to float, creating that perfect separation of coffee from cream, which is, after all, the signature of the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/shamrock-shot/,Shamrock Shot,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to think of another holiday with as many associated drinks as St. Patrick’s Day has . The Irish Coffee and the Irish Shot , along with dyed green beer, are the most well-known of this questionable category, but there are many others. For some revelers, there are two rules to fixing a St. Patrick’s Day drink: It should be green and it should be shootable. The Shamrock Shot, a festive, minty chocolate shot, checks both boxes. Does it have anything to do with the patron saint of Ireland? Of course it doesn’t. When making any kind of sweet green shot, the obvious move is to go with creme de menthe , which is exactly what this drink calls for. While you could use another vodka, vanilla vodka is going to taste the way the drink looks—like a sweet, rich dessert. Chocolate bitters enhance the dessert-quality of the drink, but also give it much-needed depth. Because the Shamrock Shot is so sweet and creamy, it’s important to get it as cold as possible. To this end, you’ll want to throw the empty shot glasses into the freezer for twenty to thirty minutes prior to filling them with the creamy green concoction and topping them with whipped cream. And if you want to make the drink even more appropriate for the holiday, considering hitting the whipped cream with some green food dye or, better idea, infusing the cream with creme de menthe.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/frisky-whiskey/,Frisky Whiskey,Liquor.com,"St. Patrick’s Day is arguably the most famous drinking holiday, at least in the United States, and there are more than a few cocktails that celebrate it. There’s the Irish Shot , Irish Coffee and the Tipperary , for starts. But you don’t need the excuse of an over-indulgent holiday to mix an Irish whiskey cocktail . Though this spirit family is less commonly used in drinks than its American counterparts like bourbon and rye, the wide-ranging world of Irish whiskey lends itself well to cocktail bartending. One such drink that serves as a fun St. Patrick’s Day libation as well as a pleasing year-round beverage is the Frisky Whiskey. This Irish whiskey cocktail comes from Allen Katz, an experienced bartender and co-founder of the New York Distilling Company. The Frisky Whiskey features a number of unconventional ingredients, namely Irish whiskey, honey liqueur and orange juice rather than the more typical lemon or lime juice. This Irish sour is further sweetened with simple syrup and gets botanicals and depth from Angostura bitters. Katz does not specify a brand of Irish whiskey. There are plenty of stellar options out there, from the more familiar like Jameson and Powers to a suite of new expressions and brands . As the whiskey is mixed with other potent ingredients, including orange juice and honey liqueur, its flavor will be muffled. So it’s best to save the top-shelf labels for sipping on their own or for use in an Irish Old Fashioned . For the honey liqueur, Katz calls for Bärenjäger. This German honey liqueur is related to Jägermeister in name only: Jäger is “hunter” in German, and the honey liqueur’s name translates to “bear hunter.” Made with real honey, it also goes into drinks like the Bee Sting . Being that this is an Irish cocktail, a honey liqueur like Celtic Honey, made entirely with Irish ingredients, would be an appropriate substitute. If using that or another alternative, be sure to taste for sweetness and adjust accordingly before serving. You may find that you don’t need the simple syrup, or that you need more than is called for, depending on the sweetness of the honey liqueur (and orange juice). 20 Irish Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Bärenjäger honey liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}]","['Add the Irish whiskey, Bärenjäger, orange juice, simple syrup and Angostura bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.']",71,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-dead-rabbit-irish-coffee/,The Dead Rabbit Irish Coffee,Liquor.com,"Along with the Hot Toddy , the Irish Coffee is one of the most famous and beloved hot cocktails. And while it can be found at bars and pubs across the world, the one at New York City’s famed Irish bar The Dead Rabbit is especially celebrated. We reached out to beverage director Aidan Bowie for his secret to this celebrated classic, so you can make it yourself at home. As a fairly simple cocktail consisting of four main parts, the quality of ingredients is paramount. There are many Irish whiskeys to choose from, but you’ll want one that’s rich enough to stand up to the coffee and cream, while remaining mellow and smooth enough to not be overpowering. For this recipe, Bowie opts for Bushmills Original Irish Whiskey, which fulfills these criteria while offering a respectable quality-to-affordability ratio. Naturally, the choice of coffee is also important, and personal preference can come into play here. In general, you’ll want one that is bold, smooth, and assertive without being overly chocolatey or fruity. Since coffee roasting and distribution can vary city by city and town by town, Bowie doesn’t specify a particular brand, though his team is currently working with Ireland-based Calendar Coffee for its version. But have fun pairing different roasts and brands with the whiskey to find what works best for you. For the rest of the recipe, there are only some minor differences from a standard Irish Coffee recipe . The bar uses a rich (two-parts sugar to one-part water) syrup made with demerara sugar, which is a raw sugar extracted from sugar cane that naturally contains molasses. Its flavor and color is somewhere between brown and white sugar, and it adds depth and nuance that regular simple syrup does not. The other difference is that rather than whipped cream, the bar uses unsweetened heavy cream, whipped until it’s frothy, allowing it to rest comfortably atop of the drink without sinking. This gives a sturdy platform on which to optionally grate fresh nutmeg, and the cream will slowly incorporate as you sip your drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/irish-buck/,Irish Buck,Liquor.com,"There’s something refreshing, both literally and figuratively, about the simplicity of a highball, whether it’s the bracing bitterness of a Gin & Tonic or the warm spice of a Ginger Ale Highball . But if you add a little squirt of citrus to the latter, it transforms into a buck. Technically, a buck is any mix of ginger ale (or ginger beer), citrus juice and a spirit. The Dark ’n Stormy is a famous variation, one that’s popular enough that it has its own name—normally, a buck is simply named after whatever spirit goes into it. The Irish Buck, then, is a mix of Irish whiskey, ginger ale and lime juice, served in a tall glass over ice. The category dates back to the late 19th century, and it’s believed to have been a bit of a play on words. A glass of ginger ale was referred to as a Horse’s Neck—add a measure of liquor and it gives it a kick, or a “buck.” The recipe‘s simplicity gives it room for experimentation. Even with something as simple as the Irish Buck, you have a multitude of options, starting with the choice of whiskey. Do you use one that is approachable and affordable, like Jameson or Bushmills, or do you splurge and throw in a single malt or small batch whiskey? The other element to contend with is the choice between ginger beer and ginger ale. At one time, the majority of store-bought ginger ales were artificial and cloyingly sweet—nowadays there are plenty of options for good quality ginger ales. Ginger beer, which is naturally fermented with ginger, is usually going to pack a spicier punch, and is often a bit less sweet. With the Irish Buck, it’s up to personal taste which one you use. Finally, the recipe calls for a quarter-ounce of lime juice, but the Irish Buck is a forgiving highball. It’s perfectly acceptable to squeeze a quartered lime (or even a lemon, which goes nicely with whiskey) over the drink and then drop it in. But be sure to avoid seeds—no one wants to suck a seed up through their straw when enjoying a beverage.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pot-of-gold/,Pot of Gold,Liquor.com,"St. Patrick’s Day is always a good excuse to have a drink, and there are a number of themed cocktails for the holiday beyond cheap beers dyed green: The Irish Shot and the Irish Coffee , along with its many variations , are two of the best known. But those who want a drink that’s a little sweet, a bit tart and a touch smokey should consider the Pot of Gold, a foamy egg white sour garnished with treasure from the end of the rainbow. As the Pot of Gold celebrates Ireland’s most famed drinking holiday, the drink starts with Irish whiskey. You can use a reliable brand like Jameson, Powers or Bushmills, or splurge a little and pick a bottle like Knappogue Castle 12 Year or one of the expressions from Teeling. However, it’s wise not to go too big, as the whiskey will be mixed with lemon juice and a ginger honey syrup. Reserve the top-shelf bottles for drinking on their own. Even though this is an Irish drink for an Irish holiday, the whiskey base is bolstered with a quarter ounce of smoky scotch from Islay, one of Scotland’s most peat-heavy whisky regions . The relatively small amount means the peaty scotch won’t overwhelm the drink, but it will lend a deep, smokey and complex nuance, and you can use whatever Islay whisky you have on hand. Rather than the traditional simple syrup used in most Whiskey Sours , this drink takes a honey ginger syrup, which gives it a subtle kick of gingery spice and a smooth mouthfeel. That silkiness is amplified by egg white; though those who avoid egg can substitute an ounce of aquafaba, the liquid from canned chickpeas. It’s important to include a foaming element like one of those two, as it provides a pillowy cushion on which to rest the drink’s most stunning feature, a few flakes of edible gold. Luckily, you won’t need to hunt down a leprechaun for this, as you can find edible gold flakes at baking stores or buy them online.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/irish-blonde/,Irish Blonde,Liquor.com,"Normally, when people think of St. Patrick’s Day cocktails , their minds go to Irish Coffees , Irish Shots or simply an Irish whiskey served neat. But for those who want a more interesting and unique way to celebrate the holiday, or for any occasion calling for Irish whiskey , there’s the Irish Blonde. This cocktail comes from bar legend and author Dale DeGroff , AKA King Cocktail. The Irish Blonde combines Irish whiskey with orange liqueur and sherry for a rich and luxurious drink. The base of the Irish Blonde is Michael Collins Irish whiskey, a blended Irish whiskey that normally carries a reasonable price tag between $20 and $30 a bottle. It’s elegant and refined but stands up well in mixed drinks. Then, orange curaçao adds sweetness, richness and a smooth mouthfeel. You can substitute another triple sec like Grand Marnier or Cointreau . Curaçao tends to be darker and sweeter, so adjust accordingly if using another product. In any case, the orange of the liqueur is amplified with a bit of orange bitters: DeGroff uses the classic Regan’s Orange Bitters, but Angostura Orange or another one will do fine. Sherry adds remarkable depth to almost any kind of cocktail, even when used sparingly, as it is used in the Irish Blonde. The drink gets only a quarter ounce of fino sherry, a light, bright and bone-dry style with elements that are almost savory. Though its flavor in the drink is understated, the sherry is crucial for the overall balance and flavor profile. The drink is best finished with a flamed orange peel over the top, adding a spritz of caramelized oils. The end result is an elegant and golden cocktail with silky body and gentle sweetness. It’s a lovely alternative to other St. Patrick’s Day drinks, so much so that you might find yourself enjoying it all year round, not only on the Irish holiday. 20 Cocktails to Make for St. Patrick’s Day RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sherry'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the blended Irish whiskey, orange curaçao, fino sherry and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a flamed orange peel.']",22,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/banana-daiquiri/,Banana Daiquiri,Liquor.com,"The Banana Daiquiri means different things to different people. To some, it’s an ice-cold blender drink beloved as much for its fruitiness as its frothiness—one unleashed on sunny beach vacations featuring umbrellas and clear blue water. To others, it’s a fun riff on the classic shaken Daiquiri , accented with a hint of banana. Both parties are correct, but this recipe belongs to the latter camp. Fun fact: You don’t need a banana to make a Banana Daiquiri. Instead, you can enlist a good banana liqueur to add the sweet fruity quality that turns this drink into a tropical favorite. There are several banana liqueurs on the market, and they vary wildly in quality. Tempus Fugit crème de banane liqueur is a great choice, if you can find it. Otherwise, aim for an option that limits the artificial ingredients. To get the most out of your Banana Daiquiri, try a few different rums, as the range in styles and flavors will affect the sweetness and balance of the cocktail. Aged rums tend to amplify the oak-induced flavors like vanilla and caramel, while dry unaged rums typically highlight grassier and fruitier notes. Pair that rum with fresh lime juice, because fresh is the best. And, although simple syrup works fine, demerara syrup—which is made from a type of raw cane sugar—brings notes of toffee and molasses. This recipe keeps it simple with shaker tins, but if you do want to employ your blender, combine the ingredients with a handful of ice (be careful not to over-dilute the drink) and a banana. Then give everything a whir until you’re presented with a creamy frozen treat. Both options will taste great, cool you down and conjure feelings of a tropical getaway. Clear Your Mind.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/daiquiri/,Daiquiri,Dylan Garret,"Long before it became an umbrella category for a massive number of variations and riffs, the three ingredient Daiquiri—a combination of rum, lime juice, and sugar—was a pioneer of the sour category of drinks. In David A. Embury’s highly influential 1948 book The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , it’s listed as one of the six essential cocktails to know, alongside the Martini, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, Jack Rose, and Sidecar. Perhaps one of the most well-known rum cocktails ever created, the Daiquiri has gone through ups and downs over its 100+ year history. Here’s everything you need to know about this iconic drink, and how to mix it right. The Origins of the Daiquiri The modern Daiquiri is thought by many to have been invented around 1898 in a mining village situated near beach of the same name on the southeastern tip of Cuba, just east of the city of Santiago de Cuba. One popular telling credits the Daiquiri’s creation to an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox, and a U.S. Navy medical officer who brought Cox’s recipe from Cuba to Washington, D.C., popularizing it stateside. However, given the drink’s simple combination of three staple ingredients of the Caribbean, it’s likely similar combinations predate this story. Grog , a drink favored by British sailors that involved watered-down rum rations which were often combined with lime and sugar to create a palatable way to combat scurvy, predate Cox’s creations by at least 150 years. How to Make Navy Grog RELATED ARTICLE What the more modern Daiquiri had that these earlier grog-adjacent drinks didn’t was ice. Refrigeration advancements in the 1800s allowed for the production of artificial ice in any environment, eventually at low cost, and this began to take the place of the plain water that was previously used to dilute alcoholic drinks. Fittingly, the evolution of the Daiquiri over the next hundred years would often be tied to the ice used in its preparation, from early iterations that were stirred using cracked ice in highball glasses, to those that were served on the rocks, shaken with ice and served up, or famously, the iconic blended Frozen Daiquiris of later eras. In the years since its creation, the Daiquiri has become one of the most famous cocktails created, garnering passionate fans that include household names like Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy. Though the period of the 1980s and ’90s saw the rise of countless blended sugar-bombs that bore the drink’s name but few other similarities, modern bartenders and consumers have since re-embraced the simplicity and perfection of the three-ingredient original. “[The Daiquiri] is, in my opinion, a vastly superior cocktail to the Manhattan, yet more bars sell more Manhattans than Daiquiris. So far as I can ascertain, there are two reasons why more Daiquiris are not sold: the use of inferior rums and the use of improper proportions.” —David Embury, The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks Why the Daiquiri Works In its purest form, the Daiquiri is a delicate balance of rum, fresh lime juice, and sugar. This trinity of ingredients form the basis of the sour category of drinks, which includes other iconic drinks like the Whiskey Sour, Margarita, Sidecar, Gimlet, and countless more. In The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks , Embury even states, after describing the recipe for a Gin Sour, “Now, supposing that we specify lime juice and white Cuban rum, does this recipe sound familiar? Right! The famous Daiquiri.” When made correctly, you’ve got a drink that is still dry, drinks smoothly, and doesn’t allow any one of the three base elements overpower the other. The key to the Daiquiri comes in finding the right balance. An overly sweet rum will throw your ratio of sugar off and leave you sipping liquid candy. Overdo the citrus, and the cocktail drowns in a puckering pool of heartburn-inducing acidity. But most important of all is to recognize how individual tastes differ, and tailor your ratios accordingly to the person that will be drinking it. This Daiquiri recipe walks the knife edge with a mix of light rum and a darker demerara sugar syrup. The two accentuate the best qualities in each other, with demerara allowing the cocktail a bit of depth, while taking the bite off the rum and fresh lime juice. High quality rum is a must, as there aren’t many ingredients here that will cover for a subpar spirit. One trick we recommended when juicing the limes: Use a hand-squeezer (or your own hands). The oils from the rind add an extra flash of intensity that gives the cocktail a nice, bright edge, and increased aromatics.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bloody-caesar/,Bloody Caesar,David Wondrich,"In 1969, the owners of the Calgary Inn in Calgary, Alberta, asked Walter Chell, the Montenegrin who presided over their Owl’s Nest bar, to create a recipe to represent their new Italian restaurant in a contest. So Chell took some vodka, a bit of Worcestershire and a little Tabasco, added a mix of clam and tomato juices and dubbed it the “Bloody Caesar.” It sounds rather odd, but it’s the national drink of Canada and has been so practically since Chell invented—or should I say “invented”—it. There are two ways to be the creator of a cocktail. You can be the undisputed first person ever to put a certain set of ingredients together in a glass. There is much honor in that, to be sure, though there is rarely much fame. Or you can take a pre-existing combination of ingredients and give it a catchy new name and backstory. You then proceed to sell it like crazy, and if you’re good, your creation suddenly catches on. This might not be particularly honorable (although that’s open to debate), but it’s plenty of fun—and sometimes you end up famous. Jerry Thomas , founding father of the American bar, was that second type of mixologist. He took the Tom & Jerry , an obscure New England concoction that had been around since before he was born, and made it his own, riding it into the pages of history. Which kind of inventor was Chell? Chell was a hell of a bartender, there’s no doubt about that. But as far back as 1953, Walter Winchell was writing about a Smirnoff Smiler, which called for vodka, clam juice, tomato juice and Worcestershire sauce. And in 1968, Clamato (that’s the duo of clam and tomato juices) was pushing a Clam Digger, which is basically the same drink without the spices. But nobody asks for Clam Diggers or Smirnoff Smilers these days. It’s one thing to mix a drink; it’s another to get people to order it. Chell got a whole country to do that.

In that wide canon you’ll find classics like the Sidecar, Pisco Sour and plenty more, plus modern-classics and contemporary creations that follow suit and join the sour party. To that end, meet the Forbidden Sour, a tasty combination of bourbon, lemon juice and simple syrup that is accented by the unmistakable flavor of pomegranate. The drink comes from bartending veteran and beverage consultant Eben Freeman, who has worked behind the stick and created menus for restaurants and bars in New York and around the globe. Despite the name, there’s nothing verboten about this cocktail—it’s actually quite accessible. But the bright-red pomegranate, not an apple, is considered by some to be the original forbidden fruit that tempted Adam and Eve. Hence: the Forbidden Sour. Freeman’s drink builds on the classic Whiskey Sour formula (bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and optional egg white), but it intensifies that template with Pama, a unique pomegranate liqueur made from pomegranate juice, vodka and a touch of tequila. At only 17% ABV, Pama blends easily with a variety of spirits. In this cocktail, it lends complexity to the drink with its sweet-tart taste and vibrant ruby-red color.

While a traditional Negroni combines equal parts gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, this lighter variation swaps the gin for prosecco or another sparkling wine. Many home bartenders started memorizing the specs in 2022, after House of Dragons stars Emma D’Arcy and Olivia Cooke drew attention to the drink in a viral TikTok . However, the bittersweet aperitivo was invented decades earlier at Milan, Italy’s famed Bar Basso, by its late bartender and proprietor Mirko Stochetto. Despite the drink’s name, its inception in 1967 wasn’t really a mistake, according to Stochetto’s son Maurizio , who runs the bar today. A customer ordered a Negroni, and when Stochetto realized he had grabbed a bottle of prosecco instead of gin, he didn’t return it to the back bar. “It occurred to him that the combination made some sense,” recalls the younger Stochetto. “And so he poured the sparkling wine saying, ‘Oh, today, it’s a sunny day, so let’s get something smoother.’ ” On the alcohol spectrum, the Negroni Sbagliato sits somewhere in between the Americano —made with soda water instead of gin—and a full-proof Negroni.

Before your mind wanders to grooming habits, the explanation is quite simple: Fuzzy refers to the peach schnapps (think peach fuzz) and the navel refers to the type of orange. The easygoing two-parter enjoyed its heyday in the 1980s, an era known for its fun although not particularly well-respected cocktails. When DeKuyper released its peach schnapps into the American market in 1984, bartenders had yet another sweet, friendly ingredient to employ. That’s around the time that New Jersey bartender and “Bartending for Dummies” author Ray Foley got his hands on a bottle. Foley mixed equal-parts peach schnapps and orange juice together, creating a fruity highball that packed less of a punch than the Screwdriver (vodka and orange juice). The drink soon solidified its place in every bartender’s repertoire, and it also propelled DeKuyper’s Peachtree Schnapps to become one of the country’s best-selling spirits. The drink is regularly made with bottled orange juice, which makes a decent cocktail if that’s all you have. But try squeezing your own. Fresh OJ takes the drink to new heights, complementing the fruity liqueur with a richer, more citrusy taste. After all, your brunches deserve nothing but the best.

At its best, the drink is a refreshing, delicious concoction that highlights good rum , sweet strawberries and fresh lime juice. But during the 1980s and ’90s—the heyday of artificial mixers—the Strawberry Daiquiri’s reputation suffered a hit, as bars served neon-colored cocktails that were absent any actual strawberries. When made with care and fresh ingredients, however, the drink is a revelation. The Strawberry Daiquiri is often served frozen. Rum, lime, simple syrup and several strawberries are combined with ice and blended until smooth. This icy treat provides the invigorating profile of a fresh smoothie, with the added bonus of alcohol. The strawberry-based variation is the most famous of the flavored, blended Daiquiris—a category that also includes popular versions that range from banana to mango, to countless other fruit combinations. But despite it's often unearned reputation as an unserious drink, when made properly, the balance of fresh ingredients that make a classic Daiquiri work, are also at play in its frozen variation.

As easy as pre-mixed commercial products may be, they can’t come close to matching the taste of real fruit. However, frozen whole strawberries can be substituted when fresh strawberries are unavailable. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog What Type of Rum to Use in a Strawberry Daiquiri Many different types of rum can work in this drink, and each will offer unique flavors. Consider choosing a rum that will complement the fresh fruit without overpowering it. Silver rums will tend to allow the fruit to display more prominently. However, there’s not one right answer, so for the best results, choose a rum you like or experiment with unfamiliar brands to find a new favorite. How to Make a Strawberry Daiquiri Without a Blender If you prefer your Strawberry Daiquiri shaken or you don’t have a blender, not to worry. You can first muddle the strawberries with simple syrup in a cocktail shaker and then shake everything with ice before fine-straining the contents into your glass to avoid any solid bits and seeds. The texture won’t contain that trademark icy bite with each sip, but the flavor will be equally delicious. For a shaken daiquiri, adjust the recipe below to include 2 ounces of rum, 1 ounce of lime juice and 3/4 ounce of rich simple syrup. 22 Frozen Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '4–5', 'unit': 'large', 'ingredient': 'strawberries'}, {'quantity': '1 cup', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'ice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible orchid', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine the rum, rich simple syrup, lime juice, strawberries and ice in a blender and blend until smooth.', 'Pour into a hurricane style glass or wine glass.', 'Garnish with an optional edible orchid.']",76,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/darkside/,Dark Side,Liquor.com,"The Dark Side cocktail was created by Washington, D.C., bartender Adam Bernbach at now-closed Bar Pilar. It features gin and Barolo chinato, an aromatized wine similar to vermouth that includes quinine bark, the same ingredient found in tonic that gives tonic a bitter edge. Peychaud’s bitters brings it all home with its trademark hint of anise. In addition to making a lot of local drinkers happy, the DarkSide was also included in Derek Brown’s book “ Spirits, Sugar, Water, Bitters: How the Cocktail Conquered the World .” According to Brown, Bernbach ran a unique program called Cocktail Sessions. “Guests could cozy up to the bar and order a cocktail tasting where Adam would fix three original cocktails using twists on classics,” he says. That’s where the Dark Side made its first appearance. Bernbach’s recipe confirms that drinks don’t need more than three ingredients to be delicious, but as it became more popular, the Dark Side changed tack a few times. Certain iterations featured Plymouth gin, while others called for London dry. You may find the cocktail garnished with a lime twist and star anise pod, while other recipes, including this one, call for a cherry. Whichever route you go, the Dark Side is rich, moody and complex. The chinato’s bittersweet character and baking-spice notes merge seamlessly with the botanical gin and yield a drink that is reminiscent of the classic Martinez but with a quality all its own. The modern-classic is a nod to D.C.’s influence on drinking culture and a reminder that the East Coast has more than one influential cocktail city.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rosemary-mezcal-negroni/,Rosemary Mezcal Negroni,Liquor.com,"The Negroni was stirred to life in the early 20th century, but it wasn’t until the early 21st century that seemingly every bartender with a mixing glass and bar spoon began to create their own version of the classic cocktail. With its holy trinity of ingredients—gin, sweet vermouth, Campari—the Negroni has become the Mr. Potato Head of drinks. Creative barkeeps mix and match the spirit, vermouth (or other aromatized wine or aperitif) and bitter liqueur to create a fun and original drink that still checks all the right boxes. This version is essentially a Mezcal Negroni , but with a detour. It calls for a touch more mezcal than the typical equal-parts formula, giving the drink an extra earthy and savory quality. Most interesting of all, it employs rosemary-infused Campari to lend the drink an aromatic and herbaceous backbone. The infused Campari is easy to make at home or behind the bar and simply requires Campari, a few rosemary sprigs and a 24-hour nap in a Mason jar. If you want a Rosemary Mezcal Negroni, you’d better think ahead. But once you make the infusion, you’ll have a batch on hand to dose your next many drinks. The Rosemary Mezcal Negroni is a decent leap from the classic gin-based cocktail, but it still hits the notes you’re looking for in a good Negroni: It’s potent, refreshingly bitter and well-balanced. Dial up its herbal character and smoke even more with a flamed rosemary garnish, which is optional but highly recommended.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/trinidad-sour/,Trinidad Sour,Liquor.com,"Some drinks look strange on paper. If you’ve ever mixed even a single Manhattan or an Old Fashioned, you’re familiar with the dark, potent powers of Angostura bitters. Most cocktails that call for the ingredient use only a dash or two to add some complexity and bolster flavors, essentially like finishing a dish with salt and pepper. Using an entire ounce and a half of the highly aromatic bitters as the base of the cocktail is almost unheard of. But that’s what’s called for in the Trinidad Sour, a drink from Las Vegas bartender Giuseppe González. Angostura bitters clock in around 45% alcohol, so using it as the base of the cocktail is similar to using a whiskey or rum in terms of alcohol level and potency. The big difference is the intense, bold botanicals of the bitters, the exact recipe of which is a closely guarded secret. There’s not really a comparable spirit. While some of the more botanical-heavy, bittersweet amari would be closest, they usually lack the high proof and the intensity. The bitters are bolstered with a half-ounce of rye whiskey to lend additional spice and structure—whichever rye you prefer for your Manhattan or Sazerac will fit here nicely. For sweetness, the drink gets an ounce of orgeat rather than the more familiar simple syrup. This nut-based syrup can sometimes be hard to find on store shelves, but brands like BG Reynolds, Liber & Co. and even Torani sell bottles of it online. If you want, you can always have a go at making your own orgeat. Along with the orgeat, lemon juice helps balance the herbal intensity of the bitters. All together it makes the Trinidad Sour a rich, singular delight.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orgeat'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Angostura bitters, rye whiskey, lemon juice and orgeat into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",87,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/picon-punch/,Picon Punch,Liquor.com,"The Picon Punch is a 19th-century cocktail featuring a unique liqueur called Amer Picon , plus grenadine, brandy and sparkling water. The liqueur dates back to 1837, when it was created by Gaëtan Picon as a medicinal tonic. While enlisted in the French army and stationed in Algeria, he collected local herbs including quinine, cinchona and gentian to make the original 78-proof Amer Picon liqueur. Picon went on to open a distillery in Marseille, France, and his namesake spirit eventually found its way to Bakersfield, California, where it was mixed regularly into drinks like the Picon Punch for the local Basque population. Today, the Picon Punch is a common serve among the vibrant Basque community in Reno. Despite its lengthy history and current niche popularity, the Picon Punch is rarely served in the U.S. today as it was originally intended. That’s because Amer Picon is no longer commercially available in the country, so the cocktail is typically made with other liqueurs that mirror the original. To make their Picon Punch, the innovative bar team at San Francisco’s 15 Romolo substitute a blend of Italian amari and liqueurs to fill in for the Amer Picon’s intense herbal character, using two parts Ramazzotti, two parts dry curaçao and one part gentian liqueur. The combination approximates Amer Picon’s unique flavor profile of bittersweet orange, gentian and dry quinine. Their version also calls for homemade grenadine for a better, richer flavor than the bright-red bottles you find on store shelves.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/americano/,Americano,Kevin Gray,"James Bond’s impact on drinking culture cannot be overstated, from his Martinis (shaken, not stirred) to the Vesper . But the Americano is Bond’s first drink order in “Casino Royale,” the 1953 book by Ian Fleming that kicked off the series, and the cocktail again makes an appearance in later novels. The man was onto something, but the cocktail predates Bond by nearly a century. The Americano was first served in the 1860s at Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan, Italy. The drink, which features Campari and sweet vermouth in equal parts topped with sparkling water, is an effortless take on the Milano-Torino, which contained Campari and sweet vermouth, sans water. It’s believed that the name stems from its popularity among American tourists. And it’s possible that the name wasn’t affixed until the Prohibition era, when Americans absconded to Europe in droves, thirsty for good drinks. The Americano is also thought to be the precursor to the Negroni . As the story goes, the Negroni was invented in Florence by the Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century, when he asked a barkeep to tweak his Americano by replacing the soda water with gin. Since the cocktail has only three ingredients, it’s important that each component be of the highest quality. Campari takes care of itself. The Italian aperitif is made from a proprietary infusion of herbs and fruit in alcohol, and it gives everything it touches a red-tinged punch of bitterness. You can choose your favorite sweet vermouth, but it’s imperative that the vermouth is fresh: It should be stored in the fridge, and it will begin to change flavor within a month of opening the bottle. All that’s left now is the water. A good soda water or sparkling mineral water with plenty of bite will cut through the bitter Campari and rich vermouth, rendering the drink refreshing and thirst-quenching. With its low-alcohol nature and easy-drinking sensibilities, the Americano is a prime candidate for daytime and preprandial activities. It’s light—but flavorful—and with its bittersweet, bubbly taste, it’s easy to see why counts and spies alike were fans of the classic drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bicicletta/,Bicicletta,Kevin Gray,"Italy has given us so many treasures. Sure, it’s responsible for incredible art, architecture and music. And no one can deny the importance of pasta, one of life’s true pleasures. But we speak of cocktails—specifically the aperitivo, a light, low-ABV drink that stimulates the appetite, fosters conversation and helps you pass the time before dinner. Italy’s well-known aperitivos include the Americano , Aperol Spritz and Negroni , but one often-overlooked example is the Bicicletta, a simple three-part cocktail that combines dry white wine with Campari and sparkling water. Yes, that’s it. Mixing the drink is as easy as riding a bike. The Bicicletta is similar to the Aperol Spritz, which contains Aperol, prosecco and sparkling water. The Bicicletta provides more of a bitter bite due to the Campari, and it receives its effervescence solely from the club soda. If you like one of the two drinks, you’re nearly assured to enjoy the other. When making the Bicicletta, enlist a dry white wine that you’d drink even outside of a cocktail, such as a pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc. It doesn’t need to be expensive, but considering that you’re using three full ounces, you want it to be good. Throw in a couple orange slices for a flavorful garnish, and you’re all set. Sip the Bicicletta on a sun-drenched patio in Italy, or make it at home and pretend you’re on a sun-drenched patio in Italy. Drinking a good cocktail really helps to sell it.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/boulevardier/,Boulevardier,Liquor.com,"Loosely translated, a boulevardier is a man-about-town. A cocktail by the same name was created by Erskine Gwynne, the publisher of “Boulevardier,” a magazine for expats living in Paris during the 1920s. The drink was popularized after it was included in Harry MacElhone’s 1927 book “Barflies and Cocktails.” In it, the author credited the cocktail to Gwynne, a regular at MacElhone’s bar. It’s a tidy story, like the drink it inspired. Employing whiskey, sweet vermouth and Campari, the Boulevardier is simply a variation on the classic Negroni that is adored for its deft balance of bitter, boozy and sweet. The difference in flavor, however, is anything but simple. While the gin-based Negroni is crisp and bracing, the whiskey-based Boulevardier is rich and warming. It’s the exact drink you want to reach for on a chilly fall or winter evening. When making the Boulevardier, choose your ingredients wisely. The best examples hinge on a happy marriage between the base spirit and the sweet vermouth. Now’s not the time to be cheap with either, as both play integral roles in balancing the flavor and weight of the cocktail. Most recipes utilize bourbon, though some people prefer the spicier quality of rye whiskey . Both have their charms, but today you’re most likely to find the Boulevardier made with bourbon. While the Negroni calls for its ingredients in equal parts, this recipe (like many others) features the whiskey in a slightly higher proportion, allowing it to cut through the bitter Campari and the rich, herbal vermouth. Stir them all together with ice, garnish with an orange twist, and take yourself back to 1920s Paris.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-revolver/,Revolver,Liquor.com,"The Revolver is a caffeinated twist on the classic Manhattan that was created by San Francisco bartender Jon Santer in the early 2000s. It first appeared at Bruno’s before Santer took the drink with him to Bourbon & Branch, the acclaimed cocktail bar. The original Revolver was locked and loaded with the spicy bite of rye-heavy Bulleit bourbon, which was new on the scene then. The drink can be recreated with any good bourbon , but if you want to stick true to the original, you can’t go wrong with Bulleit. Rather than reaching for a bottle of sweet vermouth, à la the Manhattan, Santer employs a slug of coffee liqueur to give the cocktail depth and a hint of sweetness. A couple dashes of orange bitters round the drink’s edges, lending subtle brightness to that dark and mysterious duo. The three-ingredient Revolver is simple to execute and should appeal to fans of classic whiskey cocktails and coffee-laced drinks—but the drink receives an additional flourish with its flamed orange peel garnish. This method adds warm, fiery notes of citrus oil to the cocktail and can be achieved without having any pyrotechnic expertise. To make it happen, strike a match and hold it near the drink’s surface. With your other hand, hold a strip of orange peel, with the skin side facing out toward the flame. Gently squeeze the peel along its horizontal edge to release the oils through the flame and onto the cocktail. This fun and simple step adds flair and flavor, perfect for impressing guests or finally using those matches you brought home from your favorite bar(s). 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coffee liqueur'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, coffee liqueur and orange bitters to a mixing glass filled with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Flame an orange peel over the top of the drink to express its oils, then garnish with the peel.']",211,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/aperol-spritz/,Aperol Spritz,Liquor.com,"Walk through an Italian town during the late-afternoon—particularly in Northern cities like Milan and Venice—and you’ll find groups of people enjoying Aperol Spritzes. The after-work spritz is a long-established Italian tradition, and fortunately, it’s one that’s easily replicated anywhere. Aperol traces its roots back to Padua, Italy. The aperitivo—an appetite-whetting beverage designed to be consumed before dinner—was created in 1919. Its bittersweet flavor, aromatic botanicals and easygoing alcohol content (it’s only 11% ABV) made it the perfect choice for pre-dinner sipping. Pair Aperol with bubbly wine and sparkling water, and you’ll be hard-pressed to find a more refreshing and thirst-quenching cocktail. And because it’s low in alcohol, you can start drinking early and still make it to dinner. While the Aperol Spritz has been enjoyed in Italy for more than a century, it didn’t reach mass appeal in the United States until the 2010s, as drinkers became more familiar with aperitivos and lower-alcohol drinks. Today, it’s a staple at cocktail bars, Italian and non-Italian restaurants, and it can be found almost anywhere that serves brunch on sunny patios. The Aperol Spritz is also a great candidate for at-home cocktail hour since it’s as easy to make as it is to drink. The three ingredients are simply combined in the glass with ice, no shaking, stirring or elaborate flourishes required. Once complete, the drink’s deliciously complex flavor and gorgeous coral hue belie you having created a classic cocktail in two minutes. While any sparkling wine can be combined with Aperol and soda, note that a true Aperol Spritz calls specifically for Italian bubbly. Proseccos range from sweet to dry, so choose one that hits the sweetness level you prefer. Then make yourself a drink and relax.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/wormhole-warrior/,Wormhole Warrior,Liquor.com,"Gin isn’t for everyone, and neither is a bracing, bitter cocktail like the Negroni . However, for those looking to try a new drink that resembles a Negroni, with a spirit similar to gin, but is its own unique concoction, then the Wormhole Warrior is a good starting place. The base of this cocktail is Cocalero Clásico Herbal Spirit, a rare spirit that shares some similarities with gin, notably a strong botanical presence that includes juniper. This bottling, though, is milder, has lower alcohol and isn’t nearly as juniper-forward, incorporating instead botanicals from South America. Cocalero is named after the coca leaf growers of Peru and Bolivia, whose indigenous people have used the leaf for medicinal and religious purposes for thousands of years. Like Green Chartreuse , cocalero is made with a closely guarded secret recipe; this one includes 17 botanicals, a number of which would not be out of place in an energy drink, like green tea, ginger, guarana and ginseng. Given its namesake, it might come as no surprise that the spirit also includes coca leaves. In this product, the coca flavors are extracted using a steam-distillation method developed by the perfume industry, and the spirit contains no narcotic elements. If viewing the Wormhole Warrior as a Negroni variation, then Tempus Fugit Gran Classico Bitter takes the role of Campari . Like Campari, Gran Classico is a bittersweet Italian aperitif, though its color and flavor profile are different—this amber hued liqueur has notes of rhubarb, orange peel, gentian and wormwood. Because of its soft colors and bittersweet flavor, it’s often used in place of Campari for golden or blanc Negronis. Rather than the traditional ratio of 1-1-1, though, this recipe calls for only 3/4 ounce of the bold and gold liqueur. The relative sweetness of both the Cocalero and the Gran Classico means that rather than using a sweet vermouth (which the classic Negroni calls for), a dry vermouth is used. Not only does it keep the drink from being overly sweet, but also gives it a clearer, brighter color. The choice of which dry vermouth you employ is up to your personal taste preferences and price point concerns, but Dolin Dry Vermouth is a reliable, affordable choice. The vermouth also goes nicely in a proper Dry Martini, for when you’re done making Wormhole Warriors.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cocalero Clásico Herbal Spirit'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Tempus Fugit Gran Classico bitter'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Cocalero Clásico, dry vermouth, Gran Classico and orange bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lemon peel and mint sprig.']",12,
https://www.liquor.com/camparinha-cocktail-recipe-5221970,Camparinha,Audrey Morgan,"Brazil’s national cocktail, the Caipirinha , has served as the starting point for plenty of spin-offs, most famously the Caipiroska , which swaps the country’s beloved spirit cachaça for vodka. This kumquat-fueled variation from bar pro Naren Young, formerly of Dante in New York City and now the creative beverage director at Sweet Liberty in Miami, retains the spirit of the original, but skips the lime in favor of kumquats and also calls for an ounce of Campari, yielding a drink that is sweet, sour, bitter, and—despite its pun-fueled name—no joking matter. The Caipirinha dates back centuries: Some historians believe the refreshing concoction of lime, sugar, and cachaça was a remedy for illness in the early 1900s, while others say it was invented by Brazilian farmers in the 19th century to showcase the sugarcane plant. Kumquats lend a fresh twist to this modern version. The tiny citrus fruits, which appear on shelves stateside as early as November and as late as April, boast a flavor that lies somewhere between a lime and a tangerine. They notoriously don’t contain much juice, which you might think would render them useless for cocktail-making, but Young has found a way around the kumquat conundrum: By muddling them in the glass with raw sugar, he draws out as much juice as possible while also releasing the essence of the peel, which is in fact a bit sweeter than the pulp. Like the Caipirinha, this cocktail gets built entirely in the glass. Mixing the muddled kumquat with equal parts cachaça and Campari creates a cross-cultural drink if there ever were one. Similar in style and flavor to rum, Brazil’s national spirit is distilled from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses, yielding grassier, funkier flavors. Meanwhile, Italy’s most famous bitter aperitivo plays off the sweet-tartness of the kumquats and gives the cocktail both its cheeky name and its blazing hue. The Camparinha is as refreshing as its Brazilian predecessor but comes with a bite. While its name doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, this drink goes down easy. And you can snack on the muddled kumquats, peels and all, once you’ve drained your glass—the best way to make the most of the stubborn but flavorful fruit.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/winter-sour/,Winter Sour,Liquor.com,"A sour cocktail is more than just a description of a tart drink. The sour is a template that features a spirit, citrus, sweetener and sometimes egg white. Within that wide category, you’ll find classics like the Sidecar , Daiquiri and Pisco Sour , plus modern classics and plenty of original creations like the Winter Sour. This low-alcohol cocktail by San Francisco bartender H. Joseph Ehrmann is bitter, sweet and seasonal. It calls for Campari, the Italian bitter red liqueur, plus Meyer lemon juice, honey syrup, egg white and a rosemary sprig. At 48 proof, Campari provides a less boozy base than most cocktails, which tend to feature spirits at 80 proof and above.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hanky-panky/,Hanky Panky,Gary Regan,"If I were stranded on a desert island—a desert island with a bar, that is—and I could have only one book to use when my memory failed me, Harry Craddock’s 1930 “The Savoy Cocktail Book” would keep me company. It’s probably the 20th century’s most important tome of its kind, having preserved many of the era’s most important drinks. Craddock, an American who fled the country when Prohibition hit in 1920, documented hundreds of drinks that he served (and, in some cases, invented) at American Bar in London’s swank Savoy Hotel. More than a few of them—the Pegu Club , for instance—are still served today in cocktail bars. The Savoy Hotel closed in 2007 for a three-year renovation, reopening in October 2010 with a few new bells and whistles. But while the establishment has been updated and modernized, cocktail fans will still recognize the historic bar. And that’s where they can still order some of the bar’s most famous drinks. Craddock wasn’t the only head bartender at the Savoy who stood out from the crowd. He followed Ada Coleman , after all. “Coley,” as she was known to her regulars, graced American Bar from 1903 until 1925 and served drinks to just about everybody, including Mark Twain, Diamond Jim Brady and the Prince of Wales. Toast her today by fixing her signature Hanky Panky, a fabulous mixture featuring equal parts gin and sweet vermouth. It starts off like a Martinez, but rather than maraschino liqueur and bitters, it receives a couple dashes of the bitter amaro Fernet-Branca for good measure. Coleman created the cocktail for Sir Charles Hawtrey, a celebrated actor who visited the bar. As the story goes, he asked for a drink with a punch. Coleman served him this fine number, leading him to exclaim “By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!” The name stuck. This recipe is adapted from Charles H. Baker Jr.’s 1939 book, “The Gentleman’s Companion.” Liquor.com / Tim Nusog","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Fernet-Branca'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, sweet vermouth and Fernet-Branca into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an orange twist.']",99,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mezcal-negroni/,Mezcal Negroni,Kevin Gray,"The three-ingredient Negroni dates to the early 20th century. Enjoyed in Italy for decades, it eventually spread throughout Europe before finding its way to American shores, eventually gaining appreciation among a new generation during the craft cocktail resurgence in the late 1990s and early 2000s. And while the original remains immensely popular, it's highly flexible equal-parts template has proven to be a popular riffing point for bartenders. The 13 Best Cocktails to Make with Campari RELATED ARTICLE The Mezcal Negroni was popularized by cocktail bars and agave-focused spots like New York City's Mayahuel, and quickly ascended to the alter of modern-classics. A seemingly simple take on the Negroni, mezcal is substituted for gin to create a drink that's significant departure from the original. Mezcal imbues the cocktail with earthy, savory and smoky qualities—a stark contrast to the dry, botanical, often citrus-forward character of gin. But mezcal is particularly effective in a Negroni due to its assertive character, which is able to deftly stand toe-to-toe with bitter Campari and herbal vermouth. The Mezcal Negroni, made with equal parts of each ingredient and stirred with ice, is easy to make and a fun deviation from the standard recipe. Try making it yourself, and see how one simple tweak can create a whole new dimension of flavor.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/toronto/,Toronto,Liquor.com,"In the long history of naming drinks after places, the Manhattan and its many borough-specific variations may be the most famous, with the Moscow Mule and Singapore Sling not far behind. But there’s another city-specific drink that deserves its due. The Toronto cocktail combines rye whiskey with Fernet-Branca, simple syrup and aromatic bitters. It’s unclear if the drink was actually invented in Toronto or just named for the city. It’s also unclear when, exactly, it was created. But the Toronto first appeared in print in Robert Vermeire’s 1922 book “Cocktails: How to Mix Them” as the Fernet Cocktail. In subsequent books, including David Embury’s “The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks,” the recipe was named the Toronto, as it’s known today. American rye makes a fine drink, and you can experiment with any rye you like, but Canadian rye will keep you on theme. Fernet-Branca is a traditional Italian digestif made from a secret mix of herbs including myrrh, saffron, chamomile and gentian. Its pronounced bitterness makes it a divisive spirit. Many people, especially those in the bar and restaurant industry, choose to drink it straight, but Fernet-Branca also appears in classic cocktails like the Hanky Panky . When used properly, its bitterness lends a subtle accent to drinks rather than overpowering them. In the Toronto, that bitterness is significantly softened by whiskey and sugar. This recipe comes from Michael Dietsch and his book “Whiskey: A Spirited Story with 75 Classic & Original Cocktails.” Dietsch stays traditional with the recipe, opting for two ounces of whiskey and a conservative quarter ounce each of the fernet and simple syrup. Depending who you ask, the Toronto is either a variation on the Manhattan or the Old Fashioned. The former camp notes that Fernet-Branca replaces sweet vermouth, while the latter camp says the fernet merely modifies the classic Old Fashioned formula of whiskey, sugar and bitters. However you splice it, the Toronto is a delicious, whiskey-forward drink with a bitter bite.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Canadian rye whisky (such as Alberta Dark Batch)'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fernet-Branca'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, Fernet-Branca, simple syrup and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with an orange twist.']",61,rye

The well-known fire-breathing brand that spread like wildfire through bars several years back got a bad rap for being a frat-house party shot, but it’s more delicious than many booze snobs may care to admit. The low-proof whiskey channels the flavor of red-hot cinnamon candies and is oddly easy to toss back as a shot, which is how most people take it. Cinnamon whiskey may start sweetly in its pure form, but it quickly rises from kindling to an inferno of a finish, with a lingering burn that kicks like an angry mule. Perhaps this is why the spirit has proved so popular: It’s exhilarating in its rocket-fuel-like quality and has even sparked competition among a series of big-brand imitators. While you can down this spicy shot at countless bars across the country, a cinnamon-whiskey facsimile* is easy to make at home, and the DIY route offers the bonus of self-satisfaction when it’s done. And it makes delicious drinks, too. If straight shots aren’t your style, try mixing the spiced whiskey into a jug of apple cider that’s crowded with autumnal fruits and honey. Cinnamon whiskey has also been known to play well with hot coffee and a cap of whipped cream, and manages to mimic the sugar-spackled delights of a famous cinnamon cereal when shaken with creamy RumChata. You can even use it in a Whiskey Sour or to make Boozy Cinnamon-Bun Oreos .

As if that weren’t indulgent enough, imagine topping it with a heavily spiked chocolate-rum sauce, with the intense flavors of semisweet chocolate and dark rum accented by light brown sugar and more vanilla extract, plus heavy cream for a rich yet perfectly pourable texture. This delightfully decadent combo of boozy ice cream and boozier chocolate sauce comes courtesy of Meagan Burke, who ran the now-defunct F&B Department, a blog devoted to alcohol-spiked desserts.

https://www.liquor.com/red-wine-reduction-sauce-recipe-5180666,Red Wine Reduction Sauce,Vicki Denig,"Cooks, both home and professional, know that cooking with wine is a way to add depth and nuance to any sauce. Mariette Bolitiski, a wine pro and Le Cordon Bleu graduate who has worked as a sommelier and wine director in several top New York City restaurants, provided this recipe. She says that she tends to gravitate toward Sangiovese-based wines when cooking, as these wines’ acidity works well with the other components of a recipe, while their fruit presence remains subtle. “When you’re cooking with wine, everything gets concentrated as you reduce the flavors, so thinking about the aromatic components matters,” she says. You’ll want to choose a decent wine, one you’d be happy drinking all on its own. That’s not just because its flavors get concentrated in a sauce. It’s also because this recipe calls for one cup of wine, meaning you’ll have about two-thirds of the bottle left over for drinking with dinner. This particular sauce pairs well with pork chops or various cuts of steak, and you might even try using it as a base for braising short ribs.

It can be sipped neat or over ice as a digestivo or used in cocktails. Several commercial brands can be found on liquor store shelves, mostly Italian with a few American companies having recently joined the mix. But you can also make it yourself. This recipe comes courtesy of Mariena Mercer, the head bartender at The Cosmopolitan in Las Vegas.

The result is rich and complex, perfect for the holiday season but delightful all year round. Many nocino recipes call for green walnuts, which are in season only briefly during the summer months and can be difficult to find. Fortunately, Mercer’s recipe calls for regular walnuts, toasted and crushed, meaning you can make this recipe at any time of the year. There’s no secret to it except patience.

Store-bought versions are the easiest way to go, but while much of what’s available now is full of corn syrup and food coloring, grenadine was originally made with pomegranate juice. Put in a tiny bit of work, and you can produce a homemade pomegranate grenadine that is guaranteed to be much more delicious than anything you can buy in a bottle. This recipe comes from Jeffrey Morgenthaler, the Portland, Oregon, bartender and writer who has impacted countless drinkers with his grenadine formula and reimagined take on the Amaretto Sour .

The finished product keeps refrigerated in an airtight container for about one month, but you can extend its shelf life by adding a small dose of booze. Morgenthaler likes to fortify his grenadine with one ounce of vodka, which acts as a preservative.

https://www.liquor.com/pineapple-cordial-recipe-4843477,Pineapple Cordial,Liquor.com,"Balance is the key to any good cocktail. Too much of any one flavor, and the drink will lack the synergy that can be achieved when sweet, sour and bitter components work in harmony. Sugar and citrus are a trustworthy pair when balancing a drink, and it’s a duo you’ll find in countless classics, including the lime-laced Daiquiri and Gimlet . But traditional citrus fruits aren’t the only way to add tartness to cocktails. At Stillife in Montreal, owner Andrew Whibley serves a menu of 32 cocktails, none of which use citrus. Instead, he utilizes various types of acids for balance, some of which are produced by fermentation. “Our main ways [to use acidity] are through cordials, for which we have a few different ways of finding balance,” he says. His team lacto-ferments all of the pulp and waste that normally would be thrown away, including citrus waste from sister establishment Cloakroom Bar , and mixes it with their cordials to act like a starter culture. The effort makes Whibley part bartender, part scientist. “We’re constantly checking the Brix and pH levels of our juices and cordials,” says Whibley. “We have a standard formula that we use in most of our cordials, and we then make sure that it stays within that range. Our standard formula is 20% sugar plus .5% acid mix (malic, citric and tartaric) for fruits with an already high pH [of the total weight], like strawberry and pineapple. For fruits that have a slightly lower pH, like pear, we do 20% sugar plus .75% acid.” That’s a lot to remember. Fortunately, he provided a recipe for his Pineapple Cordial, which you can recreate at home by purchasing a few essentials online.

https://www.liquor.com/rich-simple-syrup-recipe-4801745,Rich Simple Syrup,Liquor.com,"You need sugar to make cocktails. Sure, plenty of drinks are sweetened with liqueurs or other ingredients, but dozens of classics and countless original cocktails call for sugar. And, in many cases, they call specifically for simple syrup, an equal-parts mixture of water and granulated sugar. Simple syrup variations are endless, as the sugar-and-water duo can be combined with fruits, herbs and spices to create infused syrups. But the most common variation is rich simple syrup, an essential tool in any bartender’s arsenal. This tweaked version is every bit as easy to make as “regular” simple syrup, but it features a higher ratio of sugar to water that adds extra sweetness to your cocktails. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog The typical rich simple syrup recipe features two parts sugar and one part water. You can make it with white granulated sugar or demerara, a type of raw cane sugar with a richer taste—the latter creates a darker colored syrup. Add the sugar and water to a saucepan, and heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Once cooled, the silky liquid blends seamlessly with other ingredients when it’s shaken or stirred into your cocktails, avoiding the gritty remnants left by granulated sugar. The best part about making rich simple syrup (or regular simple syrup, for that matter) is that it will keep in your fridge for at least one month. That’s good news because it means you’ll have a stash on hand the next time you make drinks.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/simple-syrup/,Simple Syrup,Dylan Garret,"Except for alcohol, there may be no ingredient as integral to cocktails as simple syrup. Essentially just sugar water, it's a central ingredient to countless recipes, and often acts as a neutral sweetening agent in everything from a classic Daiquiri to your morning coffee. Simple syrup is used to allow sugar to be evenly mixed throughout a drink, particularly one served cold, by pre-dissolving the granulated sugar in water ahead of time to avoid clumping. It's also one of the easiest ingredients to make yourself—if you can boil water, you can make simple syrup. At its most basic, simple syrup is a 1:1 ratio of granulated sugar dissolved in an equal volume of water. From this template, an endless array of variations can be found. Common Simple Syrup Variations While there are countless ways to customize simple syrup, these four variations are most likely found in cocktail recipes. The theory behind them remains the same though—a form of sugar dissolved in water in order to better integrate into cold drinks. Rich simple syrup : Common in many recipes where sweetness is needed without excessive dilution, rich simple syrup ups the ratio to two parts sugar dissolved in one part water. This adds more heft and a rounder mouthfeel to cocktails. Demerara syrup: The method to making this variation is similar to simple syrup, using a 1:1 ratio, but opts for golden-brown demerara sugar, often sold as Sugar In The Raw. Honey syrup: As anyone who has tried to stir raw honey into a cold or room-temperature drink knows, it tends to stick to containers and stubbornly refuses to dissolve. Honey syrup dissolves it in an equal amount of water to thin it out, and allow it to integrate into drinks. Agave syrup: Similar to honey syrup, this version follows the same template to thin raw agave nectar and is an integral component of classic drinks like a Tommy's Margarita . Boost the Flavor in Your Cocktails with These 13 Syrups RELATED ARTICLE Infused Simple Syrup You can also infuse your simple syrup with countless ingredients—including spices, herbs and fruit—based on the flavor profile you want to achieve. Looking to add zip to your Paloma ? Steep a couple of jalapeño slices in your syrup. Want to give your drinks a kick of vanilla? Vanilla simple syrup is the answer. Really into ginger?

Because of the relatively high alcohol content and sealed jars, these cherries will last a few years if you keep them in a cool, dry space away from sunlight or in the refrigerator.","[{'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'pounds', 'ingredient': 'ripe, firm sweet cherries'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'allspice berries, whole'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'juniper berries, whole'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'stick', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon sticks, lightly crushed'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'pods', 'ingredient': 'star anise'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed and strained'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}]","['Pull off the stems and punch out the pits of the cherries with a cherry pitter.', 'Add the juniper berries, allspice berries, cinnamon sticks and star anise to the center of a double layer of cheesecloth and tie into a secure bundle.', 'Combine the sugar, the lemon juice and the 3 cups of water in another large stockpot that holds at least 10 quarts.

And while there’s certainly nothing wrong with a store-bought plastic bag of fluffy marshmallows, homemade ones are worlds above in terms of quality. This is especially true when said homemade treats are imbued with booze of some kind. This recipe for “adult marshmallows” isn’t specific on the booze used to flavor the desserts. Rather, it leaves it up to the baker to decide what kind of flavors they most want. Since marshmallow is a fairly neutral flavor, whatever spirit, wine or other ingredient you add will come through clearly. Some obvious inclusions are rum, bourbon and brandy, but try a mezcal or tequila-infused marshmallow in a boozy hot chocolate , or a sherry-infused marshmallow for a delicate dessert.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/almond-orgeat/,Orgeat,Liquor.com,"Tiki drinks have the reputation of being intricate, difficult-to-make cocktails featuring esoteric ingredients and elaborate garnishes. Sometimes that is true. But often, Tiki drinks get their complex flavors from lesser-known ingredients that are easy to obtain or even to make yourself. Add orgeat to that list. Orgeat is a sweet, creamy and opalescent syrup that is essential in Tiki classics like the Mai Tai , Scorpion and Fog Cutter. It was originally made with barley, but eventually, people discovered that almonds lent more flavor than the grain, so barley was retired. Exact proportions vary by the maker, but the typical orgeat recipe includes almonds, sugar, water, orange flower water and a fortifying spirit like brandy or overproof rum . This recipe calls for blanched almonds. Note that you can use the ground almonds more than once to make multiple batches, but after a couple uses they will lose their potency. Of course, you don’t have to stop at almonds. Other nuts, including pistachios and hazelnuts, also produce delicious orgeats that will spruce up your cocktails with nutty flavors and rich textures. 3 Ways to Make the Quintessential Tiki Syrup Orgeat RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'blanched almonds'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'orange flower water'}]","['Pulse the almonds in a food processor until finely ground.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pistachio-orgeat/,Pistachio Orgeat,Amanda Marsteller,"Orgeat is the French almond syrup that fortifies iconic Tiki cocktails like the Mai Tai and Scorpion with its trademark silky, nutty sweetness. Creamy and opalescent, orgeat was originally made with barley instead of almonds. When it was discovered that almonds lent much more flavor, barley dropped from the recipe entirely. The exact proportions of modern orgeat vary by maker, but the syrup generally relies on a combination of ground blanched almonds, sugar and a delicate thread of orange blossom or rose water. Almonds aren’t the only answer to orgeat, however; pistachios and hazelnuts are also popular choices, lending their own unique flavor and character to the syrup. Fortunately, orgeat is easy to make regardless of which nut you choose. After pulverizing nuts in a food processor, they’re added to a pot with sugar and water, similar to how you make simple syrup . Let the flavors infuse for several hours, and then strain the mixture. This Pistachio Orgeat recipe is dosed with a hint of vodka, which acts as a preservative, and orange flower water, which adds a floral note.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/vanilla-simple-syrup/,Vanilla Simple Syrup,Crystal Sykes,"Simple syrup is one of the primary sweeteners used in cocktails, and fortunately, it’s also one of the easiest ingredients to make. It is a mixture of granulated sugar and water, boiled until incorporated into a silky smooth syrup. But beyond those two ingredients, the variations are endless. You can play with the ratios to create a rich simple syrup, which is two parts sugar to one part water, or you can doctor your syrup with fruits, herbs and spices to achieve a new flavor profile. One of the more versatile examples is vanilla simple syrup, which can be used to add the sweet, heady flavor of vanilla to a variety of cocktails. And it’s no more difficult to make than regular simple syrup , as the only extra step is to add vanilla extract to the water and sugar mixture. However, there’s more than one way to achieve that vanilla flavor. Instead of using extract, you could infuse your simple syrup with a vanilla bean pod. In that case, cut the pot in half lengthwise, add it to the hot liquid, and let sit for several hours before using. The result is very similar to using extract, but one pod goes a long way, producing a clearer, more intense flavor. The best part about homemade vanilla simple syrup is that it can easily be adapted to any size you require. If you’re making syrup for a party, or want to keep a large stash on hand, scale up the ingredients while keeping the proportions the same. Just multiply each component by the number of servings you want to make. Or maybe the best part about simple syrup is that, once boiled, cooled and sealed, it can live a healthy, productive life for up to a month in the fridge. (Okay, so there are two best parts). Once you make a batch, you’ll always have some ready to dose your favorite drinks. Although few classic recipes call for vanilla simple syrup, it can be used to modify classics or add rich sweetness to original drinks. The Old Fashioned is a prime example of a drink in which vanilla simple syrup can truly shine. It adds flavor and body to the cocktail, while complementing the vanilla, caramel and baking spice barrel notes that are already present in the whiskey.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-syrup/,Ginger Simple Syrup,Liquor.com,"An important ingredient in a vast amount of cocktails is some kind of sweetener. Often, that sweetener is in the form of simple syrup , an aptly named blend of equal parts sugar and water, heated and integrated into a silky syrup. A number of variations arise from that simple template, including tweaking the portions for a richer syrup and infusing the mixture with an herb like ginger. After all, you can’t scoot too high up the cocktail tree without coming across a recipe that calls for ginger simple syrup. This bar staple is a must for anyone looking to make a proper version of the modern classic the Penicillin . It also goes into lesser known concoctions like the Ginger Rogers , and can be used to amplify the gingery spice of drinks like the Moscow Mule and Dark ’n Stormy , or add complexity and depth to cocktails like the Old Fashioned or Daiquiri . Swap out the plain simple syrup for this ginger version in your preferred Whiskey Sour recipe and you might discover you have a new favorite drink. And its warming, soothing presence in a Hot Toddy makes the drink even more comforting and healing. Another great use for ginger simple syrup? Homemade ginger ale. Simply add it to ice, soda water and a squeeze of lime. You can enjoy it on its own as a nonalcoholic beverage, or you can easily make a batch of Dark ’n Stormies or Ginger Ale Highballs without worrying about what ginger beer or ginger ale to use. In any case it’s an easy-to-make, easy-to-use recipe and it might become a staple behind your home bar. Be sure to keep it refrigerated, and if you add an ounce or so of vodka it will greatly extend the syrup’s shelf life, though it will mean you can no longer use it for non-alcoholic drinks.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mint-simple-syrup/,Mint Simple Syrup,Liquor.com,"There are many ways to sweeten drinks. Sugar is a staple, of course, and countless liqueurs and cordials are also at your disposal. But even basic sugar isn’t quite as basic as it seems. White granulated sugar is joined by other varieties, including turbinado and demerara, and then you have simple syrup, a combination of sugar and water than blends seamlessly into drinks. Simple syrup is made by heating water and sugar and stirring the mixture until it combines into a silky, viscous liquid. Apply that same principle, but throw some fruit, herbs or spices into the equation, and you can quickly make an infused syrup to add even more flavor to your drinks. That’s the case with Mint Simple Syrup, which tweaks the original with fresh mint leaves.

https://www.liquor.com/left-hand-cocktail-recipe-6743050,Left Hand,Liquor.com,"At first glance, it’s easy to think you’ve seen this drink before. At its essence, it’s a Boulevardier —a Negroni made with bourbon instead of gin—with modified proportions and the addition of chocolate bitters. But those two changes, small as they may seem, add up to an entirely different drink. The cocktails created by Sasha Petraske and that emerged from his team at Milk & Honey were defined by their simplicity and attention to exacting proportions. This modern classic, created by Sam Ross (of Penicillin and Paper Plane fame) is a prime example. Ross has described the drink as “a love child between a Negroni and a Manhattan ,” and the influence of both drinks can be easily seen. The spirit-Campari-sweet vermouth combination of the Negroni is obvious, while the Manhattan’s 2-to-1 ratio of whiskey and sweet vermouth, plus bitters, simply gets an additional splash of Campari. More than a few bartenders, contemporary and classic, have found that the addition of one single ingredient, even in small quantities, can send a cocktail spinning in an entirely new direction. Here, that ingredient is chocolate bitters. “Before the Boulevardier came back into prominence, this was a bourbon riff on the Negroni that we created using the newly released chocolate bitters from Bittermen’s,” says Ross in Petraske’s 2016 book Regarding Cocktails . Rounding out the spiced softness of both the bourbon and the sweet vermouth, and tempering the Campari’s sharp bitterness, the bitters also impart a distinct complexity that turns the drink into something that may gently evoke a chocolate-covered cherry in the best and booziest of ways. It was part of a line of drinks that arose at the bar. “We created a series of ‘Hand’ cocktails in the early days of Milk & Honey,” says Ross in the book. “The Right Hand was an aged-rum take; Tres Hands was is mezcal-and-tequila sister; and the Smoking Hand was her brother from Islay and the Highlands.” This particular cocktail, however, has become perhaps the most well-known of the series. Its success is for good reason. “Sasha reserved his compliments for only a few drinks, but this was one of our cocktails in the ‘Hand’ series that he loved,” says Ross. “‘Well played, Sam,’ [Sasha] said.” Boulevardier 686 ratings","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth (preferably Carpano Antica)'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'chocolate bitters (such as Bittermen’s)'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a brandied cherry.']",40,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/kentucky-buck-cocktail-recipe-6740524,Kentucky Buck,Audrey Morgan,"The Buck doesn’t stop at Moscow Mules . Just look at the Kentucky Buck, a bourbon-based modern classic from Erick Castro, the co-owner of Polite Provisions and Raised by Wolves in San Diego. The simple and delicious strawberry-and-ginger drink has become a favorite order at bars around the country since it debuted more than a decade ago. Castro created the Kentucky Buck in 2008 when he was working at San Francisco’s Bourbon & Branch , where he was developing a submission for the spring cocktail menu. Inspired by in-season strawberries and a lack of bourbon drinks in the classic cocktail books he was reading at the time, he came up with a fruity bourbon-fueled take on the Buck . “I was smitten with the category,” he says of the classic Buck formula, which includes a spirit, citrus, and ginger ale or ginger beer. Castro played around with his version for a couple of months, but the “aha!” moment arrived when he added some Angostura bitters. “Angostura makes everything better,” he says. The Kentucky Buck didn’t become a permanent menu item at Bourbon & Branch, but six months later, Castro took it to Rickhouse , a new whiskey-focused bar where he had signed on as beverage director. “Every new bar needs a signature drink, and at Rickhouse it just jammed,” he says. He estimates the bar sold more than 30,000 Kentucky Bucks the year it debuted. Castro has a few theories as to why the drink took off. “Red drinks always sell,” he says. Not only was it pretty, but its ingredients were familiar to customers. “No one has to go, ‘What’s Averna? Am I saying that right?’ You can look at the drink on a menu and order it with confidence,” he says. But the drink’s biggest selling point is almost certainly how delicious it is, no matter what ingredients you have on hand. “In order for a drink to be a classic, or a modern classic especially, there has to be a lot of wiggle room,” says Castro. In the case of the Kentucky Buck, you can use a high-end or bottom-shelf bourbon, lemon or lime juice, or homemade ginger beer or a bottled one. Castro says he has even seen a version of the drink at dive bars made with ginger beer, a squeeze of lemon juice, and a float of strawberry liqueur. The recipe below employs a homemade ginger syrup alongside club soda, producing an extra-refreshing drink. The Kentucky Buck might have gotten its start on a spring cocktail menu, but it’s irresistible any time of year.

https://www.liquor.com/kentucky-maid-cocktail-recipe-6543313,Kentucky Maid,Audrey Morgan,"You’d be hard-pressed to walk into a cocktail bar worth its bitters and not find a Sam Ross cocktail on the menu: The co-owner of Attaboy and a partner in the recently reopened Temple Bar has a long list of modern classics on his C.V., including the Paper Plane , a bourbon-and-Aperol Last Word variation, and the Penicillin , a scotch sour spiced with honey-ginger syrup. In the early days of the craft-cocktail renaissance, Ross spent seven years as the head bartender at the late Sasha Petraske’s seminal New York City bar Milk & Honey, where in 2005 he developed the Kentucky Maid, a refreshing bourbon drink made with muddled cucumber, mint leaves, and simple syrup. In creating this drink, Ross riffed on the London Maid, which he first shook up for bar pro and Speed Rack co-founder Lynnette Marrero when she was a customer at another Petraske bar, East Side Company. That version had gin as its base instead of bourbon, and was originally called the “Ol’ Biddy,” a name Petraske vetoed. Ross changed the name, and a new drinks category, the Maid, was born. “The same drink can be made with any base spirit; just change the first part of the name to align with the origins of the spirit used—in this case, bourbon,” he says in Petraske’s 2016 book Regarding Cocktails . Add tequila and you have a Mexican Maid; the Polish Maid uses vodka, while the Irish Maid swaps in Irish whiskey for the bourbon and adds St-Germain liqueur for floral notes. The Kentucky Maid is somewhat like the Mint Julep , but the muddled cucumber and fresh lime juice temper the sweetness and add an even more refreshing flavor profile. You might also find the drink similar to a Whiskey Smash , which calls for muddling lemon wedges with simple syrup, then topping with bourbon. For this cocktail, Ross reaches for Elijah Craig Small Batch, a high-proof bourbon that is known for its warm spice notes. But of course, with a drink this riffable, you can use whichever bottle you prefer. Feel free to take liberties with all of the ingredients, following the tried-and-true formula of spirit, citrus, mint, and cucumber. You might just have to come up with a new name for your creation.

https://www.liquor.com/improved-whiskey-cocktail-recipe-6503380,Improved Whiskey Cocktail,Liquor.com,"The Old Fashioned is hardly a drink that needs improvement: The simple combination of bourbon or rye whiskey, bitters, and sugar has been one of the most beloved cocktails in existence for 200-plus years. But the dictionary definition of “improve” doesn’t quite apply to drinks. And at one time, what we now call Old Fashioned-style cocktails were synonymous with, well, cocktails, which almost always followed the same formula: spirit, sugar, water, and bitters. The Old Fashioned as we know it today was simply called the Whiskey Cocktail, a Brandy Old Fashioned was a Brandy Cocktail, and so on. In the late 1800s, bartenders began “improving” these drinks with the addition of imported European ingredients such as maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and curaçao. Because of the limited cocktail canon at the time, this handful of ingredients made a world of difference in the possibilities of drinks-making. Jerry Thomas , widely considered the godfather of modern bartending, was the first to record and categorize cocktails with his 1862 book The Bar-Tender’s Guide or How to Mix Drinks . And in the 1887 edition, he introduced the Improved Whiskey Cocktail in print, along with the Improved Brandy Cocktail and the Improved Gin Cocktail . Thomas’s version called for bourbon or rye, Boker’s or Angostura bitters, gum syrup (a sweetener similar to simple syrup that includes gum arabic), maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and a lemon twist. “The flavor is improved by moistening the edge of the cocktail glass with a piece of lemon,” he wrote. Thomas’s recipe has evolved over the years. As is the case with an Old Fashioned, you can use bourbon or rye whiskey, depending on your preferences; the latter will produce a slightly spicier drink. And if you prefer using sugar to simple syrup and don’t mind an additional step, you can muddle a sugar cube with the bitters and water before adding the other ingredients. The “improving” ingredients are used in limited quantities—just a barspoon of maraschino liqueur and a dash of absinthe—but they lend the drink additional complexity. Many modern recipes also call for a dash of Peychaud’s bitters in addition to Angostura, rendering a drink that is similar on paper to New Orleans’ most storied cocktail, the absinthe-rinsed Sazerac . Today, this old-school drink has modern-day appeal; in fact, the Improved Whiskey Cocktail is one of the most popular orders at Brooklyn’s Clover Club , where it is made with rye whiskey and has been on the menu since the seminal cocktail bar opened in 2008.

She starts off by making a Wassail , a traditional warming harvest drink, with brown ale and oloroso sherry. “I'm a huge fan of making wassail or mulled ale in the early winter,” she says. She then reduces the leftover wassail to make a richly spiced syrup. “Mulled ale is already on its way to being a syrup,” she says, figuring she might as well take it the rest of the way for cocktail use. Be careful when reducing the Wassail for the syrup. “Remember, as far as temperature goes, always keep it low and on a simmer at most,” says Tseng. “Try to avoid boiling the mixture to preserve the wine’s characteristics.” How to Use Wine Syrups in Your Drinks RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon (or brandy)'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'wassail syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'freshly grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, wassail syrup, lemon and orange juices, and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Express the oils from a lemon twist over the drink, then drop the twist into the glass.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",6,bourbon

https://www.liquor.com/bordeaux-sour-cocktail-recipe-5075074,Bordeaux Sour,Liquor.com,"The Whiskey Sour is one of the cocktail world’s simplest pleasures. When properly made with whiskey, sweetener, citrus and (optionally) egg white or aquafaba, it’s an elegant balance of sweet and tart, smooth and bold. But while it’s not a drink that requires tinkering, it is a template that encourages it, leading to all kinds of takes on the classic. One well-established version includes a red wine float; that transforms it into a New York Sour , and it’s this base that the Bordeaux Sour riffs on. The Bordeaux Sour comes from Michael Biddick, the owner and sommelier of the Latin American restaurant Blend 111 outside of Washington, D.C. With a heavy focus on high-end wines at Blend 111, it makes sense to incorporate wine into cocktails. “It’s great when we have opportunities to create crossover opportunities and use our wines as a key component in our cocktails,” says Biddick. Rather than the usual simple syrup, Biddick’s New York Sour-esque cocktail begins with muddling maple syrup with a maraschino cherry; it’s important to use fruit of decent quality, like Luxardo maraschino cherries , rather than one of the electric red, artificially flavored cherries from the bygone days of bartending. And rather than a red-wine float, the wine is mixed with the drink. Biddick uses a red wine from Bordeaux’s famed Cadillac subregion, which enhances the toasted oak, caramel and vanilla notes in the Maker’s Mark 46 bourbon that the recipe calls for. However, if making this at home feel free to substitute your favorite bourbon for the Maker’s Mark. This variation eschews the frothy texture brought by the usual addition of egg white, instead relying on the richness of the maple syrup. “The fresh-squeezed lemon juice adds brightness, and the touch of maple syrup takes all of the rough edges off the drink,” says Biddick. The drink also gets additional astringency and citrus notes from five dashes of orange bitters, rather than the optional and more reserved amount of Angostura bitters that garnishes a Whiskey Sour. 5 Easy Whiskey Sour Twists to Make Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'maple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'red wine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the cherry and maple syrup.', 'Add the bourbon, red wine, lemon juice and orange bitters with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a maraschino cherry.']",54,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/dizzy-delight-cocktail-recipe-5073338,Dizzy Delight,Kelly Magyarics,"The Ramos Gin Fizz is a New Orleans institution that has traveled to all corners of the world. Drinkers love its creamy taste and frothy texture, but it elicits a love/hate feeling among bartenders for one reason: It takes so long to make that one order can put even the best barkeep in the weeds. That’s why the drink’s inventor, Carl Ramos, supposedly employed a chain of “shaker men” in his bar to meet the constant demand. Samantha Montgomery, the national brand ambassador for Bardstown Bourbon Company , has a solution to that problem. Inspired by the classic Ramos Gin Fizz , she created a bourbon-based riff that uses a handheld milk frother to aerate the drink, eliminating the seemingly endless amount of shaking that’s usually required. “I found that with the milk frother you can achieve identical results in a fraction of that time,” she says. The Dizzy Delight mixes bourbon with grapefruit juice, star-anise-infused honey syrup, Yellow Chartreuse, cream, egg white and soda water. You still shake the drink to chill it, but the milk frother does the bulk of the work. “It’s incredibly beautiful, smooth and delicious, and you’ll spare yourself the 12-minute arm workout,” says Montgomery. You can use this trick to open up a whole host of variations on the drink, swapping out spirits, citruses, infused syrups and modifiers.

However, several cocktails have claimed the Millionaire moniker over the past century, and versions differ wildly. Most are divided between the Millionaire No. 1, which contains Jamaican rum, sloe gin and apricot brandy, and the Millionaire No. 2, which is the bourbon-based sour you'll find here. In addition to bourbon, the Millionaire features Grand Marnier (a French orange liqueur made with cognac), lemon juice, grenadine, absinthe and egg white. Use fresh lemon juice and homemade grenadine for the best results. The former is easy enough—just squeeze some lemons. Homemade grenadine is somewhat more complicated, but can be concocted easily at home with fresh pomegranates or pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses, sugar, and orange flower water.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lions-tail/,Lion’s Tail,Liquor.com,"The Lion’s Tail first appeared in “The Café Royal Cocktail Book,” which was published in 1937. But it’s likely the drink was born during Prohibition, when onerous laws couldn’t keep thirsty denizens from partaking in illicit concoctions. The book was published in London, but many believe the cocktail was created by an American. Their reasoning: The drink’s name refers to the saying “twisting the lion’s tail,” a phrase that describes provoking the British, whose royal coat of arms features a lion. Featuring bourbon, allspice dram (a liqueur made with rum, pimento berries and spices), fresh lime juice, simple syrup and aromatic bitters, the Lion’s Tail is an unusual drink that nearly slides into Tiki territory. But for all its talent and charm, the cocktail was forgotten for decades, resurfacing in the late-aughts thanks to the timely confluence of literature and product availability. Allspice dram lost favor after the mid-century Tiki boom and then disappeared from circulation altogether in the 1980s. That changed when St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram arrived stateside in 2008. This Austrian-made liqueur hit the market one year before the updated release of Ted Haigh’s “ Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails ,” an important tome that heralded the return of many obscure and buried drinks, including the Lion’s Tail. Once bartenders had a recipe and the missing ingredient to work with, Lion’s Tails began popping up at bars all over the country. It’s easy to see why: The drink is rich, spicy and aromatic and appeals to fans of both the Daiquiri and the Whiskey Sour . It leans heavily on the allspice and Angostura bitters without overpowering the bourbon, the lime adds a hint of tartness, and the simple syrup lends balance.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-old-fashioned/,Old Fashioned,Dylan Garret,"The Old Fashioned is arguably the most well-known whiskey cocktail in the world. Essentially just a slug of bourbon that’s been lightly sweetened with sugar and modified with a couple dashes of bitters, it’s dead simple to make, but within this basic template is a world of opinions and flavor. The Old Fashioned as we know it comes from an early mixed drink simply called the Whiskey Cocktail, thought to be popularized in the late 1700s when it was fashionable to add a few dashes of bitters to a glass of whiskey. The cocktail’s creation goes hand in hand with the proliferation of both whiskey and commercial bitters, an aromatic ingredient with medicinal origins that involved steeping herbs, barks, botanicals, and other plant extracts in spirits to create a curative that could be mixed with water or other ingredients, often to aid in digestion. Over time, several variations on the Whiskey Cocktail developed (not unlike modern bartending’s endless riffs on classic drinks), from the Improved Whiskey Cocktail’s addition of absinthe to the Fancy Whiskey Cocktail’s orange curacao. As the variations grew, those seeking the stripped-down original version took to asking for an “Old-Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail.” This order eventually evolved into a drink with ice in a rocks glass and simply became known as an Old Fashioned. Old Fashioned vs. Manhattan: What's the Difference? RELATED ARTICLE While modern recipes often reflect the most unadorned version of this drink, bartenders as far back as Prohibition were experimenting with the serve, regularly muddling fruit such as cherries, oranges, and even pineapple into the mix. Some of these preparations persisted throughout the 20th century, and today some variations like the Wisconsin Old Fashioned still call for the addition of fruit. However, as a return to classic recipes gained popularity around the turn of the millennium, the Old Fashioned started to take on its, well, old-fashioned specs once again. Why the Old Fashioned Cocktail Works The three-part template of the Old Fashioned is one that’s found in countless spirit-forward and aromatic cocktails today: spirit, sugar, and bitters. The key lies in finding the right balance between this trinity of elements, as there aren’t any other ingredients to help mask flavors or create wiggle room. Sugar softens the whiskey, tamping down the liquor’s heat while creating a more viscous mouthfeel and allowing its subtler elements to shine through. Bitters temper the sugar’s sweetness and help add depth of flavor that keeps the drink from becoming cloying. What creates a perfect Old Fashioned is the harmony of these three elements—each should accentuate the others’ aspects without dominating or overpowering them. That is to say, a properly made Old Fashioned shouldn’t taste sweet, nor should it taste bitter, nor should it taste overwhelmingly of straight whiskey. When you sip the drink and can’t pick out any one of these qualities over the others, you’ve got a proper Old Fashioned. The Liquor.com Guide to Bourbon RELATED ARTICLE The Best Type of Whiskey for an Old Fashioned We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Your personal preference in whiskey is more important than what’s written in old cocktail recipe books. The Old Fashioned template is simple and broad enough that it will work with almost any style of whiskey. With that said, bourbon is often the go-to whiskey choice for an Old Fashioned. The relatively heavy body of the mostly corn-based spirit creates structure within the cocktail, and its natural sweetness helps counterbalance the more astringent elements of bitters. As bourbon is aged in charred new oak barrels, it tends to take on notes of vanilla and caramel, which are brought out by the addition of sugar.  They also help to reduce the perceived heat of the alcohol, in turn allowing the spirit’s nuances to come through more cleanly. Despite bourbon’s popularity, your whiskey of choice should really be tailored to the profile of the drink you desire. If you’re looking for an Old Fashioned that is spicier or with a drier finish, a rye whiskey may be the ideal choice. Fans of scotch will find that a blend or even a single malt can fit the cocktail template well. And as shown through recipes like the Oaxaca Old Fashioned , sometimes the best whiskey for an Old Fashioned isn’t even a whiskey at all.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whats-up-doc/,"What’s Up, Doc",Kelly Magyarics,"Originally created by lead bartender Eduardo “Eddy” Rocha for SaltRock Southwest Kitchen Amara Resort and Spa in Sedona, Arizona, this bright, fresh bourbon cocktail incorporates freshly-juiced carrot and ginger with bitter, herbal Fernet-Branca , fresh lemon, and an aromatic herb garnish. While Rocha gravitates to the Robot Coupe juicer for his juicing endeavors, you can certainly use a more economical version at home—whatever gets the job done. In a pinch, if you can find fresh carrot juice and fresh ginger juice at your local grocery store, that works too. “Nature has made a perfect cocktail in most fruits [and vegetables], so you only need to extract that essence and allow the drink to balance itself,” he says. “For example, a shot of bourbon and a freshly juiced apple is a favorite of mine—so simple yet so complete.” The taste of a cocktail made with freshly-juiced produce (versus pre-made) generally tastes brighter and more vibrant, and is far more expressive and true to form than any bottled juice, the main differences being in the absence of stabilizers, oxidation and the presence of packaging. This goes for some of the most common juices used in cocktails, i.e. lemon and lime juice—fresh is always best as nothing else really compares. Once you’ve mastered the What’s Up, Doc, you can put your juicer to use for a number of other cocktails, like the Cucumber Cleanse or the Beet Rose , or you can experiment with your own recipes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-strawberry-iced-tea/,Bourbon Strawberry Iced Tea,Liquor.com,"There are few things more refreshing on a hot summer day than a frosty, ice-filled glass (or pitcher) of iced tea. But sometimes you need a fancier approach, and that’s when bourbon—a perfect accompaniment to iced tea—comes into play. Add some sweetness with fruit and sugar and a bit of tartness from squeezed lemon—itself an iced tea essential—and you have quite the pleasing summer libation. The Bourbon Strawberry Iced Tea is just that, a mellow summer sipper, perfect for the Fourth of July or any other day you’re craving something tall, cool and easy-drinking. Besides it being a crowd-pleaser thanks to its flavors, it’s also a breeze to assemble, which is helpful if you’re making a suite of these for a group, say on a beach trip or when hosting a backyard barbecue. Muddle strawberries with lemon juice, shake with ice, bourbon and simple syrup, pour over fresh ice with unsweetened tea, and it’s done. All that is needed is a straw and, optionally, some berries and mint for a striking garnish. This means you can easily make a batch of them and continue to refill glasses as long as you don’t run out of ice. Another attractive aspect of the summery drink is its versatility. While strawberries pair excellently with bourbon, you could substitute a fruit like raspberries or even blueberries, depending on what’s freshest and most available. Or shift gears and use a flavored tea—a peach black tea or similar flavor can bring even more fruity, summery notes without increasing the sweetness of the drink. And when it comes to sweetness, you can always adjust the levels of simple syrup or use an infused syrup, like mint simple syrup , to add depth. For the liquor, bourbon is still the best bet, but swapping it for another dark spirit like an aged rum can work well . Be sure to avoid anything too botanical though, like gin or aquavit, as it might clash with the natural tannins in the tea and lead to an overly bitter final product.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bentons-old-fashioned/,Benton’s Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"Liquor is perhaps the world’s greatest liquid, but that hasn’t stopped countless bartenders from infusing it with a host of ingredients. Some focus on simple infusions, like vodka and pineapple or rum with baking spices. Others go a different route, finding synergy among seemingly disparate ingredients. Case in point: Don Lee, who infused bourbon with smoky country ham for the (now legendary) Benton’s Old Fashioned. The year was 2007, and the place was PDT, the seminal New York cocktail bar. Lee began experimenting with fat-washing, in which liquid fat is infused in liquor. The combination is frozen, and then the solids are skimmed off, leaving you with a rich, savory spirit imbued with the flavor of the fat—in Lee’s case, that meant Benton’s country ham. He then combined the infused spirit with maple syrup and Angostura bitters for a rich, unique take on the classic Old Fashioned . Lee’s move also kickstarted a technique that’s still in use at bars all over the world. This cocktail is relatively easy to make at home, provided you don’t mind cooking some ham or bacon beforehand.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gold-rush/,Gold Rush,Liquor.com,"On paper, the Gold Rush is a very simple drink. Composed of bourbon, honey syrup and fresh lemon juice, it’s essentially a Whiskey Sour with honey in place of sugar. This also essentially makes it a variation on the classic Bee’s Knees cocktail, but one that uses bourbon rather than gin. The interplay of whiskey and honey transforms the cocktail’s flavor and mouthfeel, making the Gold Rush a drink that transcends the sum of its parts. The Gold Rush was first created at famed New York City bar Milk & Honey in the early 2000s, and became a staple of bars worldwide at such a pace that the cocktail is often commonly assumed to have been a pre-Prohibition classic, rather than a modern drink. But its appearance came at a time when new drinks were appearing all over the U.S. fueled by a new generation of craft bartenders experimenting with tweaks to classic cocktails. Newly available liqueurs were poured liberally, alternate base spirits were swapped into tried-and-true recipes, and rules were broken with regularity. This era resulted in many great success stories like the Gold Rush, as well as the Penicillin , another Milk & Honey creation which follows the same template but substitutes Scotch whiskey for bourbon, and incorporates a touch of ginger. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog. When making the Gold Rush, choose a decent quality bourbon with a little age on it. You don’t need one that's too old, as heavy oak can overpower the other ingredients. But a whiskey in the four-to-eight-year range will do nicely. Rather than adding honey straight into the shaker, create a honey syrup first by stirring equal parts honey and water together until fully dissolved. This will allow the honey to more easily mix into the drink while shaking, rather than stick to the bottom of your shaker. Similar to creating simple syrup , combining a one-to-one ratio of honey and water works well, but if you want a fuller drink, you can double the amount of honey used to make your syrup, which will enhance the cocktail's mouthfeel and create a richer taste. Fresh lemon juice is key to cut through the honey and whiskey, and bring balance to the cocktail. 9 Easy 3-Ingredient Drinks to Make at Home RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, honey syrup, and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled rocks glass over one large ice cube.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",284,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/pan-american-clipper-cocktail-recipe-6826508,Pan American Clipper,Liquor.com,"Pan American Airways, “Pan Am” for short, was at one point the epitome of style for jet-setting travelers, so it’s no surprise that its eponymous cocktail is equally fabulous. A mixture of apple brandy, lime juice, grenadine, and absinthe, the bright-hued sour dates to 1939, when prolific cocktail writer and world traveler Charles H. Baker included the recipe in The Gentleman’s Companion . Baker had settled down in Coconut Grove, Florida, near Pan Am’s first international airport; in his seminal book, he wrote that the recipe came “from the notebook of one of our pilot friends who—when off duty—may seek one.” The off-duty pilot’s drink of choice certainly owes a significant debt to the Jack Rose , a sour-format cocktail created around the turn of the 20th century, which combines apple brandy with lemon juice and grenadine. (Applejack is the drink’s original base spirit, hence its name.) Like another Gentleman’s Companion drink, the Remember the Maine , the Pan American Clipper adds anise-flavored absinthe, at that time an ingredient of questionable legality in the U.S., an inclusion that likely reflected its creator’s travels around the globe. St. John Frizell, the owner of Brooklyn’s Fort Defiance and the newly reopened Gage & Tollner , is widely credited with helping to revive the legacy of Baker , and in 2014 he put the Pan American Clipper on the menu at Fort Defiance; it also appears at his tropical-influenced bar Sunken Harbor Club . If you’d like to honor the drink’s American roots, you can reach for Laird’s Straight Apple Brandy, as Frizell did in his version. Laird’s is perhaps the best-known American apple brandy , with a colonial history dating to the 1600s. (George Washington once asked for the recipe.) In keeping with the globe-trotting of Baker himself, you can instead use calvados, which is produced in the Normandy region of France. Whichever apple spirit you use, you’ll want to opt for apple brandy instead of applejack for the drink’s backbone; the latter is blended with neutral grain spirits, resulting in a thinner and slightly less complex apple flavor profile. Although grenadine might make you think of a saccharine-sweet Shirley Temple (or its grown-up big sister, the Dirty Shirley ), the pomegranate-based ingredient is in fact the sweetening agent of many excellent pre-Prohibition cocktails, including the Pink Lady and the Ward Eight .

https://www.liquor.com/fog-cutter-cocktail-recipe-5536846,Fog Cutter,Liquor.com,"Cocktail names often offer fanciful promises: See the Corpse Reviver No. 2 and the Painkiller . According to the inventor of the Fog Cutter himself, this potent mix of three spirits, citrus juices, and orgeat, with a sherry float, may indeed clear things up for any drinker…but it’s just as likely to make them even foggier. “Fog Cutter, hell. After two of these you won’t even see the stuff,” wrote Victor “Trader Vic” Bergeron in his 1947 book Bartender’s Guide . Bergeron started serving the Tiki classic at his Oakland, California bar, Trader Vic’s, in the 1940s. He was one of the early imitators of Donn Beach (née Ernest Gantt), who opened his Hollywood bar Don the Beachcomber in 1934 as Prohibition was winding down, inspired by his travels in the South Pacific. While Beach might have originated a certain brand of kitschy, thatch-roofed bars slinging rum-based cocktails out of carved mugs, Bergeron helped to popularize Tiki culture with drinks including the Mai Tai and the Fog Cutter, or Samoan Fog Cutter. Like many Tiki drinks, the latter wasn’t designed for the faint-hearted; in fact, at Trader Vic’s, there was a strict two-drink limit for Fog Cutter imbibers. While Tiki drinks often blend rums , this classic blends three different spirits: light rum, cognac, and London Dry gin. It’s similar in, ahem, spirit to another Bergeron invention, the Scorpion Bowl, which also includes multiple liquors and citrus juices. Although it’s undoubtedly strong, the drink is still delicious, thanks to the citrus juices and orgeat , an almond-based mainstay in Tiki cocktails. The drink also calls for a sherry float, slightly upping the alcohol ante. You’ll want to reach for an oloroso sherry for its sweetness and rich, nutty notes that pair well with the orgeat and citrus juices. Today, you’ll find many variations on the drink. San Francisco’s Smuggler’s Cove adds pisco to the mix in lieu of cognac; The now-shuttered Lost Lake in Chicago called for orange curaçao instead of orange juice and swapped the light rum for a funkier rhum agricole. But at Trader Vic’s, where it’s still called the Samoan Fog Cutter, the original recipe remains. The drink even has its own mug , but it will taste just as delicious out of a Collins glass. No matter how you serve it, the liquid inside will live up to its fog-clearing, or -enhancing, promises. 11 Orgeat Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'light rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cognac'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'London Dry gin'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orgeat'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'oloroso sherry'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients except the sherry into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled Collins glass filled with crushed ice, adding additional crushed ice if needed.', 'Float the sherry on top.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",39,rum
https://www.liquor.com/hawksmoor-apple-martini-cocktail-recipe-5223103,Hawksmoor Apple Martini,Tyler Zielinski,"The Appletini , the much-maligned ’90s classic, was once so ubiquitous it became a cultural punchline, used everywhere from Scrubs to The Social Network as shorthand for questionable taste. Originally a fairly delicious combination of vodka, apple schnapps, and house-made sour mix, garnished with lemon-water-soaked Granny Smith apple slices, somewhere along the line as it spread across the country it devolved into an overly saccharine mixture associated with chain restaurants and a general lack of sophistication. Ultimately, it fell out of favor as fresh juices and other quality cocktail ingredients became more widely used. But as with other members of the ’Tini family (most notably the Espresso Martini and the Cosmopolitan ), the Appletini is seeing a resurgence. This elevated version comes from Hawksmoor NYC , the stateside branch of a popular London-based group of steakhouses. “When we put the Apple Martini on the Hawksmoor NYC menu, we wanted to take a drink that was viewed as pretty awful and do a delicious, modern version of it,” says Adam Montgomerie, the bar manager at the restaurant. His version uses both apple and pear eaux de vie, plus a touch of verjus, Lillet blanc, simple syrup, and a malic acid mixture. An apple blossom floated in the drink provides an elegant finishing touch. “It tastes like biting into a fresh, bright, green apple and is bright and refreshing,” says Montgomerie. It’s a rare entry into the fruity-Tini category that bears the crisp refreshing qualities of a true Martini , earning its name through function and not just form.

https://www.liquor.com/longines-cocktail-recipe-5216697,Longines,David Wondrich,"The American art of the bar had some pretty dodgy decades in the 20th century. Prohibition put a lot of the older master bartenders out of business in the U.S., while around the world, bartenders were still getting comfortable with all the various cocktails, fizzes, sours, coolers, and whatnot that made up the classic repertoire. Many of the bartenders who were driving that process of familiarization had experience in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Boston, and New Orleans joints. But the greatest mixologist of the mid-20th century had not only never worked in the U.S., but also, as far as we can tell, visited just once. Constante Ribalaigua Vert was born outside of Barcelona in 1888. By 1900, his family had emigrated to Havana, where his father tended bar at the venerable cafe Piña de Plata. When Ribalaigua was 16, as he told the American author Thomas Sugrue in 1935, his father “asked him if he wished to learn barkeeping.” He said yes. By then, Cuba was swarming with Americans, and the establishment had been turned into an American-style bar called “La Florida.” In 1918, he had earned enough to assume ownership of the “Floridita”—the “Little Florida”—as it was universally known. Apparently, when Ribalaigua told Sugrue that his “only hobby is his work,” he wasn’t kidding. He didn’t even drink. What he did do—besides inventing a new cocktail practically every day—was to make sure that his customers got the best drinks and the best service, whether they were Ernest Hemingway, Spencer Tracy, or the couple visiting from Des Moines. He was still pulling shifts when he died in 1952. What made his tipples so special? Ribalaigua always used quality ingredients, of course. He kept up with technology and created imaginative combinations of flavors (though not too imaginative). But most of all, he was a master of proportion. I’ve tried just about every recipe included in the little pamphlet he gave out, and they have been perfect, requiring no adjustments. The Longines cocktail is a fine example of his work: unusual, but not weird, using ingredients that blend together to form a harmonious whole.

This large-batch recipe, adapted from the December 1945 edition of Gourmet magazine by bar pro Derek Brown of Washington, DC’s Columbia Room , makes enough to keep an entire party’s worth of people merry and bright. Eggnog recipes are known to be flexible in their selection of base spirits; the creamy ingredients play well with a spectrum of spirits, from spiced rum to bourbon or brandy. And why choose between them when you can have both cognac and rum in your punch cup? This recipe calls for both, adding cognac’s elegant fruity notes to the rich funkiness of Jamaican rum. There’s no need to splurge on a fancy cognac, though; VS will do just fine. “The higher alcohol level will cut through the sweetness of the rest of the ingredients,” says Brown. He does, however, advocate for using freshly grated nutmeg rather than something out of a spice jar. “It’s a really different taste from what you’d get in a jar of McCormick,” he says. 5 Tips for Making the Best Eggnog RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2 dozen', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'eggs, separated'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '750mL bottle', 'ingredient': 'VS cognac or other brandy'}, {'quantity': '16', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Jamaican rum'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'pounds', 'ingredient': 'powdered sugar'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'quarts', 'ingredient': 'whole milk, chilled'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'quart', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream, chilled'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'salt'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'freshly grated nutmeg'}]","['In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks until light and lemon-colored.', 'While continuing to beat, add the brandy, rum, sugar, milk, heavy cream and salt.', 'In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites and nutmeg until they form stiff peaks.', 'Fold the whites into the yolk mixture.', 'Serve in punch cups.']",27,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/porto-flip-cocktail-recipe-5208411,Porto Flip,Liquor.com,"Flips are a type of cocktail characterized by the inclusion of an entire egg. Cocktails that call for egg whites are, of course, common; it’s a way of adding texture and body to a drink. It’s less common to use the yolks as well, however, which is why those drinks get their own category. Flips tend to be rich and frothy cold-weather drinks. This one is a perfect example. This variation on a Porto Flip comes from distiller and bar pro Allen Katz. In its most traditional form, the cocktail calls for brandy, tawny port , and an egg yolk. The drink is itself a variation on the Coffee Cocktail that appeared in Jerry Thomas’s 1862 cocktail guide The Bartender’s Guide: How to Mix Drinks; A Bon Vivant’s Companion (which doesn’t actually contain any coffee; the drink was named for its appearance). Katz changes up the standard quite a bit: He increases the quantity of port over what’s typically called for and swaps out the nutty tawny version for the fruitier ruby type; he upgrades standard brandy to cognac; he opts for a whole egg rather than just the yolk, and he adds in a splash of heavy cream for extra rich body and flavor. Most notably, a barspoon of yellow Chartreuse is added at the end, its sweet, herbaceous notes topping the drink. It all adds up to a richly textured cocktail full of autumn and winter flavors, ideal for cold-weather sipping.

https://www.liquor.com/spiced-apple-cider-recipe-5206530,Spiced Apple Cider,Liquor.com,"Few things make autumn worth looking forward to more than the seasonal return of apple cider, spiked or not. The mix of tart-and-sweet cider, combined with wintery baking spices and brightened with orange, warms the spirit as well as the body and evokes a certain type of nostalgia for many. The most important consideration when making spiced cider is the type of cider to use. Fresh apple cider is essential. There’s a time and a place for sparkling or hard ciders, but not here. Depending on what part of the country you’re in, a local farmers market might be a great source. Otherwise, you’re most likely to find fresh apple cider in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. It should be cloudy, not clear. The spices given here are a starting point; feel free to throw in a chunk of fresh ginger, a few black peppercorns or anything else you wish. Note that whole spices are called for because they’re easier to strain out. If you choose to go with ground spices instead, use a sachet to infuse them so you don’t end up with spice bits floating at the top of your drink. Making it in a saucepan on the stove produces results most quickly (and allows the aroma to drift, which is half the fun of making it), but if you have a Crock-Pot and a few hours, you can go that way instead; simply add everything into the pot and heat it on low for 3 to 4 hours.

https://www.liquor.com/all-the-way-up-cocktail-recipe-5120719,All the Way Up,Kate Dingwall,"Tom Garvin, the beverage director at Tribeca's Kitchen , calls this cocktail “one of my favorite grenadine drinks I’ve ever made.” A fan of the fruity cocktail sweetener, Garvin finds it burdened with misconceptions. “Instead of a rich, enhancing pomegranate-based syrup, people think of grenadine as the leftover juice at the bottom of a jar of cherries,” he says. While the syrup is undeniably sweet, “so are most syrups and cordials that we use in cocktails all of the time,” he says. “It’s our job as bartenders to find the right amount of acidity to balance the drink, whether it’s with citrus or an alternative acid.” Garvin’s drink, using a combination of lemon juice and bright passion fruit puree, certainly provides that balance. “It’s a riff on a forgotten classic called Harry’s Pick Me Up, with a little more of a tropical feel,” he says. The recipe that provided his inspiration appears in the 1927 cocktail book “ Barflies & Cocktails ” by Harry McElhone and calls for shaking grenadine, brandy and lemon juice together, then topping it with Champagne. It’s crucial to use a good homemade grenadine in the drink, and Garvin’s recipe differs from a more often-used version in its simplicity, omitting the orange flower water. “ I’m pretty traditional,” he says. “It’s more important to make something classic really well than to add a bunch of different flavors to muddy something that’s already tasty.” How and Why to Use Grenadine in Your Drinks RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cognac'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Amaro Montenegro'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'passion fruit puree'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the cognac, amaro, lemon juice, passion fruit puree, grenadine and orange bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Top with Champagne.', 'Garnish with a lemon wheel.']",0,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brandy-sangaree/,Brandy Sangaree,Liquor.com,"Dating back to the late 1700s, this single-serving punch is the perfect open-ended drink. At its simplest, the Sangaree—a combination of fortified wine, sugar, water and grated nutmeg—is sweet, spice-forward and low in alcohol, but add a shot of your favorite brandy, and things get even more interesting. “This is such a fun and often-forgotten cocktail—[it’s] literally one of the earliest cocktails we have, dating back to 1774,” says Jason Sorbet, the beverage director at The Chloe in New Orleans, about the classic. According to Sorbet, Jerry Thomas’ 1862 “Bartenders Guide” dedicated an entire section to the Sangaree, but after Prohibition, the category fell out of fashion and never quite recovered. “Despite its recondite origins, I think the drink has remained in the back of our minds because of its simplicity,” he adds. When it comes to choosing the right brandy for your perfect Sangaree, there are countless options available, says Sorbet. “This cocktail is really a blank canvas: It can feature a brandy de Jerez, an Armagnac, a moscatel pisco, or something clean and eau-du-vie-like, such as a pear brandy or kirschwasser. These all work well in cocktails because they each have a clear essence of the fruits they are coming from, are typically on the more dry side and are usually high enough [in alcohol] to be treated the same way you would treat any other base spirit.” This is how to make the classic Brandy Sangaree at home. 8 Brandy Cocktails to Make in 5 Minutes or Less RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'port wine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the sugar and water into a mixing glass and stir until the sugar is dissolved.', 'Add the brandy and port wine, then add ice and stir.', 'Strain into a chilled Nick and Nora glass.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",23,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sazerac/,Sazerac,Dylan Garret,"The Sazerac is a close cousin to the Old Fashioned that traditionally consists of rye whiskey or brandy, bitters, sugar, and absinthe. The drink has reportedly been consumed in some form as far back as 1838, with the cocktail itself becoming trademarked in 1900 by the Sazerac Company. The Sazerac cocktail was crowned the official cocktail of New Orleans in 2008, though this designation was hardly needed—official status or not, the Sazerac has always belonged to the Crescent City. It’s believed that the first Sazeracs were made with French brandy—Sazerac de Forge et Fils Cognac, to be specific—rather than the now-standard rye whiskey. The earliest iteration of the cocktail is said to have originated from Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a pharmacist from Saint-Domingue, a French colony in what’s now modern-day Haiti. Peychaud relocated to New Orleans around the time of the Haitian Revolution, where he opened an apothecary that sold, among other things, his namesake Peychaud’s Bitters. Like other bitters of the time, Peychaud’s was originally marketed as a curative before making its way into the pantheon of great cocktail ingredients. The story goes that the businessman began to combine his bitters with brandy, sugar, and water, then marketed the resulting elixir as a health-aid. Eventually this cocktail grew in popularity to the point where locals sought it out whether they were sick or not, and the Sazerac cocktail was born. Around 1885, after Europe’s phylloxera epidemic decimated French vineyards, grape-based brandy was replaced with American rye whiskey as the Sazerac’s spirit of choice. Old Fashioned RELATED ARTICLE What’s the difference between a Sazerac and an Old Fashioned? Both the Sazerac and the Old Fashioned are based on a balance of whiskey, sugar, and bitters. However, they begin to diverge with the primary spirit. The Old Fashioned is known to traditionally call on bourbon as its base, while the modern Sazerac favors rye whiskey. Bourbon tends to be sweeter, while the rye offers a more peppery profile. The reason this choice works so well for the Sazerac has to do with the drink’s absinthe rinse. Absinthe’s notes of anise and licorice integrate well with the spicier profile of rye whiskey, adding depth without creating the illusion of additional sweetness, as can happen when anise spirits combine with bourbon. The combo also works well with Peychaud’s bitters, which tends to have a lighter and brighter profile than many other types of bitters, but still has a strong backbone of anise that’s accentuated through the absinthe rinse. Should a Sazerac use Cognac or Whiskey? Though the Sazerac started as a cognac-based cocktail, around the turn of the 20th century, due to supply issues, the recipe took a hard turn and pivoted firmed to rye whiskey, where it remains today. A well-made rye Sazerac is a delicious cocktail, full of kick and depth—though it can perhaps offer a bit too much kick for some tastes. Brandy or cognac, which are distilled from grapes, yield a Sazerac that’s fruity and floral, but lacks the modern iteration’s trademark spice notes which come from the use of grain spirit. This recipe opts to use the modern standard of rye whiskey as the base, though you can always experiment to see which you like best. Split your base to use equal parts of both cognac and rye whiskey can also create interesting new dimensions. Either way, you’ll end up with a drink that’s unmistakably New Orleans.","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sugar cube'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'cold water'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Peychaud’s bitters'}, {'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rinse a chilled rocks glass with absinthe, discarding any excess, and set aside.', 'In a mixing glass, muddle the sugar cube, water and the Peychaud’s bitters.', 'Add the rye whiskey, fill the mixing glass with ice and stir 15\xad–20 seconds, until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass.', 'Twist the lemon peel over the drink’s surface to express the peel’s oils, then garnish with the peel.']",690,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/eggnog/,Eggnog,Kevin Gray,"Eggnog, the creamy classic cocktail, is an essential part of the winter holidays. The recipe can vary depending on who’s making it, but the basic formula consists of eggs, sugar, milk and cream, plus a spirit. For the latter, most people turn to bourbon, rum or brandy, and some even elect to combine a couple spirits for oomph. Whichever route you choose, the potency of this drink will put a little more cheer in your holidays. Eggnog has a rich history with a lot of competing claims as to the origin of the drink, many of which get lost in an etymological debate. It’s possible the word derives from an Old English term for strong beer. Or maybe it comes from noggin, an outdated word used to describe a small cup. Or perhaps the name aligns with grogs, the term given to a variety of alcoholic drinks. That said, it’s believed that the first known use of the word “Eggnog” dates to around 1775, but it’s likely that the drink itself—or a version of it—preceded the term by a couple hundred years. And there seems to be consensus that Eggnog as we know it today is a culinary descendant of Posset , a warm ale punch with eggs that was consumed by European monks as far back as the 13th century. In Europe, ale was eventually replaced by sherry. By the time the drink reached American shores, colonists replaced sherry with what they had on hand: rum, rye whiskey and brandy. Those early iterations of the cocktail had staying power, and today, Eggnog is still widely consumed throughout the U.S. and even into Canada. It’s especially popular during the holiday season and can be consumed hot or cold, per the drinker’s preference—and perhaps depending on how brisk the weather outside is. Regardless of the cocktail’s origin or which spirit is best suited to the creamy mixture, everyone can agree on this: Eggnog is a universally delicious beverage with the capacity to improve any holiday gathering. And because it’s a good candidate for large batches, you’ll have plenty to keep everyone happy. 5 Tips for Making the Best Eggnog RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'eggs'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'whole milk'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with 3 tablespoons of the sugar until fluffy.', 'Stir in the milk, heavy cream and your spirit of choice.', 'In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar until soft peaks form.', 'Fold the egg whites into the yolk mixture.', 'Divide between four rocks glasses or punch or tea cups.', 'Garnish each with freshly grated nutmeg.']",162,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sea-breeze-cooler/,Sea Breeze Cooler,Liquor.com,"Conduct an informal poll, and drinkers will probably tell you that the Sea Breeze is a 1980s icon that belongs with other warm-weather cocktails of the era, like the Cape Codder . Then you’ll have to break the news that, while the ’80s certainly helped to immortalize the Sea Breeze in the modern cocktail canon, the fun-loving decade is about 50 years off from when the drink originated. Before the Sea Breeze, there was the Sea Breeze Cooler, a cocktail that dates back to at least 1930, when it appeared in Harry Craddock’s “ The Savoy Cocktail Book .” Placed in a section entitled “Coolers,” the drink contained dry gin and apricot brandy, plus lemon juice, grenadine and sparkling water. That’s right: The Sea Breeze got its start as a gin drink. It was only later that vodka muscled its way into the recipe, similar to how vodka also usurped gin in the Gimlet and other classic cocktails. Beyond the base spirit, apricot brandy and juice swap, the Sea Breeze Cooler is most notable for what it doesn’t include: cranberry juice. That’s because the vodka-and-cranberry rendition likely came about due to some clever marketing by Ocean Spray in the 1960s, when the brand began publishing recipe booklets to promote using cranberries in more foods and drinks. One of those drinks was called the Sea Breeze and featured cranberry juice. The trend stuck. The vodka, cranberry and grapefruit Sea Breeze is a fine drink, but the gin-based Sea Breeze Cooler is a tart, refreshing cocktail in its own right. Make the original to test its mettle against the better-known version, and see how gin, apricot brandy and lemon evoke breezy sentiments deserving of the name.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/vieux-carre/,Vieux Carré,Liquor.com,"New Orleans has played a significant role in cocktail culture over the past century-plus. The City That Care Forgot has been responsible for classics like the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz. Its contributions also include the Vieux Carré, which was first stirred to life during the 1930s by Walter Bergeron, a bartender at New Orleans’ legendary Carousel Bar (then known as the Swan Room) inside the Hotel Monteleone. Vieux Carré means “old square” in French and refers to the city’s French Quarter neighborhood. Like so many classic cocktails from that city, the recipe represents the crosscurrents of America at the time: brandy and liqueur from France, vermouth from Italy, and rye whiskey from just up the Mississippi. The Vieux Carré is at once boozy, sweet, bitter and smooth—in other words, it’s New Orleans in a glass. The drink features several strong ingredients. In most cases, rye or cognac could carry a cocktail on their own, but the Vieux Carré calls for both in a split-base technique that allows each component to shine. The rye provides muscular spice, while the cognac lends softer notes of fruit and florals. Sweet vermouth adds rich botanicals, while Bénédictine brings its distinct flavors of herbs, spices and honey. Finally, the bitters add structure and seasoning. Each element has a role to play; when combined, the ingredients meld seamlessly. This recipe comes from legendary bartender Dale DeGroff , aka King Cocktail. He subs the classic combination of Angostura and Peychaud’s bitters for his own pimento aromatic bitters, which bring similar accents of baking spices and anise to the drink. He also chooses George Dickel rye from Tennessee. But any good rye whiskey will do the job, so feel free to experiment with your favorite bottle. Today the Vieux Carré can be found on cocktail menus across the country, alongside other New Orleans classics like the Sazerac . If you find yourself in the French Quarter, don’t pass up a chance to drink one straight from the source. The cocktail is potent, but note that the Carousel Bar is famous for its revolving bar. So, if the room feels like it’s spinning, don’t worry: It is.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brandy-old-fashioned/,Brandy Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"A cocktail, by definition, includes a spirit, sugar, water and bitters—and those four ingredients are exactly what you’ll find in an Old Fashioned . It’s as classic as drinks get. Most Old Fashioneds are made with whiskey, but considering the Old Fashioned is more of a template than an exact recipe, today you will find the drink made with numerous spirits, from tequila to rum. But one variation is equally notable for its prescribed spirit and its geographical roots. The Brandy Old Fashioned, aka the Wisconsin Old Fashioned, is practically the state’s official drink. In addition to brandy, it calls for muddled fruit and a topper of lemon-lime soda. So, it’s not your great-great-grandfather’s Old Fashioned. Well, unless he’s from Wisconsin. Doctoring drinks with muddled fruit was a popular ploy during Prohibition that was used to mask the taste of subpar spirits. Add enough fruit and sugar to a cocktail, and anything is bound to become palatable. In the case of the Old Fashioned, the trick stuck around and remained popular in Wisconsin, even in the 21st century as modern bartenders reclaimed the classic no-fruit recipe. As for the brandy, it’s a product of the many Wisconsinites who emigrated from Europe over the centuries, bringing a taste for brandy with them. Today, the Brandy Old Fashioned is tied to Wisconsin more than any other locale, and the fruit and soda are nonnegotiable. Visit a bar in the Badger State, and this sweet, bubbly version will be placed before you. It may not be the Old Fashioned you’re used to, but it’s an important piece of cocktail history all the same. 8 Brandy Cocktails to Make in 5 Minutes or Less RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slices'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied or maraschino cherries'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sugar cube'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': '7UP'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied or maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bitters, orange slices, cherries and sugar cube to an Old Fashioned glass and muddle to combine.', 'Add ice to fill the glass, then add the brandy.', 'Top with the 7UP, Sprite or club soda, and stir to chill.', 'Garnish with a skewered cherry and an orange slice.']",159,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tom-jerry/,Tom & Jerry,David Wondrich,"It’s not easy to figure out how many calories are in a little mug of Tom & Jerry. Sure, the alcohol is a known quantity, with the couple ounces of cognac and dark rum clocking in at about 120 calories total. And the splash of hot whole milk, the only kind you want to even consider for a Tom & Jerry, is another 20. I don’t think cloves, nutmeg and allspice have calories, so you don’t have to worry about them. Which leaves the batter. When you take a dozen eggs, beat the whites to stiff peaks and the yolks with rum and a couple of pounds of sugar and then fold them together, that comes to a little more than 4,000 calories. But fortunately, that bowl of batter will make three- or four-dozen Tom & Jerrys, which means each drink contains a mere 250 calories or so. To put that into perspective, it’s equal to a pint of real beer, and people manage to choke those down OK. The History and Secrets of the Tom & Jerry RELATED ARTICLE The reason I’ve spent so much time dwelling on nutritional information is that the Tom & Jerry’s perceived caloric throw-weight is the basis of the only possible objection anyone could have to it as a holiday drink. This ancient beverage—it goes back to England in the 1820s—is otherwise so delicious, so warming and so conducive to holiday cheer that, if not for the fear its ingredient list engenders, the Tom & Jerry bowl would be broken out every Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year’s by all Americans, rather than just the fearless souls in the upper Midwest.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brandy-alexander/,Brandy Alexander,Gary Regan,"This recipe for the Brandy Alexander was originally published on Liquor.com in 2011 by the late, great Gary “Gaz” Regan. The Brandy Alexander was a darned popular drink when I was working Upper East Side bars in Manhattan during the ’70s, and when carefully crafted, it can be a quality quaff. But where did it come from? It’s obviously a pimped-out version of the classic—but largely forgotten—Alexander cocktail and mixes brandy instead of gin with creme de cacao and cream. But whoever eighty-sixed the British gin and welcomed the French cognac to the party is, I believe, lost to history. One of the earliest known printed recipes for the Alexander can be found in Hugo Ensslin’s 1916 book Recipes for Mixed Drinks . The cocktail, according to historian Barry Popik, was likely born at Hotel Rector, New York City’s premier pre-Prohibition lobster palace. The bartender there, a certain Troy Alexander, created his eponymous concoction in order to serve a white drink at a dinner celebrating Phoebe Snow. Phoebe Snow, I should explain, was a fictitious character used in an advertising campaign for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The company wanted to get the message across that it powered its locomotives with anthracite, a clean-burning variety of coal. The ads emphasized this by showing Ms. Snow traveling while wearing a snow-white dress. Getting back to the Brandy Alexander, I should note that it was first known as the Alexander #2. Want to know the secret to making the drink? Go heavy on the brandy and light on the sweet stuff. My recipe is a decent jumping-off point; you can play with it to make it your own.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/classic-sangria/,Classic Sangria,Dylan Garret,"Sangria is the great democratizer of wine . While the wine industry has long been known for a certain stodginess, with self-styled enthusiasts drawing lines in the sand over everything from serving temperatures to shapes of glassware , this fruit-based punch has always been a drink in which anything goes. A combination of wine, fruit, and often ingredients like fresh fruit juices, liquors, liqueurs, and sweeteners, Sangria has been made as far back as the Middle Ages. Though it is thought to originate around modern-day Spain and Portugal on the Iberian Peninsula, the practice of blending fermented grapes with other ingredients to create a wine cocktail goes back to the Greeks, Romans, Phoenicians—effectively to the invention of wine itself. Sangria is commonly made with red wine, but you’ll increasingly see white wine , rosé , and sparkling options. The anything-goes format means that Sangria can range wildly in quality, but choosing the right ingredients can transform  the drink from a basic fruit punch into something truly special. Let’s break down what goes into a great Sangria, starting with the most important ingredient: the wine. How to Choose Wine for a Sangria While almost any style of wine can be used to make Sangria, here we’re going to focus on a classic, red wine-based version. It’s true that you probably don’t want to waste a 2016 Barolo on a pitcher of Sangria, but if you stick to only poorly made bargain-basement wine, you may ruin your drink before even adding other ingredients. No amount of fruit or sugar will cover for a truly terrible wine. Instead of price, focus on certain wine styles and look for something within your budget. When choosing a red wine for Sangria, it’s best to look for something that’s dry, high in acid, and low in tannins. It should also display fresher bright red fruit as opposed to darker, cooked fruits. Here’s why. Dry Wine: Since Sangria includes added sugar and fresh fruit (which itself is loaded with natural sugars), you’ll have an easier time bringing balance to a dry wine rather than starting with a wine that brings its own residual sugars. High-Acid Wine: A wine that’s higher in acidity will show a more tart and zesty profile. As with any cocktail, acidity is used to balance sugar—think how lemon or lime is used in mixed drinks to even out simple syrups or liqueurs. A high acid wine acts as a counterweight to Sangria’s added sugar, ensuring you have a punch that’s refreshing, not flabby. Low-Tannin Wine: Tannins are a group of bitter and astringent compounds that create a drying effect on the palate in certain red wines. This is different from the “dry” term we use in regard to a wine or drink simply being low in sugar, but rather a sense of the tongue and mouth drying out after a sip. Tannins are notoriously difficult to manage when adding wine to any sort of cocktail—when mixed with other ingredients these compounds can quickly morph into unpleasant bitterness that will cause the entire drink to taste off. As such, you’ll want to look for red wines that have spent a minimal amount of time in oak. Bright Red Fruit: Here, there’s a bit of wiggle room based on personal preferences, as it’s possible to make a delicious Sangria with wine that presents darker fruit like plum, black currant, or jam. However, if you’re looking to make Sangria for warmer months, or simply something that’s more immediately crowd-pleasing, wines that are more prominent in lighter red fruit notes are typically more accessible and easier to mix with. Think cherries, strawberries, cranberries, and raspberries. The 15 Best Red Wines to Drink RELATED ARTICLE The Best Types of Red Wine for Sangria So what types of wine fall into these categories? While there’s endless variation within grapes and styles, this cheat sheet includes some of the most commonly found red grape varieties that will yield a great Sangria, very loosely ordered from lighter to more full-bodied. Look for these on a wine label and choose based on your personal preference. Gamay/Beaujolais: Tart, acidic, and fruit forward Pinot Noir: Light-bodied, easy to find at a good price Zweigelt: Tart, fruity, acidic, often cherry or cassis-forward Grenache/Garnacha: Medium-bodied, more rounded fruit, classic choice for Spanish-style Sangria Barbera: High acidity, lighter tannins for those with less time in barrel, strawberry and sour cherry notes Tempranillo: Classic full-bodied Spanish/Portuguese grape, darker, notes of spice There’s a lot of variation, but part of the beauty of Sangria is in how customizable it is based on taste—feel free to throw out any of the above guidelines and use your favorite red wine. It’s Sangria, you’re supposed to get a little weird with it. 9 Red Wine Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'tablespoons', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange, cut into wedges'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'apple, cored and diced'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon, cut into wedges'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'bottle', 'ingredient': 'dry red wine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a large pitcher, add the sugar, orange, apple and lemon and muddle for 30 seconds.', 'Add the brandy and orange juice and muddle again for 30 seconds.', 'Add the red wine and stir.', 'Allow the Sangria to rest for at least two hours before serving, for flavors to fully integrate.', 'Serve in a red wine glass with ice, and garnish with an orange wheel.']",119,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/between-the-sheets/,Between the Sheets,Liquor.com,"The Sidecar is a pre-Prohibition classic that features cognac, orange liqueur and fresh lemon juice. It has stood the test of time and remains in heavy rotation today at bars and in homes around the world. If you like the Sidecar, you should meet its lesser-known cousin, the Between the Sheets. Conventional belief credits the cocktail to Harry’s New York Bar in Paris, where acclaimed bartender and author Harry MacElhone, supposedly created it in the 1920s. MacElhone has contributed several other classics to the boozy realm, including the White Lady and the Old Pal , so drinkers are forever in his debt. The Between the Sheets starts as a Sidecar but diverges with a measure of light rum and skips the customary sugared rim. This two-spirit base lends complexity, merging the rich oak and fruit notes of cognac with the dry, tropical notes of light rum. Enlist high-quality bottles for each, but there’s no need to go overboard. Pick up a V.S. or V.S.O.P. cognac and an unaged or lightly aged rum, and you’ll be golden. A rich triple sec with some heft will round the edges of the spirits and provide a touch of bitter-orange sweetness. As with most classic cocktails, slightly different versions of the original recipe have evolved over the years. This particular one comes from Allen Katz, the co-founder of New York Distilling Company and a leading expert on spirits and cocktails. He follows the classic Between the Sheets formula, combining equal parts rum, cognac and triple sec with a quarter-part fresh lemon juice for a potent drink—and that potency is likely the reason behind its provocative name. Some barkeeps prefer a bit more lemon for additional acidity, so customize the ratios to your liking. If you want to add flair, follow Katz’s lead and flame an orange peel over the surface of the cocktail for an aromatic hint of citrus oils.

This two-ingredient cocktail is an easy-to-make crowd pleaser, especially for those who like an exaggerated garnish. Because the Horse’s Neck gets its singular name from its long coiled lemon peel that snakes around the inside of the glass. While often regarded as a Derby-day drink, the Horse’s Neck is quite versatile. Nicole Fas, the beverage director and bar manager at La Pícara in Santurce, Puerto Rico, recommends this cocktail as a warm weather pick-me-up, preferably on a beach. At times, though, she opts for a more island-inspired riff: “Instead of whiskey or brandy, I switch for aged rum (preferably Puerto Rican) and squeeze a lime in it instead of the lemon peel,” she shares. Fas’ variation is closer to Simon Ford’s Lincoln Club Cooler , a lighter and more approachable version of the Dark ’n Stormy , and is equally simple to make. 20 Rum Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ginger ale'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the whiskey into a Collins glass over ice.', 'Top with ginger ale.', 'Garnish with a long strip of lemon peel.']",60,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/stinger/,Stinger,Liquor.com,"The Stinger is a pre-Prohibition drink composed simply of cognac and white crème de menthe. The odd couple is quite a pair, producing a cocktail that’s sweet, strong, minty and refreshing—the ideal interplay for an after-dinner nightcap . The exact origins of the Stinger are murky, but it appeared in print at least as far back as 1914, when Jacques Straub included it in his book “Drinks.” In the book “ Imbibe! ,” drinks historian and author David Wondrich reports that the Stinger is most famously associated with Reginald Vanderbilt—yes, of the Vanderbilts. A 1923 Ohio newspaper article even credited him with the invention, noting that he was fond of serving them to guests at his home beginning two decades prior. So, it seems we can thank ol’ Reggie for giving us this classic. Vanderbilt’s taste for the Stinger solidified its high-society bonafides, and for decades the drink was associated with the upper class. It even appeared in the 1956 movie “High Society” starring Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby, and James Bond drinks one in the 1956 novel “Diamonds Are Forever.” The Stinger remained popular in the United States, inside and outside of pop culture, until about the 1970s when it fell out of favor. Stinger recipes vary in proportion, with some drinkers preferring a drier version made with less crème de menthe. Stinger recipes also typically call for the drink to be shaken, an anomaly for cocktails comprising all spirits. This recipe hews classic, in proportion and technique, stirring two parts cognac with one part crème de menthe before straining it into a rocks glass. Serve the drink over crushed ice for an extra dose of refreshment, and you will render the perfect digestif. 8 Can’t-Miss Cognac Classics to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cognac'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white creme de menthe'}]","['Add the cognac and white crème de menthe into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over crushed ice.']",143,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/french-connection/,French Connection,Liquor.com,"The French Connection is a two-part drink that first appeared in the early 1970s and was titled for the 1971 Gene Hackman film of the same name. The cocktail’s creator is unknown, so it’s unclear who to thank for this tasty concoction. The French Connection combines cognac and amaretto—a sweet Italian liqueur made from almonds and stone-fruit pits—in an ostensibly simple duo that tastes more complex than the recipe indicates. Cognac provides a bright and fruity base that harmonizes seamlessly with the amaretto liqueur’s trademark fruit and almond notes. There are no rules when choosing your cognac, and the drink can be made with a young VS, a slightly older VSOP or even an XO. Younger cognacs supply fresher and more fruit-forward flavors, while the older expressions bring oak barrel accents like vanilla and spice. The French Connection is similar to the Godfather , another ’70s cocktail named for a famous film. The only difference is the base spirit. Instead of cognac, the Godfather enlists whiskey—usually scotch, but occasionally bourbon. Both cocktails became popular after-dinner drinks upon their debuts, offering the one-two punch of strong spirit with sweet liqueur that tastes particularly good after a meal. This recipe pairs one and a half ounces of cognac with one ounce of amaretto, yielding a delicious albeit fairly sweet cocktail. Many bartenders and French Connection drinkers make a drier recipe in a two-to-one construction of cognac and amaretto. Feel free to experiment and see which ratio you like best. If you really want to embrace the spirit of the drink, mix one alongside Gene Hackman’s character, Popeye Doyle.

https://www.liquor.com/melon-cheese-pepper-cocktail-recipe-5324380,"Melon, Cheese & Pepper",Tyler Zielinski,"Cheese in cocktails? If you’re skeptical, you wouldn’t be alone. But it’s an ingredient being used more and more by innovative bartenders. When done well, it can impart texture and depth to a drink, as well as a range of flavors from milky to savory, depending on the type of cheese used and the technique employed to draw out its characteristics. At Two Schmucks in Barcelona, bar manager Juliette Larrouy has worked with a variety of cheeses in drinks across a few menus. Her Melon, Cheese & Pepper cocktail is inspired by her upbringing in the southeast of France, where melon, balls of mozzarella cheese, and black pepper were often served as a pre-meal hors d’oeuvre. The cocktail, which is split into a cantaloupe-flavored base comprising gin, dry vermouth, and cantaloupe cordial, and a top layer of mozzarella foam—a form that captures the essence of the cheese and its distinct milky texture—strikes a unique balance: exciting and approachable for casual bar-goers, yet “nerdy” enough for cocktail sophisticates. The cocktail is made without any citrus juices; the acidity, which lifts the fresh cantaloupe flavor, comes from the vermouth as well as the citric acid powder that’s mixed into the cantaloupe cordial. “We chose a milky soft cheese made from mozzarella—stracciatella, the inside of the burrata—for the Melon, Cheese & Pepper cocktail because it’s playful and not overly intense in a cocktail,” says Larrouy, emphasizing the importance of not making the cheesy component of drinks too intense, aware that it could be off-putting to guests. “The cheese foam adds a nice contrast in texture from the melon cocktail base, much like the dish from my childhood.” The team tried many techniques for integrating the mozzarella component, and ended up going with a foam “because it was the best method for showcasing the delicate ingredient,” she says.

https://www.liquor.com/manhatta-astoria-cocktail-recipe-5248266,Manhatta Astoria,Caroline Hatchett,"The classic Astoria cocktail, named for the New York City hotel where it was created, is a simple mix of Old Tom gin and extra-dry vermouth in the proportions of a Reverse Martini . There’s nothing simple about the version of the classic that appears on the menu at Manhatta in NYC, however. This labor-intensive cocktail retains the original’s formula of two ounces vermouth to an ounce of gin, but incorporates a number of contemporary flourishes. It calls for multiple gins and vermouths, an aromatic tincture, and a pickled garnish plus a bit of the pickling liquid; the entire mix gets infused with chrysanthemum flowers. It’s the creation of Manhatta’s head bartender, Cameron Winkelman, who was inspired to use a blend of four gins he was introduced to while working at The Polynesian , which used the blend in its Zombie . There, rum aficionado Brian Miller would tell him, “What one rum can’t do, three can,” according to Winkelman. “I find you can apply that principle to gins,” he says. “If you find one flat or static, you can add another to change the flavor while still holding true to what each brings to the table.” In this case, the gin blend, with its honeyed-floral-citrus notes and an alcohol boost from the Perry’s Tot, accents the drink’s modern additions. The drink is prebatched, so although it’s incredibly complicated to pull together, it couldn’t be easier to serve. The quantities given are for one cocktail but can be scaled up as desired to make multiple servings. Even though a blend of gins is ideal in this cocktail, Winkelman cautions against blending for the sake of it. “Certain gins may taste bad together. You have to train your palate to find the differences and balance. I’m not even perfect at it,” he says.

https://www.liquor.com/soft-focus-cocktail-recipe-5248263,Soft Focus,Caroline Hatchett,"So-called “split-base” cocktails are nothing new in the bartending world. Bartenders have long been dividing the spirituous base of their cocktails between two spirits, or “splitting” the base. But the rise of doing so with gin or gin-like spirits is a relatively recent phenomenon. “I’ve always loved using Barr Hill in a split-base cocktail, even with other types of gin,” says Sam Nelis, the beverage director at Caledonia Spirits in Vermont, which makes Barr Hill gin. “It has such a rich, round, botanical note from the use of raw honey that it comes through in cocktails even if it’s in a smaller amount,” he says. “It’s a great gin to share the spotlight in cocktails because it still finds a way to shine.” As an example, Nelis points to this cocktail, created by Jeff Baumann at The Great Northern in Burlington, Vermont, in 2018. It splits the base between Barr Hill’s honey-tinged gin and genever, a spirit that’s often described as a cross between gin and whiskey. To this mix, he adds Cocchi Americano , an aromatized wine similar to a vermouth, with a citrusy and slightly bitter flavor, and a fruity and floral pear eau de vie. It’s all finished off with orange bitters and a few drops of saline to accent the complex flavors . The resulting cocktail is clearly a relative of a Martini, but much more flavorful and complex.

At first glance, it seems rather like a 50/50 Martini with an extra component: The apricot eau de vie is likely the first thing in the ingredients list to catch your eye. But the specific gin and vermouth called for render the cocktail a gentler version of the classic, as well as a contemporary rendition of the Tuxedo No. 2 . The Gin Blossom calls for Plymouth gin, which brings its own distinct style of full-bodied softness, and the slightly sweet and vanilla-tinged Martini bianco vermouth rather than the standard dry. Both ingredients work in tandem to complement the gently fruity and floral eau de vie. It all adds up to an elegant sipper, less bracing than a typical Martini but clearly a direct descendent of the classic. It’s as perfect an appetite-whetting aperitif as it is an exquisite nightcap.

https://www.liquor.com/army-navy-cocktail-recipe-5225039,Army & Navy,Liquor.com,"You might not picture today’s tailgaters clanking coupe glasses, but by some accounts, the Army & Navy was invented to honor the centuries-old football game between the United States military and naval academies. Like many classics, however, this bright and nutty mix of gin, lemon juice, and orgeat has a vague backstory: The cocktail has also been tied to the The Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C., a members-only officers’ club where the Daiquiri was first served in the U.S. The club has no details on the Army & Navy’s origins but likely helped popularize the drink, which remains on its cocktail menu today. However it came to be, the Army & Navy—essentially a Gin Sour riff that swaps simple syrup for almond-based orgeat—was first recorded in David Embury’s 1948 book The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks . Yet Embury didn’t recommend it as written: one part lemon juice, one part orgeat, two parts gin. “I have given the original recipe which, to my mind, is horrible,” he wrote. Embury suggested instead a boozier drink, using his 1:2:8 formula (one part sweet, two parts sour, eight parts base). The version below produces a more balanced take, dialing down the orgeat slightly from the original and adding aromatic bitters for an ideal mix of sweet, sour, and boozy. The secret ingredient to this cocktail’s nutty complexity is the creamy and sweet almond syrup orgeat , which is typically made with blanched almonds, sugar, and orange flower or rose water. The opaque and gently floral syrup started appearing in cocktails in the 19th century, and by the 1940s became a supporting character in many Tiki drinks, lending its almond-tinged nuttiness to classics such as the Mai Tai and the Saturn . In this cocktail, orgeat works as a sweetener and imparts an unexpected richness to the basic sour format. Opt for a high-quality bottle, or you can even make your own and switch up the base ingredient with hazelnuts or pistachios. A London Dry gin gives the drink botanical notes, but as with a classic Gin Sour, you can swap in a softer bottle like Old Tom or Plymouth if you prefer; you can also play with ingredient quantities to your choosing, adding more lemon juice for tartness or orgeat for creamy sweetness. Whatever the drink’s true backstory may be, Army-Navy game day is as good an excuse as any to shake one up. And no matter which team you’re rooting for, everyone wins with this recipe.

https://www.liquor.com/silver-fizz-cocktail-recipe-5224789,Silver Fizz,David Wondrich,"The world’s spirits are like any one of us. They’ve each got their likes and dislikes, and their friends and enemies. Some of them are solitary sorts, not much given to mixing with their peers. Baijiu might be a fascinating and heady spirit when sipped in little (but frequently refilled) thimble-cups, but just try fixing cocktails with it. It even makes a lousy Old Fashioned , and nothing makes a lousy Old Fashioned. Others are utterly, unabashedly promiscuous. That vodka? It’ll mix with anything . Like the rest of us, though, most varieties of hooch fall somewhere in between. Rye loves sweet vermouth, will mix with brandy if it has to and doesn’t get along at all with dry vermouth. Scotch tolerates sweet vermouth, has a secret affection for all things orange and—well, that’s about it. Rum and lime enjoy true, undying love, never to be parted, but rum plays around on the side with brandy, bringing a wild funkiness to that spirit’s smoothness. At the same time, lime has a little thing going on with tequila, which in turn engages in a torrid fling with the sweet lushness that is crème de cassis. Among the strangest relationships is the interspecies ménage à trois pursued by gin, lemon juice, and egg white. Here you have gin, a lean, odoriferous sort of liquor with a long and sometimes distinguished pedigree—and yet, it’s an easy, casual mixer. Over here you have the egg white, soft and yielding. And lemon juice—well, everybody knows how much lemon juice likes the sauce, and it’s been cohabitating with egg whites since at least 1862, when Jerry Thomas suggested that “lemonade will be much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up with it.” Combine all three and you have something greater than the sum of its parts: The gin loses its tough, bitter edge, the lemon juice gets brighter and more fragrant, and the egg white takes on an unexpected light, frothy opacity. The first actual drink to make full use of this raffish trio was the Silver Fizz, an early variation on the Gin Fizz. The Silver Fizz pops up in New York (and, soon after, everywhere else) in the early 1880s, a scant half-decade after we first see the plain version appear. “A body of creamy liquid topped by about an inch of frothy foam,” as the Chicago Tribune described it in 1883, this “very tempting” quick refresher rapidly gained a reputation, in an age before Alka-Seltzer, as the morning stomach-settler par excellence. Add a splash of cream and a couple drops of orange flower water and shake it until all the ice has melted, as Henry C. “Carl” Ramos would start doing at his New Orleans bar in 1887, and you have something so delectable as to invite comparisons to Mediterranean sunsets, mountain meadows and poems of old. His Ramos Gin Fizz is still a popular cocktail on menus around the country. Some 40 years later, Harry Craddock, at the Savoy Hotel in London, would substitute Cointreau for the sugar in the Silver Fizz and take the combination in a slightly different direction with his White Lady , perhaps the greatest of all art-deco cocktails.

https://www.liquor.com/black-negroni-cocktail-recipe-5220348,Black Negroni,Kara Newman,"We’ve seen all kinds of Negroni variations , but the Black Negroni might just be the most dramatic take on the classic three-parts cocktail. Bartenders have delighted in mixing shockingly dark cocktails for years, and now, thanks to a wave of nearly-noir spirits , they no longer have to rely on harmful ingredients like black charcoal, which has been linked to various health risks . It was only a matter of time before distillers embraced the dark side: Pink gins had a moment last year, and the “Goth food” trend has taken off in the food world, giving us black burger buns and inky ice cream. Now, distillers are painting spirits black—or often more muted shades on the spectrum like faded charcoal and garnet—with natural ingredients like cocoa nibs, black carrot root, and butterfly pea powder. The star of this cocktail is a New Zealand import, Scapegrace Black gin, which made its debut stateside in September 2021. Butterfly pea powder imparts a deep blackberry hue, which transforms into a light lavender shade with the addition of tonic water or citrus. It’s not all gimmicks, though: In addition to juniper and butterfly pea powder, which are sourced from Southeast Asia, the gin features botanicals including local sweet potato, aronia berries, pineapple, and saffron. This recipe comes from Justin Carpena of Tamborim Bar & Grill, a Brazilian restaurant in Jersey City, New Jersey. He relies on the classic Negroni equal-parts format, but employs a few key variations: Using Scapegrace instead of a traditional colorless gin and the alpine liqueur Bitter Truth EXR in lieu of Campari enhances the cocktail’s dark hue and adds extra herbaceousness. Carpena also splits the typical sweet vermouth with the alpine liqueur Dolin Génépy le Chamois, then steeps the mixture with mango pineapple chili black tea leaves for an even darker color and enhanced herbaceousness. Lastly, he amps up the drama with a torched orange wheel garnish. One sip and you might just be tempted to join the dark side. What’s Behind the Recent Wave of Noir Spirits?

https://www.liquor.com/tuxedo-number-2-cocktail-recipe-5217855,Tuxedo No. 2,Dylan Garret,"The original Tuxedo cocktail—comprised of gin, sherry, and orange bitters—was likely first created in the late-1800s at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New York City. It was named after Tuxedo Park, a planned residential community in New York’s Hudson Valley, whose namesake resort, the Tuxedo Club, included Waldorf-Astoria owner William Waldorf Astor as a member. Both the drink and community (as well as the formalwear that became synonymous with them) took their name from a native Lenape word, “tucseto” or “tùkwsitu,” associated with the area. Though a well-liked cocktail within the Martini rubric, the original Tuxedo was succeeded by the Tuxedo No. 2, which arguably surpassed the original in popularity. The revised iteration omitted the original’s sherry, while contributing a touch of maraschino liqueur and an absinthe rinse to add sweetness and aromatics. Despite its name, the Tuxedo No. 2 actually bears more similarities to the Turf Club , another turn-of-the-century Martini variation that utilized maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and orange bitters. Both cocktails are featured alongside each other in the 1900 edition of Harry Johnson’s Bartender’s Manual , which remains one of the earliest known print references of the Tuxedo No. 2. The Tuxedo No. 2 became largely forgotten over the following century. However, at the turn of the millennium, as pre-Prohibition cocktails began to gain prominence in cocktail bars across the country again, renowned institutions like Douglas Room in San Francisco and the now-shuttered Flora Bar in New York City resurrected the drink. This particular version was the Tuxedo No. 2 recipe used at Flora Bar. Old Tom gin is the backbone of the classic, but Plymouth gin makes for a more modern variation. Although it isn’t quite as soft as Old Tom, Plymouth strikes a good balance between the sweeter and rounder Old Tom style, and the bracing dryness of a London Dry gin.","[{'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '2 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Plymouth gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blanc vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rinse a chilled cocktail glass with the absinthe and discard any excess.', 'Add all other ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass.', 'Garnish with a brandied cherry and an orange twist.']",28,gin

The tiny orange citrus fruit, although packed full of tart flavor some describe as between a lime and a tangerine, yields almost no juice.

Fortunately, there are other ways of incorporating the fruit’s unique flavor into your drinks. This recipe from bar star Naren Young uses an innovative one. A riff on the iconic Breakfast Martini created by London bartender Salvatore Calabrese, Young’s recipe calls for making a kumquat marmalade, cooking the fruit into the classic jam-like treat along with a variety of spices, and incorporating a heaping bar spoon of the marmalade into the drink. When it’s shaken with gin, orange liqueur, and freshly squeezed lemon juice, the resulting cocktail features layers of citrus flavors.

https://www.liquor.com/perfect-martini-cocktail-recipe-5213928,Perfect Martini,Kathryn Maier,"When the classic Brooklyn restaurant Gage & Tollner was recently resurrected by the team of Ben Schneider, Sohui Kim, and bar pro St. John Frizell, it was decided that its drink list would feature only cocktails that had appeared on the menu of the restaurant’s original incarnation. The team knew they wanted to focus on Martinis, covering many of the standard bases—vodka, gin, classic, dirty—and decided to throw in a variation not often seen on contemporary menus: the Perfect Martini. Like the Perfect Manhattan , its name refers not (just) to the fact that it's a perfectly made Martini, but to its relatively uncommon recipe, which calls for splitting the vermouth : using both sweet and dry styles in equal, or ""perfect,"" proportions. The Gage & Tollner team has tweaked this formula to, well, perfection. Its version skews more vermouth-heavy than you might expect: Their drink is essentially a type of Reverse Martini , containing more vermouth than gin. And it calls for the unexpected addition of a bit of maraschino liqueur for a touch of nuanced sweetness. “For us, this little extra touch brightened the drink up; it made it distinct from the other Martinis on the list,” says Stephen Bielawski, who was the head bartender at Gage & Tollner before heading upstairs from the restaurant to helm the newly opened tropical bar Sunken Harbor Club . The split bitters are another unique touch: The Gage & Tollner house bitters used in the drink are a 50-50 blend of Angostura aromatic bitters and Bogart’s Bitters from The Bitter Truth, said to have been reverse-engineered from a Jerry Thomas-era bottle. According to Bielawski, however, the cocktail will turn out just fine if you use either type of bitters on its own. The decision to make some of these very specific tweaks, or use, say, multiple ingredients when a single one would be perfectly adequate, came out of the pandemic, he says. “With the boom in at-home bartending over the long sequestering, I think it’s fun when a bar does something that you either can’t do at home or is too much of a pain.” For instance, the restaurant’s Manhattan employs six ingredients: two ryes, two sweet vermouths, and two types of bitters. “It really is over-the-top,” he admits. “These little touches are easy for us to do, but they give an extra layer to the drinks for people who are already used to the standard version.” The Perfect Martini is a phenomenally food-friendly drink, ideal with the steaks and hearty old-fashioned seafood dishes the restaurant serves. That was intentional, according to Bielawski, who says that every cocktail on the menu was considered in terms of what dishes it would go well with—“Especially the Martinis; those are such excellent food cocktails,” he says. The Perfect Martini’s inclusion of sweet vermouth allows it to match with some dishes that other Martini variations can’t, because the extra flavor lets it stand up to some of the richer items. “I really think it goes with any of the more savory, steakhouse-y options on the menu,” says Bielawski. The cocktail is dry enough to be enjoyed as an appetite-whetting aperitif, while the touch of sweetness from the sweet vermouth and bit of maraschino makes it suitable for after the meal as well. “You can have it with really any course,” he says. It’s a cocktail that has truly earned its name in multiple ways. “I love the name Perfect Martini,” says Bielawski. “Obviously, it comes from the use of both sweet and dry vermouth. But to me, it’s an actually perfect Martini, because it’s the most adaptable of the Martini family.” Perfect Manhattan 415 ratings","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Beefeater gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dolin dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cocchi Torino sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'Luxardo maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",31,gin

It’s derided by others for exactly the same reason; those drinkers call its disparate notes too strong or “spiky.” Some bartenders get around the latter argument by playing with the proportions; the cocktail’s gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur and lime juice are normally added in equal parts, but a little more gin and lime and a little less of the other two ingredients make for a softer drink. Jake Larragoite, the food and beverage manager at The Apothecary Lounge in Albuquerque, takes a different approach entirely: He swaps out the green Chartreuse, instead using green creme de menthe. “Equal parts gin, maraschino liqueur, creme de menthe and lime juice gives you a fresh, vibrant cocktail with just enough sweet and sour to please the palate,” Larragoite says of his take on the drink. “If you learn what makes creme de menthe unique and begin to appreciate it for what it is, you can start to use it with purpose” What the #$@!

Just look at the Pimm’s Fizz, a fun and frothy cocktail combining Pimm’s No. 1 with London dry gin, fresh lime juice, grenadine, ginger syrup, egg white and sparkling water. It brings all the refreshment you want from a Pimm’s Cup but lends additional flavors via the rich grenadine and spicy ginger. “I like to use Pimm’s as a great herbal note in cocktails,” says Matthew Betts, the beverage manager for Fielding’s , Sky Shed and Tune Up , all in Bozeman, Montana. Betts says the liqueur’s best attribute is its versatility, though it can be challenging to consider it poured into anything but the traditional fruit cup. And while others maintain that Pimm’s No. 1 should be the primary component of a cocktail, Betts believes it’s better when it shares a split base with another spirit. That’s what you see here, as Pimm’s shares the spotlight with Beefeater gin. The split base is enhanced by that uncommon mix of spicy and sweet, plus the egg white, which gives the whole affair a silky texture. “The spicy bite from ginger married with the herbal notes found in Pimm’s creates such an interesting yet balanced flavor,” says Betts.

But have you tried a Gin Sour yet? It’s essentially the same drink with a different spirit swapped in—a light, refreshing and mildly botanical sipper for any season or occasion. The classic sour format, dating back to the mid-19th century, calls for a spirit, lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener. A frothing element such as egg white or aquafaba (the liquid you’d usually drain from a can of chickpeas) is optional and adds a lovely layer of foamy texture atop the drink, which you can then decorate with bitters. If this format sounds familiar, it’s because many drinks follow it, such as the Gimlet —essentially a Gin Sour that calls for lime juice rather than lemon—and the Daiquiri and Tommy’s Margarita. (You’ll want to omit the egg white in all three of these drinks, though.) This recipe calls for a London dry gin, but feel free to switch it up with different types if you like; an Old Tom gin or even genever, gin's Dutch predecessor, both work well.

In this Martini variation, dried rose petals heighten the floral aromatics of Lillet Blanc. For the base of the cocktail, Wolf calls for an “aromatic gin.” Generally, that refers to a gin with more than just a strong juniper presence. Those with an especially heavy floral profile would complement the rose-infused Lillet Blanc. The most obvious of these is Hendrick’s, which has remained a popular gin for decades now due to its floral, cucumber aromatics. But there are others: The Botanist, from Islay in Scotland, offers a bouquet of 22 botanicals including clover, heather, chamomile, wood sage and lemon balm; St. George’s Terroir Gin from Alameda, California, evokes the coastal wilds of California with coastal sage, Douglas fir and California bay laurel; and Empress 1908 gin has elements of rose and citrus, though its blue color might make the Killer Queen murky. Lillet Blanc is a bittersweet aperitif based on a now-lost historic liqueur called Kina Lillet; its most famous application is in James Bond’s signature Martini, the Vesper . Those who want their drink a bit more bitter and a touch less sweet could, instead, use Cocchi Americano, a similar kind of fortified wine that is likely more akin to Kina Lillet in that it includes quinine, the ingredient that adds the telltale bitterness to tonic water. Either way, the liquid needs 24 hours to be infused with dried rose petals. For a bit of sweetness and some additional botanical depth, the drink also gets a quarter ounce of Benedictine . This brandy-based herbal spirit is made with a closely guarded secret recipe that includes 27 herbs and spices, and is sweetened with honey. Because of its assertive nature, a little goes a mile, so don’t use more than is called for. Finally, the drink receives four full dashes of Angostura bitters. As dashes can vary in volume depending on the amount left in the bottle, use a careful hand, and taste before adding too much.

https://www.liquor.com/50-50-birthday-cocktail-recipe-5070388,50/50 Birthday,Céline Bossart,"New York City bartender Jena Ellenwood created this drink for a virtual happy hour co-founded by writer and spirits entrepreneur Jackie Summers, digital marketing pro Daniella Veras and Cocktail & Sons CEO Lauren Myerscough. The happy hour series brought together members of the hospitality scene and guests and provided an opportunity for host bartenders to earn tips from attendees. It also resulted in many fine cocktails, like the 50/50 Birthday. The traditional 50/50 Martini features gin and dry vermouth in equal proportions and is a much softer, lighter cocktail than the Dry Martini. Ellenwood’s riff on the classic keeps the one-to-one ratio of gin to vermouth, but it achieves that balance with split measures of dry vermouth and blanc vermouth. The latter adds just a hint of floral sweetness to the drink. “I think using both can achieve a really lovely balance, something we are always looking for in our cocktails,” says Ellenwood. For the gin, she chose Amass , a dry gin based in California that features 29 botanicals. In addition to familiar examples like juniper, coriander and citrus peels, it also includes many unexpected picks like mushrooms, ashwagandha and locally grown bay leaf, which provide warm and earthy undertones. Any Martini featuring all spirits, including this one, should be stirred rather than shaken.

https://www.liquor.com/ferrari-shot-recipe-6823167,Ferrari,Audrey Morgan,"A shot of Fernet-Branca is the unofficial “bartender’s handshake,” a liquid greeting to a fellow industry worker. If you’ve mastered the handshake, try another embrace: the Ferrari, an equal-parts combination of Fernet-Branca and another beloved Italian amaro, Campari. An amaro is a bittersweet herbal liqueur made by infusing an alcoholic base (such as a grape brandy, neutral spirit, or wine) with ingredients such as herbs, roots, spices, and flowers, then sweetening the concoction. Amari (the plural of amaro) can be produced anywhere, but they’re a staple of the culture in Italy, where they’re often served as pre-meal aperitifs or after-dinner digestifs. Campari and Fernet-Branca are two amari with storied histories and devoted fans. Campari dates to 1860, when Gaspare Campari invented the liqueur outside of Milan. Like most amari, its recipe is a closely held secret, but many drinkers speculate its prominent bitter flavor comes from chinotto oranges. The amaro is the backbone of many popular cocktails, including the Negroni and the Americano , and has lent its bitter citrus notes and bright-red hue to countless modern classics over the years, such as the Tiki-inspired Jungle Bird . Fernet-Branca, meanwhile, is part of a larger category of fernet amari that are typically characterized by medicinal-tasting and herbaceous flavors. Known for its strong licorice and mint notes, Fernet-Branca was invented by Bernandino Branca in Milan in 1845; as with Campari, its recipe is a secret, but some of its known components include myrrh, saffron, chamomile, and gentian. The stateside Fernet obsession is thought to have started in San Francisco, where the amaro really caught on in the late 1990s and early 2000s . In addition to its status as the “bartender’s handshake,” Fernet-Branca has been immortalized in the form of many industry-worker tattoos. Because of its strong flavor, Fernet is often used more judiciously in cocktails than other amari; it’s included as a supporting ingredient in the Toronto and Hanky Panky . Fernet is also sipped on ice, sometimes with Coca-Cola. (It’s particularly popular in Argentina, where Fernet con Coca is the national cocktail). As its name implies, the Ferrari is typically consumed quickly, as a shot, but you can also turn it into a cocktail to appreciate the complexity of the two beloved amari. Just increase the amounts of Campari and Fernet-Branca to one and a half ounces each (or whatever quantity you prefer, keeping the 1:1 ratio); stir both with ice in a mixing glass and strain into a coupe glass. The resulting shot or cocktail will be relatively high-octane: Fernet-Branca has an ABV of 39%, nearly that of a typical spirit, while Campari has an ABV of 24%. Whichever way you drink it, you just might find a new favorite handshake.

It’s sweet, it’s simple, and it signals the start of a fun night. Plus, the layered combination of butterscotch schnapps and Irish cream liqueur doubles as an impressive party trick. Alongside other suggestively named drinks (hello, Sex on the Beach ), this shooter was popularized in the 1980s, but its appeal lives on today. It could be considered a relative of the similarly named Slippery Nipple , which consists of sambuca, grenadine, and Irish cream liqueur, but the two shooters share only one common ingredient: the Irish cream liqueur. The Buttery Nipple, as its name loosely implies, adds butterscotch schnapps, which are usually made by mixing brown sugar and butter with a base spirit; the most common brand on shelves is DeKuyper’s Buttershots. The combination of the schnapps and the Irish cream liqueur produces a sweet and rich shooter that many compare to creamy butterscotch candy. Of course, half the fun of this shooter is its striking layers. To create the two-tone effect, layer an Irish cream liqueur such as Baileys over the butterscotch schnapps by pouring it slowly and carefully over the back of a bar spoon (You’ll want to make sure your ingredients are chilled first, as you won’t be adding any ice). The layering trick is simple enough for anyone to try at home and adds visual flair, but you can also shake the ingredients with ice and strain into shot glasses if you prefer. Like many shooters, the Buttery Nipple is relatively moderate in alcohol content, with the schnapps at about 15% ABV and the Irish cream liqueur around 17%. Some recipes call for the addition of vodka to produce a boozier shot; if you reach for a spirit, just make sure to add it to the shot glass before floating the lighter Irish cream layer in order to ensure proper separation and retain the visual appeal. Give this drink a shot, then try a more advanced three-part layering technique with a round of B-52s , if you dare.

https://www.liquor.com/pina-verde-cocktail-recipe-5220883,Piña Verde,Audrey Morgan,"If you like Piña Coladas , you might just fall in love with this green-Chartreuse-fueled twist from bar pro Erick Castro. The story of the Piña Verde begins more than a decade ago: In the late aughts, Castro began floating the French liqueur green Chartreuse on top of Piña Coladas for an extra boozy element. In 2010, the then-ambassador for Beefeater tried swapping in gin for the usual rum. He ultimately scrapped the spirits altogether to spotlight the high-proof green Chartreuse, which lent the drink herbaceous notes that played well with the creamy coconut. Castro added his creation to the menu of his cocktail bar Polite Provisions in San Diego, California, where staff dubbed the drink the “Greenya Colada,” and it became bicoastal when he started serving it at New York City’s (now-shuttered) Boilermaker in 2014; by that bar’s second year, the Piña Verde was a top seller. The drink started appearing on cocktail menus around the country, and the rest is history. Of course, the Piña Verde owes its success, in part, to the simple deliciousness of its predecessor. Ramón “Monchito” Marrero most likely invented the original concoction of rum, coconut, and pineapple and lime juices in 1954 at the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico, although several other spots in the city lay claim to the drink. Thanks to the cocktail’s tropical nature, it's still often confused with Tiki drinks , and it doesn’t help that by the 1970s it had fallen victim to the disco era, often ending up in extra-large glasses that held overly sweet, premixed slushies. Today, craft bartenders are returning the drink to its roots with properly balanced ingredients, and some are opting to swap the traditional blender for shaker tins, including Castro. His rendition takes its cues from the classic while also adding modern twists: The star, of course, is its namesake green Chartreuse. As with the original, pineapple and lime juices add fruity brightness to the mix. Castro’s version slightly dials down the cream of coconut, the secret to a colada’s rich, creamy sweetness, as the Chartreuse lends sweet notes of its own. And in lieu of a pineapple-and-cherry garnish or a tiny umbrella, it gets topped with a fresh mint sprig—all the better to highlight the drink’s herbaceous nature and colorful name. 8 Cocktails for Chartreuse-Lovers RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'green Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cream of coconut'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over pebble ice.', 'Add more pebble ice, if needed, to create a slight mound.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",20,

But it also offers layers of aromatic complexity thanks to the herbal liqueur kümmel and a rich cinnamon syrup. This recipe comes from Colin Bugbee, the head bartender at Cure in New Orleans, which kicked off the Crescent City’s craft-cocktail revival. The drink gets its namesake fire from a blend of vodka and chile de árbol peppers, which pack a neutral, burning heat. These tiny-but-mighty Mexican chile peppers, also called bird’s beak chiles, rate between 15,000 to 30,000 Scoville units on the heat index (jalapeños rate 2,500 to 8,000, by comparison). You’ll want to procure dried ones, or dry your own. “I like to use dried peppers because they’re more easily controlled and more consistent,” says Bugbee. They’re also more neutral in flavor than fresh chiles, allowing the kümmel’s spices, namely caraway and cumin, to take a starring role alongside tequila’s vegetal notes. Bugbee balances out the fire of the chiles with fluffy, soothing egg whites, lemon and grapefruit juices, and rich cinnamon syrup, which sweetens the drink while also lending additional layers of spice. Lastly, a splash of refreshing club soda in the shaker helps to keep the heat in, well, check.

As with many classic cocktails, you’ll find different variations of the recipe; this cocktail seems to vary more than most.

https://www.liquor.com/love-and-murder-cocktail-recipe-5211432,Love & Murder,Kathryn Maier,"Campari and green Chartreuse are two of the most polarizing liqueurs in the cocktail world. Most people love them, but many don’t. The former’s bitterness and the latter’s biting, boozy herbaceousness can overwhelm sensitive palates; both, if used injudiciously, can render a cocktail spiky and unbalanced. The two aren’t often found together in the same glass. Especially not as the leading players; their strong flavors mean both are usually relegated to supporting-actor status. So this cocktail, served at Porchlight in New York City and created by bar director Nick Bennett, proves surprising on multiple fronts. Green Chartreuse and Campari come together as the backbone of a shockingly balanced and delicious cocktail that, once you look past the surprise of the two together in the same shaker, is basically not much more than a typical sour-format cocktail, one of the most common formulations in the drinks world; it's just that no one had previously thought to employ these two liqueurs. And with green Chartreuse’s high 55% ABV compensating for Campari’s lower 24%, the resulting cocktail is about the same proof as, say, a Daiquiri or a Whiskey Sour, or any other sour made with a standard-strength spirit. “What I wanted was a cocktail that felt classic,” says Bennett. “The combination of Campari and green Chartreuse was something that I hadn’t come across enough and (surprisingly) never as the main ingredients.” It does indeed seem to have the makings of a modern classic, despite its unconventional ingredients. “I was overjoyed that it turned out as good as it did, because on paper it doesn’t seem like it should work,” he says. The recipe seems as simple as it comes, once you get past the unconventional combination of flavors. But there’s a final secret: the addition of saline solution. Adding a touch of salt to cocktails can enhance sweetness and balance bitterness; with just a few drops, the salinity doesn’t reach perceptible levels, but it draws out the other flavors in the drink. And the drink’s name? One might surmise it arose from the combination of opposites: a red liqueur and a green one, a Christmassy pair sitting across from each other on the color wheel. Or perhaps that people often love one of the liqueurs involved but hate the other. That would be reading too much into it, however. “The name comes from a great Broadway play that I had seen a few years earlier called The Gentleman’s Guide to Love and Murder ,” says Bennett. “I really enjoyed that title and thought the Broadway actors that frequent Porchlight would get a kick out of it.”","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'green Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'saline solution (5:1 water to kosher salt)'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.']",73,

https://www.liquor.com/hugo-spritz-cocktail-recipe-5194222,Hugo Spritz,Kara Newman,"In their book Spritz: Italy’s Most Iconic Aperitivo Cocktail , Talia Baiocchi and Leslie Pariseau draw inspiration from the lighter side of the cocktail spectrum. To deepen their understanding of the Spritz, the authors embarked on a 10-day road trip in a tiny Fiat 500 coupe across northern Italy, from Venice to Milan to Turin. Traveling along the unofficial “Spritz Trail” of Italy, the authors describe how the Spritz —basically a combination of three parts prosecco, two parts bitter liqueur, such as Aperol or Campari , and one part soda—changes from city to city. “We discovered that the Spritz’s biggest secret is that it really is much more than a recipe or a category of drinks,” they say. “The Spritz is a regional perspective on the aperitif,” signifying a cultural way that certain regions in the north think about aperitifs. 12 Spritz Recipes to Make All Year FEATURED IN The Hugo Spritz is one such regional signature. In the South Tyrol province of Northern Italy amid the Dolomite mountain range where the cocktail originates, the Hugo Spritz isn’t made with a bitter aperitif but an elderflower cordial often made locally by allowing the flowers and sugar to ferment in the sun instead. Readily available St-Germain elderflower liqueur is used instead in this recipe. The combination works by presenting an alternative to more popularly known Italian spritzes, like the Aperol Spritz or Campari Spritz , which use bitter red liqueur as their base. By forgoing the bitter element and instead opting for a floral base of elderflower, it allows the natural lemon and citrus notes found typically in prosecco to display more prominently. The mint then takes the task of providing the nose and finish on the drink, which skews cooler and creates the effect of a cleaner tasting spritz than its bitter-based counterparts, with flavors that don't overstay their welcome.

https://www.liquor.com/grasshopper-two-cocktail-recipe-5190061,Grasshopper 2.0,Kelly Magyarics,"“Creme de menthe is very versatile, but it needs a steady hand and a good-quality brand to use it successfully and not overpower the drink,” says Naren Young, the creative director at Sweet Liberty in Miami. It’s an ingredient that’s seen most commonly in the classic Grasshopper , a drink that dates back to the early 1900s but these days is most often associated with the 1970s disco era . The sweet mix of creme de menthe, creme de cacao and heavy cream is a retro dessert drink that, while not bad, could use some modernizing and livening up. That’s exactly what Young has done in his update to the classic. He has added mezcal, the minty Italian amaro Branca Menta and a touch of absinthe to the mix, heightening both the mintiness and boozy factor and deepening the drink’s flavor. If you’re using high-quality brands, the white and green versions of the liqueur should taste nearly identical within the same brand; the difference between the two is merely a matter of aesthetics. Young likes the flavor of Tempus Fugit, which is available only in a white version, so he adds a bit of food coloring to make his Grasshopper variant look like the original green iteration of the classic cocktail. You can do the same if you like, but even if you don’t have any food coloring on hand, the drink will still taste just as good. What the #$@! Do I Do with This?

https://www.liquor.com/portobello-rum-punch-cocktail-recipe-6499925,Portobello Rum Punch,Tyler Zielinski,"A rum punch is a drink that needs to follow few rules. As long as the mixture contains citrus and/or other fruit juices, a sweetener, a spice element, and, most crucially, rum, the rest of the ingredients and the technique used to make it are up for interpretation and often vary regionally. Today, modern Jamaican rum punches pull some inspiration from the classic Planter’s Punch , but the recipe has evolved over time into something that is often tailored to taste. “The modern Jamaican rum punch is characterized by its use of multiple fruit juices, including pineapple, orange, and lime, and of course nutmeg as the spice component to garnish,” Sly Augustin, the owner of Trailer Happiness in London, says. Augustin has his own requirements for the drink. “For me, the most important part of a Jamaican rum punch is the addition of overproof Jamaican rum,” he says. But that’s not all. “Regardless of the ingredients used and what inspired the recipe, a rum punch should almost taste like something made in a home rather than a bar,” he continues. “It’s not perfectly balanced; it’s often a little boozy, and it’s always a lot of fun to drink.” The tropical-fruity Jamaican-style rum punch Augustin serves at his bar is certainly boozy, and does indeed call for overproof rum. He takes the additional step of adding some blue food coloring to it, producing a whimsically turquoise-hued drink, but you can leave the coloring out if you prefer. Angostura bitters replace the traditional nutmeg as the drink’s spice element, with their aromatic baking-spice notes. You can also feel free to experiment with the drink’s juices, if you like. This recipe calls for guava and lime, but you might try pineapple, mango, passion fruit, orange, or any combination of those or others, if you’re so inclined. Just don’t forget the one non-negotiable: Jamaican rum.

https://www.liquor.com/haitian-divorce-cocktail-recipe-6499854,Haitian Divorce,Kathryn Maier,"Drinks pro Tom Richter, the creator and owner of Tomr’s Tonic and the luxury spirits portfolio consultant at Spirit of Gallo , created the Haitian Divorce in 2012 while he was the head bartender at the now-shuttered sherry-centric bar The Beagle in New York City. It’s essentially an Old Fashioned riff and is perhaps the best-known member of a series of matrimonially themed drinks that came out of the bar (including the Shotgun Wedding and Remember the Alimony) . Beagle co-owner and beverage director Dan Greenbaum created a drink with a split base of bourbon and calvados that employed pedro ximenez sherry as a sweetener, which he dubbed the Second Marriage. (“The first marriage, in brown liquors, is rye and cognac in a Sazerac ,” explains Richter.) Richter took Greenbaum’s drink and tweaked it, experimenting with different bases until he came up with a combination of rum and mezcal, which together evoke the flavor of Scotch whisky. “The mezcal made it smoky, and the aged Haitian rum was hard to distinguish,” he says. “If people don’t know what’s in it, they think it’s a smoky whisky, but it’s a little more complex than that.” Haitian r(h)ums, he explains, are agricoles that are aged. “It has a lot of earthiness, and then the age softens that out,” says Richter. “So it doesn’t taste like just any rum that’s out there.” The mezcal adds the smoky note. At a number of bars that serve the drink regularly, including Dear Irving (where Richter was the head bartender during the bar’s first three years) or Attaboy (where he has also worked), “When people want a scotch Old Fashioned, they’ll give them this,” he says. “When they want a rum Old Fashioned , they’ll also give them this.” If you spot a Sasha Petraske influence in this cocktail, you’re not wrong. In addition to working at both Attaboy and the seminal cocktail bar Milk & Honey, Richter also worked alongside Petraske to open the (now-shuttered) John Dory Oyster Bar and cites him as a significant influence. “He was the godfather of all of what we’re doing,” he says. The cocktail calls for both an orange twist and a lime twist. The choice is not merely for visual flair; it was the result of extensive experimentation. When Richter was creating the drink, he reports, he couldn’t figure out what type of twist to use. “Orange killed the mezcal flavor,” he says. “Lemon killed the rum flavor. Lime kind of bumped up the mezcal just enough.” And thus, the winning combination was born. As for the drink’s name? Richter was a fan of the band Steely Dan, which has a song called the Haitian Divorce; between the collection of matrimonial-themed drinks, the Haitian rum employed in the drink, and the song title, it all came together.

He cites ube halaya, a jam of sorts made with ube, or purple yam, as his favorite dessert for “as long as I can remember.” In tribute to that treat, he created a frothy purple Colada rendition employing both ube halaya and Don Papa rum (also Filipino in origin), blended together with pineapple juice and both coconut water and coconut milk. Once the mix is spun with ice until smooth, it all gets topped with whipped coconut cream and a shower of dehydrated and crumbled blueberries. The resulting drink, says Rojo, has been his favorite he’s run the past several summers. “There’s nothing I’d rather drink while the sun’s up,” he says. Rojo recommends serving the drink ice-cold. “It’s the ultimate summer sipper,” he says.

Mango is among those ingredients, particularly as Filipino mango offers its own distinct flavor profile. “Philippine mangoes are sweeter than Mexican mangoes, which you typically see in the US,” says Watson. “It’s closer in flavor to a peach.” To round out this mango-fueled Daiquiri riff, Watson adds a spoonful of yuzu kosho, a Japanese chile sauce fermented with yuzu. “I like playing with less obvious and contrasting flavor pairings,” he says. It adds a little heat to the typical Daiquiri format, as does a rim of calamansi honey (calamansi, a flavor-packed citrus, being another common Filipino ingredient) and shichimi togarashi, a Japanese spice blend.

https://www.liquor.com/angostura-colada-cocktail-recipe-6361371,Angostura Colada,Audrey Morgan,"Bitters are often used in cocktail-making like salt and pepper in cooking: If you’ve ever mixed up a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned, you’re almost certainly familiar with the flavor-bolstering properties even a few drops can provide. But at Brooklyn’s Fort Defiance , head bartender Zac Overman, now the owner of Seattle’s L’Oursin , put them front and center in his Piña Colada riff. In 2014, Overman started hosting a weekly Tiki night at Fort Defiance called the Sunken Harbor Club, which has since morphed into a tropical bar of the same name above Downtown Brooklyn’s Gage & Tollner restaurant. In creating this drink for that series of events, he found inspiration in Giuseppe González’s Trinidad Sour , which calls for a previously inconceivable ounce and a half of Angostura bitters. He employs an equally huge quantity of the ingredient more typically measured in dashes in his Colada twist. “The Trinidad Sour is 100% the reason this drink exists,” says Overman. “Nobody thought to use bitters as a base spirit before.” The Piña Colada might not be a true Tiki cocktail, but its tropical nature made Overman’s drink right at home alongside his takes on Tiki classics like the White Zombie at his Sunken Harbor Club pop-up. “Ango has all of the warm baking-spice notes that so many Tiki drinks evoke, taken to the nth degree,” he says. “I think of it as a supercharged over-spiced rum in this cocktail.” The bitters that form this drink’s base have an alcohol content similar to that of most spirits, about 45% ABV, and Overman adds a half-ounce of Smith & Cross rum for additional aromatics. If you don’t have that specific brand on hand, opt for a strong and funky pot-still rum that can stand up to the Angostura’s intensity; he also recommends the Younger bottling from Hampden Estate, another Jamaican producer. “As long as the bottle you choose makes you pull the gas face, it will work,” he quips. The one non-negotiable, according to Overman: the drink’s namesake bitters. “I tried this with Peychaud’s at some point, but it was gross,” he says. “No offense to Peychaud’s! It just didn't work.” Just as the Sunken Harbor Club has evolved beyond a weekly pop-up into a brick-and-mortar bar, the Angostura Colada has cemented its status as a modern classic. A version has landed on the menu of the Brooklyn hotspot, where it has been upgraded with a housemade coconut cream, an acid-adjusted pineapple juice, and a flash blend, but the recipe below hews closely to the original.

https://www.liquor.com/test-pilot-cocktail-recipe-6361211,Test Pilot,Liquor.com,"Cocktail riffs often overshadow their precursors: After all, you’re likely more familiar with the Martini than the Martinez , or the Margarita than the Tequila Daisy . Such is the case with the absinthe-spiked Tiki cocktail the Test Pilot, which served as a test run for the more popular Jet Pilot . The latter seems to get all the spotlight these days: The cinnamon-syrup-spiced twist is on the menus of famed Tiki bars such as Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, Hale Pele in Portland, False Idol in San Diego, and Smuggler’s Cove in San Francisco, which cheekily lists “nerves of steel” as an ingredient. The Jet Pilot’s predecessor was invented by Tiki legend Donn Beach , who was inspired by his travels in the South Pacific to open his namesake bar Don the Beachcomber in 1930s Hollywood. The end of Prohibition and the reality of the Great Depression meant people were looking for an escape, which they found in Beach’s thatch-roofed bar and blended-rum cocktails. Well-known for liquid legacies including the Zombie and the Navy Grog , Beach created the Test Pilot around 1941. He blended two rums, Cointreau, falernum, lime juice, Angostura bitters, and six drops of Pernod with crushed ice, producing a refreshing and complex drink with citrus, spice, and anise notes. The Test Pilot’s name owes to its era: Beach was an Air Force veteran, and the Jet Age was dawning in the United States with the invention of the jet engine. But the drink indeed served as a test pilot for variations like the Astronaut, the Space Pilot, and, of course, the Jet Pilot. The Test Pilot shares some similarities with its successor: Blending rums lends complexity, falernum adds richness and depth, and lime juice brightens the mix. The Jet Pilot, however, adds grapefruit juice to the lime component and omits the Cointreau. Both cocktails call for a short spin in the blender, rendering a crushed-ice texture. One sip of the Test Pilot and you might be surprised this Jet Age classic didn’t take off more.

https://www.liquor.com/jet-pilot-cocktail-recipe-5705288,Jet Pilot,Liquor.com,"Cocktails are often evocative of their eras, and this spiced riff on the Tiki favorite Test Pilot indeed took flight during the Jet Age. Jet engines were invented by the military in the 1930s and ’40s, and by the 1950s, civilians were flying in style on turbo-powered commercial airplanes. This exciting time in U.S. aviation history coincided with the Tiki craze in the United States. The Test Pilot was the creation of Donn Beach , the godfather of Tiki himself. Inspired by his travels in the South Pacific, Beach opened his bar Don the Beachcomber in Los Angeles as Prohibition was winding down in 1934, ushering in a new rum-soaked era of cocktail history best encapsulated by his motto: “If you can’t get to paradise, I’ll bring it to you.” He invented the Test Pilot around 1941, combining a blend of rums, Cointreau, falernum, lime juice, Angostura bitters, and Pernod with crushed ice in a blender. Many quirky Jet Age variations took off, including the Astronaut and the Space Pilot, but perhaps the most well-known is the Jet Pilot, which was invented in 1958 at the now-shuttered Beverly Hills hotspot Luau, a Tiki bar owned by actor Steve Crane. This Tiki cocktail hews fairly closely to its predecessor, but calls for the addition of a cinnamon syrup, which lends spice notes to the classic. It omits the Cointreau entirely, as the cinnamon syrup helps to sweeten the drink, and it also adds grapefruit juice to the lime. As is the case with the Test Pilot, it continues the Tiki tradition of blending rums , another legacy of Donn Beach, combining two overproof rums and a milder gold rum. Lime and grapefruit juices brighten the mix, and falernum, a spiced almond syrup that adds richness to many Tiki drinks, also goes into the blender. Dashes of absinthe and Angostura bitters, meanwhile, lend complexity and round out the drink’s flavors without overpowering them. The Jet Pilot might technically be a frozen drink , but you should still keep an eye on the blender: You’ll want to blend your ingredients until they’re combined but not completely smooth, so the drink has a pleasing crushed-ice texture. One sip will transport you to the tropics, no flight required.

https://www.liquor.com/queens-park-swizzle-cocktail-recipe-5649402,Queens Park Swizzle,Liquor.com,"Trinidad’s Queens Park Hotel may have closed in 1996, but its eponymous drink has endured well into the 21st century. It’s not hard to see why: The icy mix of demerara rum, mint, sugar, lime juice, and Angostura bitters has served as a delicious and eye-catching way to cool off since it debuted at the Port of Spain hotel in the early 20th century. Today, the drink is enjoyed on the island and beyond; the Trinidad-based House of Angostura has even angled to make it Trinidad and Tobago’s national drink . A refreshing interplay of rum, lime juice, sugar, and mint make the Queens Park Swizzle similar to the Mojito . In addition to those ingredients, however, it also calls for one of Trinidad’s most famous exports, Angostura bitters, yielding a more aromatic and flavorful drink. It also employs demerara rum rather than the light rum called for in a Mojito. The former is distilled a boat ride away from Trinidad in the country of Guyana, using sugarcane grown on the banks of the Demerara River. (Guyana had a more established rum industry at the time of the drink’s invention.) Known for its rich, earthy, caramelly, and slightly smoky flavors, demerara rum is perhaps most comparable to Jamaican rum; reach for a high-quality bottle such as El Dorado. The Queens Park Swizzle is one of the most well-known members of the swizzle cocktail family , drinks named for the tool used in their preparation. The original swizzle stick was made with twigs from forked branches of a South Caribbean evergreen tree; today you’ll still find wooden ones, although likely not made from the original type of tree, as well as metal and plastic versions. To swizzle properly, you’ll need to use crushed ice. After you’ve added your ingredients, fill your glass halfway with the ice and place your palms on either side of the stick’s shaft; slide your hands back and forth to agitate the ingredients until frost forms on the outside of the glass. If you don’t have a swizzle stick on hand, you can also use a bar spoon for this step. Of course, half the fun of the Queens Park Swizzle is its dramatic green, gold, and red layers. The swizzle method will ensure the muddled mint stays packed at the bottom, and adding the last two dashes of bitters after mounding the drink with ice produces the top red layer. The resulting cocktail is both aromatic and refreshing. Give it a twirl and you’ll understand why Tiki legend Trader Vic declared it “the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today” in 1946.

If you’re a banana lover, this combination of aged rum, banana, coffee liqueur, and half-and-half might just become your new favorite frozen drink . It’s unclear where and when the Dirty Banana first originated, but today the tropical-leaning drink is popular at many Caribbean resorts. Lacking vacation days? It’s equally delicious served from your blender as it is at a swim-up pool bar. For the backbone of the drink, you’ll want to opt for an aged rum: It adds caramelly depth to the mix and plays off the fruitiness of the banana. You might also try a spiced rum to add some complexity to the creamy sweetness. While you can swap in a light rum in a pinch, it’s best saved for your Daiquiris and Mojitos , as it will produce a crisper, less rich drink. The cocktail’s fruity flavor comes from both real banana and banana liqueur. Don’t toss the browning bananas on your countertop: Their concentrated sweetness is ideal for the recipe below. As for the liqueur, Giffard Banane du Brésil or Tempus Fugit Crème de Banane are industry favorites for their authentic banana flavor. This drink only calls for one ounce, however, so feel free to reach for a cheaper or more widely available option, such as Bols or even 99 Bananas , if you dare. A coffee liqueur such as Kahlúa lends its rich flavor and an additional boozy kick to the Dirty Banana; it also helps differentiate the drink from a frozen Banana Daiquiri . Adding half-and-half and ice to the blender essentially renders this drink a boozy milkshake. Some recipes even add chocolate syrup to the mix, emphasizing the “drinkable dessert” concept.

One twist that takes the cocktail to an entirely different plane is swapping out the usual lean and botanical gin in favor of a notoriously flavorful and funky overproof Jamaican rum, which is what Joaquín Simó, bartender and partner in New York City bar Pouring Ribbons, did when he first made the drink in 2010. “I can’t explain what possessed me, but within five minutes of importer Eric Seed handing me a bottle of Smith & Cross for the very first time, I had created this drink,” says Simó. “It's certainly not the most imaginative thing I've ever done—I simply ‘Mr. Potato Headed’ rum for gin in a classic Negroni spec—but it still strikes me as strange that the first thought I had when smelling and tasting a huge, funky, estery, hogo-reeking, grilled banana bread, smoking allspice-branches-laden brute of an overproof Jamaican rum was wondering how it would work in a stirred aperitivo.” Most Negronis and their variations allow for personal preference when it comes to choosing a sweet vermouth , the flavors of which can vary widely, but there’s a clear best option for this drink: Carpano Antica. “I usually steer clear of Antica in Negronis, as it tends to be a bit of a bully, especially in equal proportions,” says Simó. “But Smith & Cross is no shrinking violet, so it stands up to the bombastic chocolate and bitter orange notes in the vermouth while drying out the Campari's richness and tempering its bitterness.” The resulting drink features enormously powerful flavors that all work in harmony to temper and complement each other. Not bad for a simple three-ingredient cocktail. “Further evidence that less can sometimes be quite a bit more,"" says Simó.

https://www.liquor.com/missionarys-downfall-cocktail-recipe-5220747,Missionary’s Downfall,Liquor.com,"The irresistible nature of the Missionary’s Downfall is right in its name. And who could turn down this frozen, fruity concoction of mint, white rum, peach liqueur, lime juice, and pineapple? While it’s often overshadowed by more ubiquitous Tiki drinks like the Mai Tai and the Navy Grog , the Missionary’s Downfall is the invention of Donn Beach , founder of the Don the Beachcomber bars and the godfather of Tiki himself. Born in New Orleans as Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, the man who renamed himself Donn Beach was a restless world traveler who ended up in Los Angeles as Prohibition was winding down. Inspired by his beach escapades, Beach rented a 25-seat Hollywood bar in 1934, decorating the space with souvenirs from his South Pacific travels and slinging blends of fruit juice, unheard-of liqueurs, and multiple rums that he called Rhum Rhapsodies. He also coined a philosophy which inspired countless thatch-roofed copycats across the country, most notably Trader Vic’s in Oakland, California: “If you can’t get to paradise, I’ll bring it to you.” Donn’s most famous liquid legacy might just be the Zombie , a powerful blend of three rums, anise-flavored liqueur , falernum, grenadine, lime juice, and a cinnamon-grapefruit mix bearing his name. But he also invented the less lethal, if equally delicious, Missionary’s Downfall in the 1930s or ‘40s. Today, you’ll find plenty of variations on the classic: Don’s Mai Tai Bar at Hawaii’s Royal Kona Resort (connected to Beach himself) adds ginger liqueur. At Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, the drink has been served with nitro-muddled mint and also alongside an optional green Chartreuse float. And at Beachbum Berry’s Latitude 29 in New Orleans, there’s an option to swap the light rum for vodka. But the recipe below hews closely to the original. A white rum and up to a dozen mint leaves produce a crisp, refreshing cocktail, while creme de peche and honey syrup sweeten the mix. (Avoid using peach schnapps, which will yield a sweeter beverage.) Pineapple chunks and freshly squeezed lime juice, meanwhile, lend their fruity brightness. Compared to other Tiki cocktails, which are often notoriously strong, the Missionary’s Downfall is relatively moderate in alcohol. But as its name implies, you might not be able to limit yourself to just one. 11 Frozen Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de peche'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'pineapple chunk'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '8-12', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'large mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a blender with 3/4 cup of ice and blend for about 20 seconds.', 'Pour into a Collins glass.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig and a pineapple wedge.', 'Serve with a straw.']",20,rum
https://www.liquor.com/rum-flip-cocktail-recipe-5213043,Rum Flip,Liquor.com,"This cocktail recipe comes courtesy of distiller and bar pro Allen Katz. It’s a classic flip, a style of cocktail notable for the inclusion of a whole egg, and often also heavy cream in order to make the drink even richer and creamier. Cocktails that call for egg whites are common; it’s a way of adding texture and body to a drink. It’s less common to use the yolks as well, however, which is why those drinks get their own category. Flips tend to be rich and frothy cold-weather drinks, and this cocktail is a perfect example. Flips also make ideal nightcaps, the final drink of the evening meant to usher the drinker to a good sleep. “An urbane and debonair means to capping the evening,” says Katz of the nightcap. “The practice of drinking a cocktail before bed likely started in the 18th century as a useful (and pleasant) means to warm the body and soul before turning in on a chilly night. It was surely predated by the equally practical and stylish sleeping attire of the same name,” he says. As Katz notes, Charles H. Baker’s The Gentleman’s Companion is an excellent reference in which to find historic nightcap recipes. “An American culinary and cocktail writer, Baker’s quixotic adventures would often end appropriately with a “capper” like the Porto Flip or a Rum Flip, opulent drinks of layered flavors and aromas meant to impress as well as to soothe,” says Katz. This simple recipe will produce a richly flavored (and textured) drink exactly like Katz describes. Go ahead and end your night with this cocktail. It’s certain to ensure sweet dreams.

The result is a rich, boozy, but bright drink with a low-waste lean. “My favorite ingredient right now is anything up-cycled or recycled, anything that reduces waste and our impact on the environment,” says Kuehner. “So we use the avocado seeds that would normally be discarded from our kitchen to make an avocado-pit orgeat. We also use the spent lime rind or husk from juicing as part of the garnish to house a float of rum."" Two different Jamaican rums go into the drink, plus a third for the flaming garnish. They’re joined by a pour of tawny port, adding its rich, nutty notes, which are accented by the aforementioned orgeat made from the most unusual of sources. A dash of absinthe (plus five of Angostura) adds another unusual element before the drink veers solidly back into the tropical realm with lime and pineapple juices. A flaming garnish of overproof rum and a maraschino cherry in a spent lime husk adds a final flourish.

Of course, if we’re talking tennis, the phrase has a different connotation; it refers to the four most important tennis events of the year. In either case, a Grand Slam is a big deal, a raging success, which is what you have with this cocktail that originally appeared in David Embury’s The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks and has been updated by bar pro Allen Katz, the cofounder of New York Distilling Company .

The specific rum it calls for, a 15-year-old reserve rum, is perhaps an upgrade to what you usually might throw into your standard rum-ginger-lime drink, but any aged rum will play nicely in this cocktail. This cocktail replaces the ginger beer used in its better-known relative with a mixture of stout-style beer and a spicy ginger-habanero syrup. The pepper adds an extra level of spice to the drink, and the tartness of the deeply malty stout matches perfectly with the lime, ginger, and rum. Making the syrup certainly adds an extra step to the process, but we think you’ll agree it’s worth it to produce this richly flavorful cocktail. It’s more earthy and complex than the popular summer sipper it emulates, meaning it’s fantastic well into the colder months and, really, all year ‘round.

https://www.liquor.com/rum-coke-cocktail-recipe-5199586,Rum & Coke,Liquor.com,"It’s the simplest of two-ingredient cocktails : The recipe is right there in the drink’s name. But there’s more to it than meets the eye. A favorite of many bar pros as well as casual drinkers, this simple drink can be customized to your individual taste in a number of ways. Proportions matter, as does the type of rum used. There’s really no wrong type of rum to use in a Rum & Coke. White or light rum, dark rum, and even spiced rum all work equally well; it’s up to your personal preferences which style you should go with. You might even try a combination of different types of rum: Using half light and half dark rum will produce a light, bright drink with vanilla and caramel notes on the finish. The cola you choose matters significantly, since it will make up by far the largest portion of the drink. The classic Coca-Cola is a great choice, since its relatively high acidity renders it a good match with rum. Alternatively, go with Mexican Coke if you want something slightly less sweet (it’s made with cane sugar instead of corn syrup), or try a cola that’s made especially for use in cocktails, such as Fever-Tree’s Distillers Cola. Adding a half-ounce or so of freshly squeezed lime juice never hurts; it works amazingly well to brighten the drink. Although, technically, that minor addition—or even a mere lime-wedge garnish—turns it into a different cocktail entirely, the Cuba Libre , the drink from which the Rum & Coke evolved. A couple dashes of Angostura bitters is another optional but worthwhile addition, serving to amp up the cola’s flavors and adding baking-spice notes to the finish. As for proportions, again, that’s up to you, but keep in mind that a 2-to-1 or 3-to-1 mix of cola to rum generally leads to the most balanced drink. If you prefer yours sweeter or more spirit-forward, though, we won’t judge: As with all cocktails, the only rule is to make your drink however you like to drink it.

Like its boozy siblings, it was invented at a Caribbean resort. Its creation is credited to bartender Angie Conigliaro at the Ship’s Store & Sapphire Pub on the island of St. Thomas in the USVI in 1975. It’s said to have been named for a patron’s dog. Shortly after, the owner of the Sandshaker Bar in Pensacola, Florida, visited the St. Thomas resort bar, where she fell in love with the Bushwacker and brought it back to her own bar, where it grew in fame. A version is now mass-produced in a bottled format by Bushwacker Spirits , and an annual festival celebrating the drink is held in Pensacola. The original recipe is said to have included rum, Baileys Irish cream, creme de cacao and coconut cream. In the years since its creation, the formula has undergone many variations, some seriously booze-heavy, some barely containing any alcohol at all. You’ll find any combination of rum, coffee and amaretto liqueurs, Baileys, triple sec and creme de cacao. Flavored rums sometimes make an appearance. Some recipes double up on the cream of coconut and omit the milk or even swap in ice cream. Some double-down on the chocolate flavor with a drizzle of syrup over the glass. Our formulation leans more boozy and less saccharine-sweet than most. But there’s really no wrong way to make one.

https://www.liquor.com/rum-runner-cocktail-recipe-5196356,Rum Runner,Dylan Garret,"Like many classic cocktails before it, the Rum Runner is said to have been invented by a bartender simply looking to use up extra ingredients. It’s been claimed to have originated in the early 1970s at the Holiday Isle Tiki Bar (now the Tiki Bar at Postcard Inn ), located on Islamorada in the Florida Keys. Bar manager John Elber was allegedly clearing out dead stock to make room for fresh inventory when he improvised the drink by throwing the contents of old liquor bottles into a blender. Elber named the result—a combination of rum, banana liqueur, blackberry liqueur, grenadine, and tropical fruit juices—the Rum Runner, as a nod to the Florida Keys place in history as an important location in the illegal Prohibition-era alcohol-smuggling trade. Of course, as with most cocktail history, whether or not this story is true is up for debate. In fact, long before Elber’s time at Holiday Isle, the Rum Runner had already been listed as a named cocktail the 1937 cocktail book Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ‘Em by Stanley Arthur. However, Arthur’s earlier iteration vastly differs from the modern variation, and is essentially a Daiquiri that includes pineapple juice and Peychaud’s Bitters. The takeaway? When it comes to classic cocktails, nothing is new but few things stay the same. Why Does the Rum Runner Still Work? Even if we look only at the more popular Holiday Isle Tiki Bar iteration, it’s easy to find countless differing Rum Runner recipes. This is because the drink suffers the same fate of other historic tropical cocktails. As decades wear on, and variations are adlibbed and passed between bartenders like a game of Recipe Telephone, many tropical drinks slowly devolve into a generic rum punch. Consider it the cocktail version of the second law of thermodynamics—tropical drink entropy only increases over time. Bahama Mama 64 ratings However, certain tropical cocktails have key identifiers that remain no matter how they’re tweaked, like the Bahama Mama’s combination of coffee and pineapple, or the Piña Colada’s coconut, pineapple, and lime. In the Rum Runner, this thumbprint is its use of a trinity of sweet elements—banana liqueur, blackberry liqueur, and grenadine. What you get is a burst of tropical fruit flavor from a smaller volume of ingredients than if you were to simply make a punch out of similar juices. Lime is used to partially balance the sugar of the liqueurs, while pineapple juice brings in the rest of the citric acid needed to even out the drink’s sweetness. When mixed properly, the Rum Runner is a drink that maintains a good sugar-to-sour ratio, but isn’t overloaded with so much fruit juice that it washes out the cocktail’s rum base.

Distiller and drinks pro Simon Ford, the founder of Fords Gin, adapted this recipe from “ Modern American Drinks ” by George J. Kappeler published in 1895. Kappeler’s entire recipe read concisely as follows: “Take a long thin Collins-glass, put into it one lump of ice, one pony St. Croix rum, fill up with a cold bottle imported ginger ale. Serve.” Hewing closely to the spirit of Kappeler’s original cocktail, Ford calls for Cruzan rum, which is distilled on the island of St. Croix, in his version of the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/frozen-daiquiri-cocktail-recipe-5077630,Frozen Daiquiri,Dylan Garret,"We chill drinks by shaking them with ice and serving them on the rocks, but for some reason, blended drinks are often still divisive. There may be no better example of this than the Frozen Daiquiri, a drink based off one of the most beloved classic rum cocktails ever created, which still seems to get a bad rap when served blended with ice. This Cuban cocktail dates to the late 1800s and was popularized by its association with Ernest Hemingway (though whether he regularly drank them is still a matter of debate). The classic Daiquiri is traditionally served up or on the rocks, rather than frozen. But structurally speaking, when made right, there’s little to separate the blended Frozen Daiquiri from its traditional formulation, other than the manner in which ice and dilution are added. The result is still a tart, subtly sweet take on the classic rum sour template. Daiquiri 422 ratings Unfortunately, some of the stigma around the Frozen Daiquiri is well deserved, after a run of popularity in the 1980s and ’90s saw the drink adulterated with sticky-sweet commercially made sour mixes and artificially flavored daiquiri mixes that took less effort for bars and restaurants to use in bulk with frozen drink machines. But when mixed using the original combination of rum, freshly squeezed lime juice, sugar and ice, the drink remains as balanced and iconic as any other classic in the sour category, from the Sidecar to the Whiskey Sour or Margarita . Does a Frozen Daiquiri Need to Be Sweet? While the perception of Daiquiris is often of a sweet drink, this is more a reflection of popular tastes over the years rather than it’s intended profile. As a molasses or sugar cane-based liquor, rum tends to create a sweeter seeming spirit than some of its counterparts, which may explain why the Daiquiri is often believed to have more sugar than it actually does. However, when formulated the way it was meant to be, this drink should create more of a tart, and lightly sour profile than something that tastes like blended fruit juice. In the end, how you serve your Daiquiri—frozen, on the rocks, or up—is solely a matter of personal preference. On a warm day, or when drinking outside, the Frozen Daiquiri will provide the same profile and often stay cold longer, especially when compared to an up variation served in a coupe, which can turn tepid quickly. How Much Ice Should I Use in a Frozen Daiquiri? When making frozen drinks in a traditional blender, a good rule of thumb is a 3/4 cup of ice for every standard 4 ounces of other liquid ingredients, when creating a drink in the classic 2-1-1 golden ratio sour template (meaning 2 ounces of spirit to 1 ounce of lemon/lime juice and 1 ounce of simple syrup, for a single serving). This can be scaled up to create larger batches, but works well for a tasty, balanced Frozen Daiquiri. Other frozen drinks with different types of ingredients or amounts may need to be tailored based on taste, and desired slushiness. The recipe below serves two Frozen Daiquiris, as the drink tends to be best consumed with friends (or just to have a ready-made backup when sipping solo).

It varies in style and flavor, with notes that range from dry and grassy to fruity and funky with mild sweetness. Most people know cachaça because of the Caipirinha , Brazil’s national cocktail, which is a popular showcase for the spirit. But cachaça is available in more forms than the clear, unaged version found in Caipirinhas. Darker expressions are aged in barrels for anywhere from one to seven years, taking on rich, nuanced flavors that add complexity to drinks. Dragos Axinte, the founder and CEO of cachaça brand Novo Fogo, describes the pride that his country takes in its indigenous spirit. “Brazil has embraced cachaça so much that the rest of the world is taking notice,” he says. “Cachaça, though not yet as popular in the U.S. as it has the potential to be, is one of the most consumed spirits in the world.” The Brazilian Buck is a take on the classic Buck , a cocktail template that calls for a spirit, citrus and either ginger ale or ginger beer. It features Novo Fogo’s Chameleon expression, which is aged in used bourbon barrels for one year, plus ginger beer, lime juice and aromatic bitters. The barrels impart subtle hints of vanilla and oak to the spirit, adding depth to the refreshing, citrusy character of the cocktail. Build the drink in a highball glass with ice, no shaking required.

The fortified wine varies by style and producer, but most vermouths feature a profile that is herbal, botanical and floral, some showcasing hints of bitterness, while others lean toward the sweeter end of the spectrum. Vermouth is a workhorse in drinks, but sometimes what one vermouth can’t do, two can accomplish. One Last Midnight is a spirit-forward drink created by Meaghan Dorman, the bar director of Dear Irving in New York City. She employs aged Venezuelan rum and two Italian sweet vermouths: one rich and lush, one more bitter and nearly amaro-like. The drink also sees a spritz of smoky Islay scotch and a pinch of coffee-infused salt. The combination works. Blending vermouths has a long history. In the 1800s, there was plenty of subpar vermouth, which led enterprising bartenders to doctor bottles with spices, wine or spirits. This made the liquid taste better, but it also achieved a particular flavor profile. Today, you don’t need to start with bad vermouth to experiment with blending. Choose a couple of vermouths you like, and note how they differ. Combine them to find balance between sweet, dry and bitter, and you might find a new favorite flavor to sip or use in cocktails.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/blue-hawaii/,Blue Hawaii,Liquor.com,"The Blue Hawaii cocktail—not to be confused with the similarly named Blue Hawaiian —was born at Honolulu’s Kaiser Hawaiian Village (now Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Resort). In 1957, a sales representative of Dutch distiller Bols asked legendary bartender Harry Yee to design a drink that featured the brand's blue curaçao, a Caribbean liqueur made using the dried peel of the Laraha citrus fruit. After experimenting with several variations, Yee settled on a cocktail that featured rum, vodka, blue curaçao, pineapple and sweet-and-sour mix. The drink is still recognized today for its signature blue color, pineapple wedge and cocktail umbrella garnish. In fact, it's Yee who is largely credited with popularizing the now iconic trend of miniature cocktail umbrellas in cocktails by including them in his creations. The Blue Hawaii is typically shaken with ice and strained into a tall glass, but it can also be prepared by blending all of the ingredients together—Yee is said to have varied his method per the guest’s preference. Both options taste great, though the frozen version may prove extra refreshing on a hot day. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog The Blue Hawaii recipe calls for sweet-and-sour mix, and you can certainly choose one of the bottled products available at liquor stores and grocery stores. But if you’re game to make your own—a very simple task—you’ll create a fresher tasting cocktail. All it takes is sugar, water and lime juice. The Blue Hawaii has enjoyed a place in popular culture. Its invention predates Hawaii’s statehood by two years, and it is the most famous drink associated with the Aloha State. It was Yee who named the cocktail that shares its name with the 1961 Elvis Presley film. And since the drink’s debut, there have been numerous variations on the recipe, such as the Blue Hawaiian , which uses crème de coconut.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/longshoreman/,Longshoreman,Liquor.com,"Invented around 1880 at New York City’s Manhattan Club, the Manhattan has enjoyed its status as a universally respected cocktail since its inception. The original formula of whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters is great the way it is. But even great drinks inspire variations, as bartenders experiment with ingredients and ratios to produce creative yet recognizable variations on the standard. The Longshoreman is one such example. It was invented by New Orleans bartender Abigail Gullo , who keeps the whiskey firmly in place but thoughtfully chooses a particular vermouth and subs bitter liqueur for aromatic bitters. Punt e Mes is an Italian vermouth whose name translates to “point and a half,” referring to the bottle containing one point of sweetness and half point of bitterness. It has a strong and distinctive flavor and adds a hint of richness to classic cocktails like the Manhattan and Negroni . Gullo’s third ingredient is Averna, a Sicilian amaro that plays the role usually assumed by Angostura bitters. Averna is bittersweet, earthy and herbaceous, with notes of candied orange peel and caramel. It’s a common sidekick to whiskey (sub Averna for vermouth and keep the bitters for a Black Manhattan) that adds viscosity and weight to this cocktail. Gullo uses a full half ounce of the liqueur rather than the typical two or three dashes of bitters you find in most Manhattans. Finally, she enlists a flamed orange peel, which adds a bit of flair, as well as a burned citrus finish, to the Longshoreman. Follow her lead and impress your friends with some zesty pyrotechnics.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/a-la-louisiane/,A La Louisiane,Liquor.com,"New Orleans is a generous city. Its hospitality extends far beyond Bourbon Street and beignets to a host of classic cocktails, including city favorites turned global sensations like the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz. One drink, however, doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. The A La Louisiane (sometimes called De La Louisiane) is the former house drink of historic New Orleans’ restaurant La Louisiane, which was built in 1881. The cocktail is a variation on the Vieux Carré , a heady mix of rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth, Bénédictine and bitters. This variation intensifies the rye, skips the cognac and calls for a few dashes of absinthe, producing a drink that is familiar but unique. The cocktail first appeared in “Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix ’Em,” a 1937 book by Stanley Clisby Arthur. Like many drinks of the era, it all but disappeared through the decades, but it regained a foothold after appearing in “The PDT Cocktail Book” by Jim Meehan, a 2011 tome that detailed recipes from the popular New York speakeasy-style bar. Though the A La Louisiane has not reached the heights of its whiskey-laced cousins like the Sazerac or Vieux Carré, it’s once again being made in select bars inside and outside of New Orleans. The drink begins with rye whiskey and sweet vermouth, a friendly duo that should appeal to Manhattan drinkers. From there, the herbal flavors can be punched up or scaled back depending on the amount of Bénédictine, Peychaud’s bitters and absinthe you use, but this recipe points you in the right direction.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/waldorf/,Waldorf,Kevin Gray,"A relative of the Manhattan , the Waldorf was first created in the early 20th century at the old Waldorf hotel (now the Waldorf-Astoria) in New York City. The original hotel was demolished in 1929, but the drink lives on thanks to craft cocktail pioneer Dale DeGroff, who adapted the recipe to the modern palate. The original recipe, which appeared in “ The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book ” by Albert Stevens Crockett, combined equal parts rye, vermouth and absinthe. That is a boozy drink and a lot of absinthe, which can be a challenging flavor for some drinkers. If you like absinthe and want to try the original, go for it. However, DeGroff’s version has become the preferred recipe during the modern era. It dials down the absinthe, opting for a quick rinse of the glass rather than a full pour. And the recipe borrows from the classic Manhattan by increasing the ratio of whiskey to vermouth. Manhattan drinkers will notice the familiar taste of rye, sweet vermouth and aromatic bitters, but that small kick of absinthe shouldn’t be overlooked. It takes the cocktail in a new direction with its herbal, anise-flavored accent. With so many great rye whiskeys and sweet vermouths on the market, the Waldorf is a prime candidate for experimentation—similar to how you might mix and match your ingredients when stirring a Manhattan. A soft, 80-proof rye and a straightforward vermouth will provide a relatively tame drink, while a bold, spicy, overproof rye whiskey and a richer, more herbal vermouth can produce a deeply complex cocktail. There’s no right or wrong way.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/remember-the-maine/,Remember the Maine,Alex Frane,"If you appreciate a good Manhattan —a rye Manhattan specifically—then the Remember the Maine should likely find a home in your drinks repertoire. At first glance, the historic cocktail appears to be a direct adaptation of the famed whiskey drink. But it draws from two sources: both the Manhattan and the New Orleans classic the Sazerac , as the Remember the Maine also includes absinthe. Remember the Maine comes from Charles H. Baker, Jr’s. “The Gentleman’s Companion” from 1939. “Treat this one with the respect it deserves, gentlemen,” the description reads. It also describes the bombs reportedly going off around Baker as a prelude to the Cuban uprising of 1933, which was happening as he first sampled the cocktail in Havana. The cocktail’s name, however, refers to the sinking of the United States’ battleship of the same name which was sunk many years earlier in Havana Harbor, which helped lead to the Spanish-American War. The rallying call of “Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!” was a common refrain at the time. Despite its somewhat confusing history combining the Spanish-American War and the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the drink became a classic because of its rich, bold and herbaceous qualities. Like a Sazerac, it starts with an absinthe-rinsed glass, though a stemmed one rather than a rocks glass. From there, it resembles a Manhattan or a Red Hook , combining rye whiskey, sweet vermouth and cherry liqueur. The Remember the Maine specifically calls for Heering cherry liqueur, a sweeter, redder cherry liqueur that’s been around more than a century. You could, instead, use a cherry brandy as the recipe originally called for in “The Gentleman’s Companion,” but these days most versions of the drink call for Heering. If you want to be even more accurate to Baker’s original recipe, be sure to stir the drink in a clockwise fashion as you make it—according to its author, that makes it “sea-worthy,” like its namesake.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/old-pal/,Old Pal,Liquor.com,"The classic Negroni has crossed the lips of millions of drinkers since it was created in Italy in the early 20th century. Like many beloved drinks, it has also hatched too many variations to count, from simple spirit swaps to more elaborate divergences. One of the most successful variations is the Boulevardier , a drink created in the 1920s by famed bartender and author Harry MacElhone of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. This is not that; this is the Old Pal, an offshoot of the Boulevardier that was also first stirred by MacElhone around the same time. As the story goes, MacElhone named the cocktail for William “Sparrow” Robinson, the sports editor for The New York Herald in Paris. The Boulevardier features bourbon, Campari and sweet vermouth in a whiskey-spiked tweak to the Negroni, while the Old Pal follows suit by requesting rye whiskey and Campari. But, notably, the Old Pal calls for dry vermouth. The three-ingredient drink is still spirit-forward and potent, but given the lighter choice of vermouth and the zesty lemon peel garnish, it drinks lighter than its richer sibling. The classic Old Pal recipe is built with equal parts of each ingredient, just like the Negroni. However, some modern recipes increase the rye whiskey while decreasing both the Campari and dry vermouth. The latter formula is often made in a 2:1:1 ratio for a slightly boozier take on the original.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/scofflaw/,Scofflaw,Gary Regan,"Next time you visit your favorite speakeasy-style watering hole, you might want to make the experience more authentic by ordering what most people actually drank during Prohibition. (And remember: Back then, the peephole on the front door served a purpose—to stave off the cops long enough to hide the booze.) So if you desire a true speakeasy drink, you can have either a glass of Champagne or a Ginger Ale Highball . That’s about it. All that talk of the fabulous cocktails made in the midst of Prohibition in order to mask the flavors of badly made alcohol is wrong. When your drinking experience is an illegal one, you just want to get down to drinking. While the Scofflaw was invented during the Noble Experiment, it didn’t rear its head in some subterranean dive in Chicago. It was reportedly a creation of a bartender named Jock at Harry’s New York Bar—in Paris. The recipe was a result of the word “scofflaw” coming to prominence on January 15, 1924. It won a contest held by prohibitionist Delcevare King that asked people to coin a term to describe the lawless drinker, “to stab awake the conscience.” The word, I think, is pretty neat, but I’m not sure how many consciences were stabbed awake by it. According to drinks historian David Wondrich, as far as he can tell, the only surviving drink that can lay legitimate claim to having been dreamed up in the U.S. while the Great Drought was on is the French 75. At the time, the name was used for a few different potions, but the standard formula ended up being a pretty simple affair incorporating gin (not cognac), lemon juice, sugar and Champagne. Originally, the Scofflaw called for “1/3 rye whiskey, 1/3 French vermouth, 1/6 lemon juice and 1/6 grenadine.” That doesn’t do much for me, so I played around with it.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/monte-carlo/,Monte Carlo,Liquor.com,"The Manhattan dates back to the late 19th century, and seemingly since its invention, barkeeps and drinkers have been experimenting with the classic formula of whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters. It’s not because the classic needs tweaking—the Manhattan has proved itself a well-balanced winner, enjoyed by countless people around the world. Instead, it’s because the three-part recipe is ripe for riffing, as spirit swaps and subtle tweaks can create new iterations that are equally worthy. The Monte Carlo is one of those riffs. Its origin is unknown, but the drink features rye whiskey, Benedictine and aromatic bitters and first appeared in print in 1948 as part of David Embury’s “ The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks .” Benedictine, which takes the place of vermouth, is a French liqueur made from a secret blend of 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon, fir cones and juniper. This particular adaptation comes from Michael Dietsch’s book, “ Whiskey: A Spirited Story with 75 Classic & Original Cocktails .” It features slightly updated proportions, but the flavor profile remains the same. When choosing your rye, Dietsch suggests using something with heft to it, like Rittenhouse, which clocks in at 100 proof. Its higher alcohol content and spicier profile helps to balance the sweet Benedictine. Once you’ve got your bottle in hand, stir together the three ingredients, then serve in a rocks glass over a large ice cube—no garnish necessary. The Monte Carlo is not a Manhattan, but it will remind of the classic drink while providing a flavor all its own. 20 Rye Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, Benedictine and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir for about 30 seconds until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled rocks glass over a large ice cube.']",73,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/new-york-sour/,New York Sour,Kevin Gray,"A traditional sour is composed of spirit, citrus and sugar (and sometimes egg white) and accounts for many of the best known cocktails in rotation today. The esteemed group includes seemingly disparate classics like the Daiquiri, Pisco Sour and Whiskey Sour , so it’s a varied bunch. The Whiskey Sour comes from the mid-19th century and is believed to have first appeared in print in the 1862 edition of the famed “Jerry Thomas Bartenders Guide.” In addition to being one of America’s great cocktail inventions, the Whiskey Sour has persevered through time and is still beloved. It has spawned numerous variations, but perhaps none so popular as the New York Sour. The New York Sour updates the Whiskey Sour recipe (whiskey, lemon, sugar, egg white) with a float of dry red wine. The wine lends its aromatic qualities and deep red color to the drink. Reports trace the New York Sour back to the 1870s or 1880s, although it operated under other names during this time, including the Continental Sour. It’s possible that the New York Sour was created in Chicago, but in time, the New York label grabbed on and never let go. This recipe comes from Allen Katz, the co-founder of New York Distilling Company and a leading expert on spirits and cocktails. He suggests either rye whiskey or bourbon as your base. A rye-spiked sour will feature more prominent spice notes than the bourbon version, but both spirits perform admirably. From there, fresh lemon juice and simple syrup keep the cocktail balanced while the egg white adds a silky texture and frothy head. Finally, red wine is slowly floated on top, providing a striking visual in addition to its dry and fruity flavor. The New York Sour is one of those cocktails that is relatively simple to execute, yet looks impressive and tastes complex. So, it has all the hallmarks you want when shaking drinks, whether you’re flying solo or serving a crowd.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/greenpoint/,Greenpoint,Liquor.com,"The Manhattan was first stirred together in its eponymous New York City borough around 1880. Since then, it has spawned countless variations, many of which are classics in their own right. Those variations include a family of cocktails named for other NYC boroughs, like the Bronx and the Brooklyn. Dive even deeper into this family, and you find a third level of recipes representing specific neighborhoods within those boroughs. The Greenpoint is a variation on the Brooklyn (rye, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur, Amer Picon). It was created at NYC’s legendary Milk & Honey bar by Michael McIlroy in 2006 and named for the Brooklyn nabe. It keeps the same general template of spirit, vermouth, liqueur and bitters, but with a couple changes. It calls for sweet vermouth rather than dry, and the bittersweet cherry-flavored maraschino and the French aperitif Amer Picon are removed in favor of yellow Chartreuse, a French herbal liqueur. Yellow Chartreuse has been made by Carthusian Monks since 1838 using a closely guarded recipe of 130 herbs, plants and flowers. It, with notes of honey, citrus, anise and saffron, is sweeter and softer than its green sibling . In the Greenpoint cocktail, those flavors merge with rye whiskey’s spicy grain character and the herbal, floral sweet vermouth. Two types of bitters—aromatic and orange—provide additional flavor and structure. The Greenpoint is just one example of the endless opportunities available to play with both the Manhattan and the Brooklyn. When you start with whiskey and vermouth, you’re starting in a good place. Add an interesting liqueur like yellow Chartreuse, and you get a modern-classic cocktail with bold character indicative of the neighborhood it evokes, a place where old-school community meets a flourishing creative scene. 20 Rye Whiskey Cocktails to Try Today RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'yellow Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, yellow Chartreuse, sweet vermouth and both bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe or cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",86,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-ale-highball/,Ginger Ale Highball,Liquor.com,"You don’t need small-batch spirits, rare liqueurs or esoteric bitters to make a good cocktail. You don’t even need citrus or other fruits. Sometimes, simplicity is what’s required, and joining two ingredients is all it takes to create a delicious, well-balanced drink. Look at the Gin & Tonic . And then look at the Ginger Ale Highball, a ridiculously easy-to-make cooler combining rye whiskey and ginger ale. The Ginger Ale Highball works because it pairs the spicy notes of rye whiskey with the spicy-sweet effervescence of ginger ale. The ingredients were made for each other (although, to be fair, there’s not a lot that whiskey couldn’t be paired with). And the result is a drink that’s refreshing and thirst-quenching with just the right amount of bite. While the traditional choice for this cocktail is rye, bourbon or other American whiskeys can do the job. A high-rye Canadian whisky could also work in a pinch, but the key is to choose a spirit with enough oomph to announce its presence rather than be overpowered by the ginger. Store-bought ginger ale is all you need to make this recipe. So, if you’ve got that, you’re set. But if you feel like putting in a little effort, you can always make your own ginger simple syrup and top the drink with sparkling water for a similar effect. Or if you want to increase the spice quotient, you can also try making DIY ginger beer —it’s just ginger, water and sugar, plus a little lime juice—but this will create a slightly different tasting version than the classic. The whole point of drinking a two-ingredient cocktail is that you don’t have to think about it. So, when in doubt, don’t try too hard. Pour some whiskey and ginger ale into a glass with ice, find a comfortable chair and sip slowly as you watch the world go by. 7 Rye Whiskey Cocktails That Will Put a Smile on Your Face RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ginger ale'}]","['Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the rye whiskey.', 'Top with the ginger ale, and stir gently.']",189,whiskey

An excerpt from the tome, penned by Death & Co owners Alex Day and David Kaplan, alongside writer Nick Fauchald, explains the cocktail in succinct terms: “The classic Presbyterian is similar to the Moscow Mule and the Dark and Stormy, being simply spirit combined with ginger ale.” While the Death & Co specs include rye, soda, ginger syrup and fresh lemon and lime juice, Liquor.com’s is a more simplified version that allows its drinker the choice between Scotch whisky, bourbon or rye, which is then topped with both ginger ale and club soda. The 20 Best Scotch Whisky Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE Using this recipe, one could also liken the Presbyterian to a highball with an added layer of ginger. Whichever way you look at it, there are a few tricks to making the most of your drink, from ice to straw and everything in between. On the subject of ice, there’s a lot more to it than one might think. In the case of the Presbyterian, you’ll want to use a tall, cylindrical highball or Collins glass and a spear-shaped block of ice, which will dilute more slowly than multiple smaller cubes. You will also want to use high-quality sodas , such as Thomas Henry, Q Mixers or Fever Tree, as well as, optimally, a reusable straw for the environment’s sake. If you choose to garnish your Presbyterian, citrus would be a great option.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ward-eight/,Ward Eight,Liquor.com,"The Ward Eight, a turn-of-the-20th century concoction, is one of Boston’s major contributions to craft cocktails. The cocktail was reportedly created in 1898 in Boston to celebrate the election of one Martin M. Lomasney to the state legislature. Lomasney was a politician who wielded considerable power in Boston for 40 years, serving as a state senator and representative as well as a political “boss” in the city’s eighth ward. The drink, by all accounts, was created at the Locke-Ober Café in Boston’s eighth ward. Already nearly 20 years old when the drink was created there, the venerable French restaurant and bar survived until 2012, when it finally closed. As with any drink that old that wasn’t written down at the time, there are different approaches to crafting it, but the most popular is a mix of rye whiskey, lemon and orange juices and grenadine, which is what author and cocktail historian David Wondrich specifies in his rendition here. Some stories describe the creation of the Ward Eight as happening before Lomasney officially won his election, so sure was the bar staff that he would do so. Many stories abound about the questionable nature as to his victory, including tales of him handing out pre-filled ballots to voters entering the polls. Regardless of would-be shifty dealings, the man was a popular politician. Essentially a riff on a rye Whiskey Sour, the Ward Eight sees some of the lemon juice substituted with orange, and simple syrup is replaced by grenadine. For decades, Rose’s grenadine dominated the market, with most people associating the pomegranate-flavored bar syrup with a cloying concoction of corn syrup and artificial flavors and colors. Today, as in much of the bar world, there are options, including a number of grenadine brands made with real fruit juice. However, for those who can’t find a favorite bottle on the shelves, or those who are feeling DIY-y, you can make your own homemade grenadine either with freshly juiced pomegranates or store-bought juice. The Ward Eight calls for a mere two teaspoons of the sweet-tart pomegranate syrup. Adding vodka to the grenadine keeps it shelf-stable for much longer, but for those who want to use it quickly, there’s always the Jack Rose , the Tequila Sunrise and the Shirley Temple. Just be sure not to use a vodka-infused version if making a Shirley Temple or one of its non-alcoholic variations.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cherries', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, lemon and orange juices and grenadine to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with speared cherries.']",52,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/boilermaker/,Boilermaker,Liquor.com,"If you want an unfussy drink that knows how to get the job done, go old-school with a Boilermaker. This straightforward whiskey and beer concoction, wherein the whiskey is dropped into the beer, found favor in the 1800s among factory workers—possibly those who fabricated the boilers of locomotive engines, hence the name. After coming off long, exhausting shifts, they understandably wanted a strong end to their day. That’s a nice origin story, and it may be the advent of the glass-in-a-glass combination. But it’s likely that people have been combining liquor and beer in some fashion ever since the two drinks entered ready circulation. There’s no rule saying which type of beer you should choose when making a Boilermaker, and clearly this isn’t an elaborate, thoughtful cocktail. So, the standard advice applies: Choose whatever you like to drink. However, certain liquors do pair better with certain beers. A classic bourbon or rye whiskey works well with a light lager, while bold Irish whiskeys enjoy the extra flavor of an IPA. Whiskey in general is the classic choice when drinking Boilermakers, but many bars serve a lineup of different beer-and-shot pairings . Don’t sleep on tequila dropped into a Mexican lager, or herbal, bitter amari (or malty genever) served with a crisp pilsner. Your options are plentiful and worth exploring. Those options extend to drinking process itself, as there are multiple ways to down a Boilermaker. Typically, you fill a pint glass halfway with beer, drop a shot straight into the glass, and then slam the contents in one go. It’s a fun way to consume a drink, especially if you’re with a lively group of like-minded friends. But you can also dump the liquor into the beer, keeping the shot glass out of your pint. Or serve the beer and shot separately, shooting the liquor and then chasing it with the beer. Each method results in you quickly consuming both drinks, so it’s a matter of personal preference. Order a Boilermaker at your local dive, and the barkeep is almost certainly going to serve the two drinks separately. It’s then on you to choose your own adventure. Of course, you can also just pour a beer and a shot and drink them side-by-side, at your leisure, no dropping or chugging required. That’s not a Boilermaker, but it is an undeniably fine way to go.

https://www.liquor.com/bensonhurst-cocktail-recipe-6665952,Bensonhurst,Liquor.com,"The Bensonhurst is among the many modern-classic variations on the Brooklyn cocktail (itself a riff on a Manhattan ) named for the borough’s various neighborhoods. It was created by bartender Chad Solomon in 2006, who was working at both Milk & Honey and Pegu Club in New York City at the time. “I was inspired to create the Bensonhurst as an alternative to the Brooklyn cocktail, partly because of the lack of original-formula Amer Picon,” Solomon is quoted as saying in Regarding Cocktails by Sasha Petraske. Vincenzo Errico had created the Red Hook at Milk & Honey a couple of years earlier as the first of the Brooklyn variations, “which set the precedent of choosing other Brooklyn neighborhoods to name the variations it spawned,” says Solomon. Solomon’s riff takes its name from the traditionally Italian neighborhood in south Brooklyn, which he lived near at the time. It’s a particularly appropriate choice, as his Brooklyn riff differentiates itself by calling for Cynar, a bitter Italian liqueur, to replace the Amer Picon. Otherwise, the cocktail is in fact more faithful to the original Brooklyn recipe than are many of its borough-named brethren. It retains its predecessor’s rye whiskey and dry vermouth in the same quantities. The maraschino liqueur is still there, but dropped back in quantity slightly. And, addressing the unavailability of Amer Picon, the French liqueur is swapped out for Cynar, an amaro made with artichokes, its earthy bittersweetness replacing the Amer Picon’s bitter orange notes.

https://www.liquor.com/large-format-red-hook-cocktail-recipe-5075841,Large-Format Red Hook,Liquor.com,"Order a stirred cocktail like a Manhattan or Martini at a bar, and the overwhelming likelihood is that the bartender will be quick to pour the ingredients into a cocktail mixing glass, top it with a large scoop of cracked ice, and stir it with a long-handled barspoon before straining it into a chilled glass. Speed and precision are the hallmarks of a good bartender, and beyond efficiency, it can also be an impressive thing to watch. But sometimes even the most efficient of bartenders can’t keep up with the demands of a busy rush. Other times, a bar team might need to dial in its consistency on a particular drink. Or, for home bartenders and party hosts, sometimes you don’t want to spend the entire evening in the bar or kitchen, painstakingly mixing up drinks and invariably running out of ice. In any case, the answer is premixing and pre-diluting a large batch of cocktails. Once seen as something to be looked down upon, it’s now an accepted style of bartending for its consistency, speed, and quality assurances. Once the batch is mixed and chilled, all you need to do is pour it into a glass, which makes it a wise idea for anyone hosting a party. Laura Newman, the beverage director at Queen’s Park in Birmingham, Alabama, contributed this large-format version of a Red Hook cocktail. A variation on the classic Manhattan, the Red Hook offers drinkers a bit of extra complexity with the addition of cherry liqueur; in this recipe, Newman opts for Luxardo, easily the most established brand of maraschino liqueur, immediately recognizable by its wicker wrapping. She also calls for Rittenhouse Rye, an affordable, 100-proof, rye-forward whiskey. Both or either can be substituted for a similar product, but make sure to stick with rye rather than using bourbon, or else the drink can become too sweet. The Large-Format Red Hook makes five servings—perfect for capping off a small dinner party or mixing on a Sunday evening. After batching and diluting, it needs to be chilled for at least 5 hours, so don’t make it at the last minute before a party. The nice thing is that the added water means it doesn’t need to be stirred over any ice—just pour into a chilled glass and serve.

This favorite fall beverage pops up each year as the weather begins to cool, satisfying crowds with its delicious combination of sweet, tart and spice. You can enjoy it on its own, of course, but should you desire a higher octane serving, you can blast it with a dose of liquor. The Stone Fence Cocktail is a simple mix of apple cider, Angostura bitters and the spirit of your choice. American whiskeys like bourbon and rye are natural pairings with cider, lending notes of vanilla, caramel and baking spices to the concoction. Rum is another fine choice, and depending which rum you choose, you can infuse the drink with rich sweetness or dry, grassy notes. Then there’s brandy, a versatile spirit that brings extra fruit and oak; choose apple brandy to double down on the apple flavors. The Stone Fence proves that cocktails don’t need to be complicated to be delicious. The spirit, apple cider and bitters trio yields a superbly flavorful autumnal cocktail . The best part: This drink is exceedingly easy to make. Build it straight in your glass with a generous helping of ice, then place a mint sprig on top for additional aromatics with each sip. Do that, and you’ve got everything you need for a refreshing fall drink, whether you’re hosting a backyard gathering, toting a thermos to a harvest festival or watching football on your couch.

Of course, the same can be said for a refreshing cocktail. Fortunately, you don’t have to choose one or the other when beer cocktails are an option. Washington, D.C., restaurant and bar Roofers Union gets high marks for its beer program, so it’s little surprise that some suds have bled into the cocktail list. As the drink’s name would suggest, the Here Comes the Sun is bright in both color and flavor. Rye whiskey lends a spice and depth that play well with the homemade ginger syrup and fresh lemon juice. For the beer, Roofers Union chooses Port City Brewing Optimal Wit, a Belgian-style white ale from Alexandria, Virginia that is crisp, citrusy and peppery. If you can’t find Optimal Wit, a different high-quality wheat beer will get the job done. The beer adds body and a refreshingly fizzy mouthfeel to the drink.

The Brooklyn features rye whiskey, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur and Amer Picon, a French aperitif that’s difficult to source in the U.S. and often requires a substitute ingredient that approximates its flavor. Despite its fussy nature, the Brooklyn has spawned its own riffs, including neighborhood-specific drinks like the Greenpoint and Red Hook. The Red Hook calls for rye whiskey, maraschino liqueur and Punt e Mes, an Italian vermouth whose name translates to “point and a half,” referring to the bottle containing one point of sweetness and one point of bitterness. The cocktail was created by Vincenzo Errico at the famed Milk & Honey bar in 2003 and has become one of the most enduring contemporary cocktails, popping up at bars across the country. With its well-balanced profile that merges a stout whiskey base with bittersweet vermouth and dry cherry liqueur, the Red Hook has a complex flavor that belies its subtle twist on the classic Manhattan and Brooklyn.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/embarcadero/,Embarcadero,Liquor.com,"The Embarcadero is a San Francisco take on the Boulevardier —an elegant trifecta of flavors, balancing bittersweet liqueur, botanical vermouth and warm whiskey spice. It was created by Claire Sprouse, an award-winning bartender with accolades from Tales of the Cocktail and Food & Wine and the founder of the former Brooklyn all-day cafe and bar Hunky Dory. Prior to this, Sprouse worked in San Francisco, where she managed the cocktail bar Rickhouse and worked with the opening team at ABV. Inspired by San Francisco, Sprouse uses Lo-Fi amaro and vermouth in the Embarcadero. Based in the Bay Area, the Lo-Fi label produces two vermouths and an amaro and was partly developed by Sprouse herself. The base of each bottle is a wine made with exclusively Californian grapes, most of them from Napa. Unlike traditional dark-red sweet vermouths, the Lo-Fi sweet vermouth differentiates itself with its pale gold hue stemming from its white-wine base. The botanical blend, too, is unique, with rhubarb, cocoa, cloves, coriander, cardamom, gentian, dried fruit and other natural ingredients, all displayed on the bottle with a stylish label. Boulevardier RELATED ARTICLE Rather than the Campari used in a Boulevardier, the Embarcadero employs Lo-Fi’s Gentian Amaro. This bright, ruby-red, bittersweet liqueur gives the drink a vibrant orange flush when combined with the other ingredients. Like the sweet vermouth, the amaro is a unique blend of herbs, spices, fruits, and other natural ingredients, including anise, hibiscus, grapefruit, ginger and, of course, gentian. While the choice of rye whiskey is up to your personal preference, there’s not much flexibility with the recipe, given the specificity of the vermouth and amaro and the way they define the drink. If liquor stores in your market don’t carry the Lo-Fi line of products, the bottles are available online at a variety of stores.

The name “buck” refers to a style of cocktail that contains a spirit, citrus and either ginger ale or ginger beer. The first bucks date back to the mid-1800s and were typically spiked with whiskey, but any spirit works. If you’ve ever had a Moscow Mule (vodka), a Dark ’n Stormy (rum) or an Irish Buck (Irish whiskey), then you’re familiar with the category’s charms. Bucks are easy to make and endlessly customizable, which makes them a popular choice at home and on bar menus. A typical Whiskey Ginger can be built right in your glass, but the Northern Harvest Buck calls for the rye and lime juice to be shaken with ice. Once the contents are strained into a highball glass, the drink is topped with Angostura bitters and chilled ginger beer. That combo gives the drink a lush golden hue. Garnish with a mint sprig and lemon wheel for additional visuals and aromatics. After one sip, you’ll see how quaffable the cocktail is, and you may start breaking it out when friends arrive, on game days or whenever you have a patio and time to kill.

The Tootsie Roll cocktail is a more serious affair than the name implies. Rather than relying on flavored vodka or chocolate syrup to achieve the desired taste, Sharpe enlists the intensely sweet, dark, dessert-like Pedro Ximénez sherry. The sherry is tempered by the spicy rye, and the bitters—made from organic toasted cacao nibs with just a hint of oak—impart chocolate notes into the drink without increasing the sweetness.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/monte-cassino/,Monte Cassino,Liquor.com,"If you’ve ever had a classic Last Word , you know the kind of nuanced flavor profile that comes with combining green Chartreuse with citrus, a spirit and another distinct liqueur (lime, gin and Maraschino, respectively). It’s a drink unlike any other, and thanks to its unique nature, the Last Word has inspired countless riffs over the years. Take the Monte Cassino, for example: Created in 2010 by New York City bartender Damon Dyer, this variation uses yellow Chartreuse , Benedictine , American rye whiskey and freshly squeezed lemon juice, and it’s every bit as satisfying as its inspiration. Dyer’s Monte Cassino draws its name from Benedictine’s rich and fascinating history, which, like Chartreuse, is connected to centuries of production by monks (Monte Cassino in Italy is where the Benedictine Order is said to have been founded). Because the Benedictine takes the place of the usual maraschino cherry liqueur in a Last Word, the Monte Cassino is even more botanical-forward and herbal than its inspiration. To balance that, the gin is also swapped out, with American rye whiskey taking its place. The whiskey adds a warmth and gentle spice to the cocktail, making it more lush and rich than the original. Also like a Last Word, the Monte Cassino looks odd on paper, as equal parts of whiskey, yellow Chartreuse, Benedictine and lemon juice is an intimidating mix. But the marriage of these four ingredients creates a result greater than the individual parts, with lemon juice helping to brighten and enliven the darker, richer spirits as well as balance their sweetness. The cocktail is also a stunner to look at, all bright-gold and refreshing looking. It may not replace the Last Word as your go-to aperitif, but it’s possible.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/summer-rye/,Summer Rye,Liquor.com,"With elderflower, Fuji apple, rye whiskey and Champagne, the Summer Rye is an appropriately named cocktail. However, this drink from bartender and brand educator Willy Shine is just as good in fall, winter and spring as it is in the summer months. Shine opts for Sazerac rye whiskey as the base of the Summer Rye. This historic rye brand from New Orleans is made at Buffalo Trace distillery, and has its own unique rye profile with bold, spicy rye notes and a somewhat subdued alcohol level. Generally retailing around $30 for a 750-milliliter bottle, it’s a great whiskey for the price point, enjoyable in cocktails like the Summer Rye as well as on its own. And given its name and heritage, it’s no surprise that it makes an excellent Sazerac . But if you’ve got another rye at home or a personal favorite, feel free to substitute. Rather than relying only on simple syrup for sweetness, Shine uses St-Germain elderflower liqueur. This floral and fruity liqueur was so ubiquitous in the early days of the so-called Cocktail Renaissance of the mid-to-late 2000s that it was given the moniker “Bartender’s Ketchup.” It’s no afterthought in the Summer Rye, with the liqueur’s notes of white flowers evoking the breeze of a summer’s day, especially when paired with apple. While a commonplace liqueur on bar shelves, it now has a few marketplace competitors, including Drillaurd and St Elder. More specific is the apple juice used. Rather than any store-bought apple cider, the Summer Rye calls for fresh-pressed Fuji apple juice. Though the apple variety’s origins are in Japan, its popularity sees it in markets across the world, including the U.S. Despite the drink’s name, finding fresh apple juice is easiest in fall, especially at farmers markets and apple orchards. Otherwise, substituting another kind of fresh apple juice is acceptable in a pinch. Finally, the drink is topped with Champagne. The recipe calls for only 3/4 an ounce of Champagne, which means opening a full bottle of expensive French bubbly for just a few drinks leaves you with a lot of extra wine. While that’s certainly not the worst problem to have, it can be a bit pricey. Instead, feel free to replace the wine with a more affordable option. Cava, for instance, often has notes of citrus and apple that would pair well with the rest of the drink.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Sazerac rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain elderflower liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fuji apple juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Champagne, chilled'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: apple cubes', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, elderflower liqueur, simple syrup, lemon juice and Fuji apple juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with the Champagne.', 'Garnish with diced apple cubes.']",16,whiskey

So for football season, we asked a bartender from each NFL team’s hometown to provide the perfect cocktail to represent their team. Baltimore barkeep Aaron Joseph concocted the Black-Eyed Rye to rep his Ravens. “Before Prohibition, WWI and WWII, Maryland was one of the largest producers of rye in the country,” says Joseph. “Therefore, a cocktail inspired by the Baltimore Ravens can only be rye-based.

The easygoing cocktail is exactly what you want to drink during a football game.

https://www.liquor.com/storm-king-cocktail-recipe-6751860,Storm King,Kathryn Maier,"Storm King Art Center , for those unfamiliar, is a vast sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, about 60 miles north of New York City. It’s set among gently rolling forested hills and ringed with deciduous trees that famously turn varied brilliant hues in autumn, making that season a favorite time for many visitors. So it’s appropriate that the cocktail named for the art center is equally marvelous in autumn, a mix of blended Scotch whisky, nocino, Benedictine, and Angostura bitters, created by bartender Damon Boelte, a co-owner of Grand Army in Brooklyn, New York, for one of the bar’s early menus. It’s a spin on a Manhattan by way of both the Rob Roy and the Bobby Burns , and like the numerous Manhattan and Brooklyn cocktail offshoots that bear the names of various New York City neighborhoods, this one followed suit, heading a bit upstate for its moniker. “Storm King just made sense for this one, given the autumn visits and changing leaves,” says Boelte. “I love an autumnal landscape of food and beverages, and this cocktail really reflects that: earthy honey, baking spices, roasted nuts, and a suggestion of robust red wine,” says Boelte, describing the flavors that the drink’s components bring. It has the classic foundation of the Bobby Burns, he says, with the nocino adding “an esoteric twist of aged walnut” and a vermouth-like quality. “I'm a huge fan of Benedictine, and have also loved nocino for as long as I can remember,” he says. “And when visiting my friends at their farm in upstate New York where they make nocino, I was inspired to mix these ingredients together.” Boelte initially used Cutty Sark’s Prohibition Edition, bottled at 50% ABV, as the base of the cocktail, although any lightly peated and ideally higher-proof blended scotch will work. He recommends making your own nocino if you’re so inclined; if not, Nocino Della Cristina is “a beautiful product,” he says. The drink is equally versatile in the way it can be served. “This one feels just as at home served up or on the rocks,” says Boelte. “It also happens to be a great pairing with food.” But the most important pairing, according to Boelte, is people. “The Storm King, like most cocktails, should be enjoyed with a friend and garnished with a long, leisurely conversation.” Bobby Burns 72 ratings","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blended Scotch whisky (Cutty Sark Prohibition Edition is preferred)'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'nocino'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: 3 brandied cherries, skewered', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with skewered brandied cherries.']",19,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/churchill-cocktail-recipe-6751481,Churchill,Audrey Morgan,"Winston Churchill is one of the most famous world leaders of all time, and he is also one of the most famous whisky drinkers . His taste for scotch was so well-known that legendary barman Joe Gilmore mixed up this whisky drink with sweet vermouth, Cointreau, and lime juice in honor of the prime minister at the Savoy hotel’s iconic American Bar in London. Churchill’s relationship with whisky began out of necessity, by his own account. “When I was a young subaltern in the South African war, the water was not fit to drink,” he said during a visit to the U.S., according to journalist and presidential daughter Margaret Truman . “To make it palatable, we had to add whisky. By diligent effort, I learned to like it.” Like it he did: Churchill drank Scotch whisky throughout the day, starting at breakfast time. When then-president Harry Truman offered him bourbon on a train ride, the prime minister reportedly had the train halted until a subordinate could pick up the nearest bottle of scotch . Barman Joe Gilmore was a legend in his own right. He worked at The Savoy hotel’s American Bar, the oldest surviving cocktail bar in London, from 1940 to 1976. There, he is said to have made drinks for celebrities including Neil Armstrong, Ernest Hemingway, and Frank Sinatra, but Gilmore had a particular fondness for Churchill: The prime minister enjoyed his own entrance at The Savoy and kept his own bottle of scotch behind the bar. Churchill even gifted Gilmore a cigar, which the bartender saved until it crumbled. Churchill did not, in fact, care much for cocktails, but that didn’t stop Gilmore from crafting a drink in honor of the statesman. For Churchill’s eponymous cocktail, Gilmore combined the politician’s beloved Scotch whisky with sweet vermouth, Cointreau, and fresh lime juice. The first printed recipe for the drink appeared in Esquire magazine in 1939. The spirit-forward scotch drink is sometimes called a Churchill Manhattan, but aside from the sweet vermouth used, it bears few similarities to its New York-named predecessor, which false tales have attributed to Churchill’s own mother. Besides calling for Scotch whisky rather than the Manhattan’s rye, it adds orange-flavored Cointreau and also lime juice, necessitating it be shaken rather than stirred as a Manhattan is. Churchill famously drank Johnnie Walker Red blended Scotch whisky , and that would be a fine choice to use here, but you can also try it with any blended scotch you happen to have on hand. The resulting drink is a fitting homage to one of Scotch whisky’s most fervent supporters. 20 Scotch Cocktails to Try Today RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blended scotch whisky'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.']",61,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/north-sea-oil-cocktail-recipe-6742780,North Sea Oil,Audrey Morgan,"Aquavit and Islay scotch are two spirits that don’t find their way into cocktails as often as many others—and certainly not together. Known for his innovative drinks, the vice president of food and beverage at Sydell Group and the NoMad Hotel Leo Robitschek employs both, along with Cocchi Americano and triple sec, in his spirit-forward North Sea Oil. The multilayered and complex cocktail, which he created at the bar at the now-shuttered NoMad hotel in New York City, is entirely Robitschek’s own. As he writes in his 2019 book The NoMad Cocktail Book , it “doesn’t quite fit any box.” As he notes in his book, Robitschek enjoys experimenting with split-base cocktails. “I am especially fond of combining liquors that seem as if they would not play well together,” he writes, citing his rum-and-rye Brown Sugar and tequila-and-sherry Paint It Black, in addition to the aquavit-and-scotch North Sea Oil. The Scandinavian spirit aquavit forms the primary base of the latter. A gin-like neutral alcohol distilled from grains or potatoes, aquavit is commonly flavored with herbs including caraway and dill. In Scandinavia, shots of the spirit are often served alongside a smorgasbord of food including bread, cheese, and cold fish dishes. For the North Sea Oil, Robitschek reaches for Norwegian Linie aquavit, which is made from potatoes and caraway seeds and matured in sherry casks. Because its flavor is so strong, a little Islay scotch goes a long way: See Sam Ross’s Penicillin and Audrey Saunders’s Dreamy Dorini Smoky Martini , both of which call for under an ounce of the spirit. For this drink, Robitschek employs a half-ounce of single malt Laphroaig whisky. Distilled on Islay, a small island off the southern coast of Scotland that is covered in peat, Laphroaig uses malt that is cold-smoked and dried over a peat fire, imparting a distinctive smoky flavor profile. If you substitute another single malt scotch, make sure to reach for a peat-forward bottle, preferably from Islay. The bittersweet Italian aromatized wine Cocchi Americano , which is often used in a Vesper , mellows the spirits and adds its citrusy and herbaceous notes. Triple sec, meanwhile, works as a sweetener and adds additional citrus notes. Whether you say skål or sláinte, the North Sea Oil proves that both aquavit and scotch have a place in your cocktail repertoire.

Of those, it’s closest to the rendition known as both the Jock Collins and the Sandy Collins, which calls for scotch whisky instead of gin. Despite its name, however, the egg white this cocktail calls for in fact renders it a fizz rather than a collins. And with its whisky base and addition of grapefruit juice, it takes on more than a hint of Brown Derby as well. The drink is truly in a category of its own with its unusual combination of ingredients. Scotch whisky and grapefruit juice aren’t often found together in a cocktail, especially in a fizz. Bitters are never unwelcome in cocktails, but as a rule, Collins drinks don’t call for them.

Chicago-based bartender Jesse Vanpoucke is fond of splitting the base in his Whiskey Sour between two whiskeys in order to lighten the drink’s profile. In the Big Red Sun, he uses Monkey Shoulder, a moderately priced and well-respected blended scotch, and Powers, a popular and affordable Irish whiskey. The alterations don’t stop with a split base of malt whiskeys, though. Vanpoucke punches up his take on the sour with some passion fruit in place of the simple syrup normally used to sweeten the drink. Notably he uses passion fruit liqueur, not the passion fruit syrup commonly found in Tiki bartending. Vanpoucke uses Giffard , but there are a few other brands including Chinola and Passoa . For extra sweetness he also uses a touch of vanilla syrup, while the requisite lemon juice balances the sweetness from the syrups. Finally, Vanpoucke adds bitters to the recipe, including Angostura and Bar Keep apple bitters from Greenbar Distillery in Los Angeles. The result is a complex and layered take on a classic. “What I love about this drink is how all the ingredients lean on each other—passion fruit to vanilla to light whiskey to apple,” says Vanpoucke. He quips that it’s also a nice hybrid drink if you happen to have brought a bottle of whiskey to a tropical island or an apple orchard. If you’re making this drink at home and don’t have access to the two brands that Vanpoucke uses as his base, feel free to swap them for another blended scotch whisky (Famous Grouse or Johnny Walker Black would fit well) and another Irish whiskey (household names like Jameson or Tullamore DEW will work just fine).

The Whiskey & Coke is as simple a two-ingredient drink as cocktails get, but ingredients and proportions still matter. As the drink’s name implies, its two components are Coca-Cola or any cola of your choice (though Coke’s relatively high acidity renders it a particularly good match against the liquor), plus any whiskey, though Jack Daniel’s seems to be by far the most popular option—which is then called, yes, a Jack & Coke or even a Lemmy, for the Motörhead frontman notoriously fond of the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/pickleback-recipe-5087251,Pickleback,H. Joseph Ehrmann,"“Pickle what?” That was my reaction when I first heard about the Pickleback. The drink, a shot of bourbon or Jameson Irish whiskey followed by a shot of pickle brine, has developed a cult following. It began as especially popular among New York City bartenders, who then spread pickle fever to other cities, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, San Francisco and even London. It’s not all that crazy when you put it into context. Russian and Nordic cultures have paired pickles and pickle brine with vodka for generations. I’ve been blending the brines of several pickled veggies for my Bloody Elixir for years. And of course, many Martini drinkers add a splash of olive brine to their cocktails. After much research—and many shots—I’ve traced the origins of the Pickleback to Brooklyn’s Bushwick Country Club. In 2006, neighbor McClure’s Pickles asked to store some inventory in the bar’s basement. The Country Club’s bartenders were also using the brand’s brine in some cocktails. One Sunday night, according to owner John Roberts, a customer asked for a shot of pickle juice to accompany her vodka. The order inspired bartender Reggie Cunningham to jokingly pair Old Crow bourbon with a shot of McClure’s spicy pickle juice instead of the traditional can of Pabst Blue Ribbon lager. But the reaction from patrons was no joke, and the bar started selling a lot of them. When the Ruotolo brothers brought the drink to their East Village bar, Whiskey Town, the recipe changed slightly, as Jameson replaced bourbon as the whiskey shot of choice. The briny creation was soon being served at other bars, including the now-closed Randolph and Rusty Knot. It can now be found far and wide. While bartenders use all sorts of pickle juices, Roberts remains a traditionalist. “If it’s not McClure’s, it’s not the same,” he says.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Jameson Irish whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'McClure’s pickle brine'}]","['Add the whiskey into a shot glass.', 'Add the pickle brine into a separate shot glass.', 'Instruct the drinker to take the whiskey as a shot, then the pickle brine as a chaser.']",159,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/whiskey-highball-cocktail-recipe-5085252,Whiskey Highball,Dylan Garret,"One of the most well-known examples of a broad style of cocktails called highballs , the Whiskey Highball comprises just a few simple ingredients: whiskey, soda water, and ice. However, its popularity shows that a drink with only a few ingredients can still showcase a range of complexity. Drinks in the highball template involve a base spirit combined with a mixer to lengthen, the latter of which is usually carbonated. The drink is built and served in a tall, comparatively narrow glass—the highball glass, or often a similarly shaped Collins glass—which gives ice ample contact with the liquid. This also allows for minimal agitation and creates a narrower opening, which some argue keeps the sparkling drink effervescent for longer by reducing the surface area of the drink. Highballs encompass a staggering array of popular drinks, from the Gin & Tonic to the Rum & Coke , Vodka Soda , and countless others. But the term highball itself, when used as a modifier, generally refers to a spirit mixed with soda water. While it’s nearly impossible to pin down the origins of who first mixed booze and bubbly water, the practice gained popularity with the industrialization of soda water production in the 1800s, which allowed seltzer to be created and bottled at scale. Some stories have it that the Brandy and Soda was a favored early combination, but the Scotch & Soda seems to be where the combination of whisky and sparkling water really took off in popular taste. Over the 20th century, as the distribution and reach of regional spirits spread more easily across the globe, the Whiskey Highball rose to prominence, an endlessly modifiable riff on a classic template. 6 Highballs to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE The secret to crafting an excellent Whiskey Highball is in the details. Whiskey quality is important, but not as key as making sure to use a whiskey you truly enjoy—if you wouldn’t prefer to sip it neat, don’t use it in this drink. You’ll also want to use high-quality ice to control both temperature and dilution, and freshly-opened club soda that has been chilled for as long as possible. The colder temperature helps slow the rate at which carbon dioxide molecules escape the water in which they are trapped, effectively dictating whether you feel the fizz on your tongue or if it leaves the glass first. Rules for creating a Whiskey Highball range from loose to exceedingly strict. Many Japanese bars, for example, have famously perfected their method down to the precise number of revolutions you should stir each glass. However, whiskey choice always remains a matter of preference. Bourbon, rye, wheated whiskey, scotch, or Japanese whisky will all work well. The cocktail is simply meant to enhance and lengthen the base spirit with as little alteration as possible, intended to be in service to the whiskey’s flavor, rather than diluting or masking it.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'soda water'}]","['Add the whiskey into a highball glass with ice.', 'Top with soda water and stir gently and briefly to combine.']",153,whiskey

In the case of the Japanese Sour, Shigefumi Kabashima uses Japanese whisky and incorporates yuzu and kuromitsu. Yuzu is a citrus fruit with a tart flavor that’s like a combination of lemon, lime and orange, and kuromitsu is a molasses-like syrup derived from kokutō, a mineral-rich unrefined sugar. “Nikka Coffey Grain whisky gives a rich and elegant flavor; ‘black honey’ also has rich sweetness, and the yuzu scent enhances these ingredients, giving the cocktail a Japanese flavor profile,” says Kabashima, the owner and beverage director of ROKC in New York City. Just like is common with the classic version, Kabashima mixes his ingredients together and then employs a dry-shake (shaking without ice before shaking again with ice) to incorporate the egg white with the liquids.

https://www.liquor.com/nine-pound-hammer-cocktail-recipe-5070393,High Seas,Liquor.com,"Vermouth is a cocktail workhorse that is used in everything from the Negroni to the Martini . It can be paired with spirits, combined with other low-ABV aperitifs or sipped straight. The fortified wine is incredibly versatile, but sometimes what one vermouth can’t do, two or more vermouths can. Mixing vermouth is nothing new, and it’s the premise for “perfect” cocktails, in which a drink’s vermouth component is split between sweet and dry, usually in equal parts. But there’s always room for experimentation, and that’s what we see with the High Seas, an original drink from Death & Co Denver head bartender Alex Jump. Her drink, which is a play on the classic Boulevardier (bourbon, Campari, sweet vermouth), calls for aonori-infused High West Silver Oat whiskey, Cappelletti, blanc vermouth, dry vermouth and Clear Creek pear eau-de-vie. Aonori is a green seaweed that has been dried and crushed into a powder. This adds a unique and savory quality to the unaged whiskey, and the infusion is easy to accomplish at home by simply adding 10 grams of the seaweed to a full bottle of whiskey and letting it sit for 15 minutes. Cappelletti is a wine-based Italian red bitter aperitif that plays the role of Campari in this cocktail, and the pear eau-de-vie lends a hint of fruit. But unlike the Boulevardier which uses sweet vermouth, Jump enlists blanc and dry. “The split between [these] vermouths keeps the cocktail perfectly balanced—not too sweet and not too dry,” she says, noting that using varying levels of sweetness in vermouth is a great way to control balance without introducing a different sugar source. “I apply [this] same logic when mixing Bamboos for myself at home, as I like a slightly drier cocktail generally, so I like to make them with a bit of both blanc and dry vermouth.” The result is a well-balanced cocktail that is reminiscent of the Boulevardier but with a lighter and more floral flavor profile that’s all its own.

https://www.liquor.com/cantarito-cocktail-recipe-6748011,Cantarito,Audrey Morgan,"If you love a good Paloma , you might just find a new favorite cocktail in the Cantarito, a similar drink that adds more citrus juices and a pinch of salt to the refreshing mix of tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda. The most distinguishing feature of the cocktail, however, is its namesake clay drinking vessel. A diminutive of the Spanish word for pitcher, cántaro, the cantarito is a small earthenware clay jug that originated in Jalisco, the Mexican state where tequila is produced. The cántaro was once used for gathering and storing water; the smaller version is now most often a vessel for tequila and other drinks, including pulque, aguas frescas, chicha, Micheladas , and, of course, its eponymous cocktail. Paloma 352 ratings Like the Paloma, the Cantarito drink has undefinable origins. In modern times, it is most commonly slung from roadside stands throughout Mexico, where variations abound. It is typically made with grapefruit, lime, and orange juices, but you might also find versions that use other juices. Many are rimmed with the chile-lime seasoning Tajín, while some add chamoy, a popular condiment made of fruit, dried chiles, and lime juice. The Cantarito Cup Regardless of the ingredients used, the cantarito cup itself insulates the drink, a major selling point in Jalisco’s subtropical heat. The idea of keeping a drink cold by harnessing clay’s temperature-retaining properties isn’t unique to Mexico. The cantarito, which is sometimes called a jarrito de barro, bears similarities to the copa de barro that is often used to chill and serve Cuba’s oldest known cocktail, the Canchánchara . The alkalinity of the clay also helps to neutralize the acids in the citrus juices, balancing the drink’s flavors. You can buy cantarito cups online in various sizes, although you can also make the cocktail in a Collins glass. If you are using a cantarito cup, soak the cup in cold water for 10 minutes before shaking up a drink to ensure it is ice-cold. The recipe below calls for reposado tequila , but you can use blanco tequila, if you prefer, for a crisper flavor profile; Jarritos and Squirt are common grapefruit soda brands that are easy to find stateside.

https://www.liquor.com/ranch-water-cocktail-recipe-5496343,Ranch Water,Audrey Morgan,"In a state where everything is supposedly bigger, the unofficial cocktail is surprisingly subdued: West Texas favorite Ranch Water is a simple mix of blanco tequila , lime juice, and Topo Chico sparkling water. Legends of its origins abound: One rumor alleges a 1960s wild-haired rancher invented the drink, which caused him to follow the stars all the way from Fort Davis to Marathon before falling asleep under a piñon tree. Another theory is more likely: The thirst-quenching concoction was a makeshift happy hour special of West Texas ranchers, who would take a swig of Topo Chico before adding a shot of tequila and squeeze of lime. Ranch 616 in Austin claims honors for the drink’s evocative name: According to late chef-owner Kevin Williamson, he put Ranch Water on the bar’s opening menu in 1998, and he was confident enough in his story that he even applied for a trademark. Williamson also told The Washington Post that he trained employees of the legendary Gage Hotel’s White Buffalo Bar, where the drink made its official menu debut in 2010. 20 Tequila and Mezcal Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE The once-niche Ranch Water has found mainstream success: National chain restaurants including On the Border and Buffalo Wild Wings have added versions of Ranch Water to their menus, and many companies have developed canned hard seltzer versions, including Dos Equis, Lone River, and even Topo Chico. It’s worth noting that many of these seltzers employ malt liquor rather than tequila. Thankfully, it’s easy to make the real thing on your own with the three-ingredient recipe below. Opt for your favorite blanco tequila ; if you want a sweeter drink, you can add a splash of orange liqueur such as Cointreau or Grand Marnier. If you don’t have Topo Chico on hand, you can certainly swap in another sparkling mineral water or even club soda—just don’t tell a Texan.

https://www.liquor.com/super-juice-margarita-cocktail-recipe-5270997,Super Juice Margarita,Liquor.com,"Margaritas , while delicious, aren’t necessarily sustainable cocktails in their most conventional form. The limes juiced to provide the drink’s sour component are typically tossed into the garbage immediately after being squeezed, leading to lots of waste destined for the landfill. One way around this problem is to maximize the juice you get out of your limes and use every part of the fruit, including the peel. Nickle Morris, a bartender and the owner of Expo in Louisville, Kentucky, has developed what he calls “Super Juice,” an ingredient that maximizes the amount of juice each lime can produce while also minimizing the amount that’s thrown away. First, he extracts the oils from the limes’ peels using an acid mixture, similar to the way sugar is used to make an oleo saccharum , and mixes the results with water. Then he juices the limes and adds the juice to the mixture. The process yields more than a liter of Super Juice with a mere 10 or so limes, essentially tripling the amount of juice produced versus what you’d get from juicing the same number of limes the conventional way. The recipe for the Margarita itself comes from bartender and cocktail developer and writer Tyler Zielinski, who considers Morris’s concoction to be “a game changer” for making cocktails.  “The Super Juice can be shaken like ordinary lime,” he says. “It’s such a brilliant ingredient.” Many Margaritas call for agave syrup as a sweetener, along with or instead of orange liqueur, and you can certainly feel free to use it in this one. In keeping with the drink’s sustainable ethos, however, you may wish to instead use honey syrup made with local honey so as to reduce the drink’s carbon footprint. And, of course, you should choose a tequila made employing best practices in terms of both social/cultural and environmental sustainability. Note that the quantities provided below for the Super Juice will make enough for a party’s worth of cocktails. If you’re not making drinks for a gathering, however, you may want to reduce the quantities given by half or more.

https://www.liquor.com/kol-zero-lime-margarita-cocktail-recipe-5270994,Kol Zero-Lime Margarita,Tyler Zielinski,"The Margarita is many drinkers’ favorite agave-spirit cocktail. But the limes used in the popular drink generate waste, especially when it’s made in cocktail-bar quantities. Many bars and restaurants have started heading away from using fresh citrus in their drinks because the fruits, once squeezed for their juice, get discarded and almost certainly head toward a landfill. So how do you get that fresh, tart flavor and, just as importantly, that hit of bright acid in a Margarita without using lime juice? Kol Mezcaleria in London has one answer. The bar takes an unorthodox approach to crafting its house Margarita by replacing the usual lime juice with yuzu sake and verjus. The yuzu sake adds a citrus-like element, while the verjus bolsters the drink’s acidity. A rim that’s equal parts sweet, salty, and acidic enhances the flavors within. The sustainability considerations don’t stop at the lime (or lack thereof), though. Matt Varona, the beverage manager at Kol, notes that the bar purchases its verjus in five-liter bag-in-boxes to be less wasteful with packaging as well. And it’s important to choose your spirit carefully: Using a mezcal that employs best practices in its distillation processes is also important. Many industry pros recommend Del Maguey Vida as a quality espadín made for mixing that also sticks to good sustainability standards. Note that unlike a conventionally made Margarita, this drink is stirred rather than shaken. That’s because as a rule, cocktails made without a citrus (or dairy) component don’t require the aeration that shaking provides.

https://www.liquor.com/division-bell-cocktail-recipe-5270691,Division Bell,Audrey Morgan,"The Division Bell, an agave-and-Aperol-fueled Last Word riff from veteran bartender Phil Ward, was among the first cocktails to put mezcal on the map in the U.S. When Ward opened the now-shuttered Mayahuel in New York City’s East Village with Ravi DeRossi in 2009, American consumers mostly associated agave spirits with Margaritas . But Ward had been experimenting with agave-spirit cocktails for some time at nearby Death & Co., where in 2007 he created the Oaxaca Old Fashioned , a twist that swapped out bourbon in favor of a split base of reposado tequila and mezcal. When it came time to open his own place, Ward decided to go all in on agave, putting 20 tequila and mezcal drinks on Mayahuel’s first menu, including the Division Bell. The name pays homage to the Pink Floyd album of the same name, which Ward says he listened to on repeat while he was constructing the bar. A few years earlier, a classic cocktail had re-entered the spotlight: The Last Word, an equal-parts drink of gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and freshly squeezed lime juice, was invented at the Detroit Athletic Club around 1915, but it was lost to history until Seattle bartender Murray Stenson unearthed the recipe in the early aughts. Soon, the pre-Prohibition classic was inspiring plenty of variations. One of the most famous was the Paper Plane , a twist by Sam Ross that employed equal parts bourbon, Aperol, Amaro Nonino Quintessia, and lemon juice. Ward’s Division Bell hewed more closely to the original, keeping the maraschino liqueur and lime juice but swapping out gin for mezcal and green Chartreuse for Aperol. At Death & Co., meanwhile, Joaquín Simó created the Naked & Famous , an equal-parts cocktail of mezcal, Aperol, yellow Chartreuse, and lime juice. Although the two are similar on paper, each borrows from its parent drink in a different way. While the Naked & Famous uses the Aperol in place of the original’s maraschino liqueur, the Division Bell employs the orange bitter liqueur in place of herbaceous Chartreuse, giving each drink its own distinct flavor profile. Ward’s cocktail calls for Del Maguey Vida mezcal, the brand’s flagship expression and a bartender favorite for its mixability, but any espadín with fruity and smoky notes will work. Aperol lends its bitter, citrusy flavors alongside the brightness of lime juice and the gentle sweetness of maraschino liqueur. It may not have the easy-to-remember equal-parts formula of the drink that inspired it, but this modern classic is worth committing to memory.

https://www.liquor.com/mexican-firing-squad-cocktail-recipe-5270686,Mexican Firing Squad,Liquor.com,"If Margaritas and Palomas dominate your cocktail repertoire in the warmer months, consider shaking up a lesser-known tequila classic. Made with lime juice, grenadine, and bitters, the Mexican Firing Squad is just as refreshing as other standbys of the spirit. The recipe was first recorded by historian Charles H. Baker in his 1939 guide Gentleman’s Companion , which also introduced American audiences to the rye-based Remember the Maine . Baker was not a bartender by trade. In fact, he was a former merchant who traveled around the globe seeking out new experiences and drinks, which he documented in his book. One such adventure brought him to La Cucaracha Cocktail Club in Mexico City, where he happened upon the Mexican Firing Squad two years before the book’s publication. As Baker writes, he and his companion ditched their chaperones, “2 young Mexican caballeros whose parents mattered in official circles in Mexico. “We were herded into fancy, rather dull places, served too warm drinks,” Baker continues. “And finally on 1 occasion we broke off by ourself, sought out this bar—where an aristocrat native oughtn’t to be seen!—ordered things in our own way.” Despite Baker’s description and the bar’s name, which translates to “the cockroach,” La Cucaracha was anything but a seedy dive: The cocktail bar was an emblem of Prohibition-era swankiness, with a menu of 40 classics that featured an illustration of a cigar-smoking insect in a tuxedo and tophat. In any case, Baker and his companion “almost became wrecked upon” the tequila concoction. Baker’s version called for two pours of tequila, the juice of two small limes, one and a half to two teaspoons of grenadine or plain gomme syrup, and two dashes of Angostura bitters. The contemporary version of the cocktail, calling for a bit more grenadine, produces a sweeter drink. You’ll want to start with blanco tequila, the most agave-forward expression of the spirit, which blends seamlessly into citrusy cocktails. Lime juice brightens and grenadine slightly sweetens the mix with its tart, fruity notes. Opt for a high-quality bottle of the sweetener or make your own version of the pomegranate syrup. A hefty few dashes of Angostura bitters add depth and warm baking-spice notes to the drink. Some modern-day iterations of the cocktail  call for it to be topped with club soda, but the classic is plenty refreshing without it—a fine replacement for your usual Margarita. 20 Tequila and Mezcal Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",68,tequila

Among the most noteworthy of those is the Naked & Famous, created by Joaquín Simó, most recently a partner in New York City’s now-closed Pouring Ribbons, during his time at Death & Co. “That cocktail has really ended up being my most popular creation, which I wouldn't have expected when I created it a decade ago,” says Simó. Echoing an oft-quoted statement about his drink’s inspirations, Simó says, “The Naked & Famous is indeed the bastard love child borne out of an illicit Oaxacan love affair between a classic Last Word and Sam Ross' Paper Plane cocktail.” Paper Plane 643 ratings It shares its equal-parts formula with both drinks, and an ingredient—lime juice and Aperol, respectively—with each. However, the Naked & Famous swaps the Last Word’s Green Chartreuse for the gentler, sweeter Yellow Chartreuse , and opts for an unexpected base spirit: mezcal. “Choosing a big, aggressively smoky and funky mezcal was key here, as there is relatively little of it in the drink and it needs to stand up against two liqueurs, neither of which lacks complexity,” says Simó. “If you want to say ‘Pour cost be damned!’ and make it according to the original recipe (which is what we do at Pouring Ribbons), the mezcal to reach for is Del Maguey's Chichicapa bottling.” The drink’s other components were chosen to complement that particular mezcal. “Rather than go huge with Campari and green Chartreuse, I chose their younger, lower-proof and -intensity siblings as modifiers to ensure that the complex notes of Chichicapa would not be drowned out while retaining the equal proportions of the original recipe,” says Simó. Over the decade since it was created, the cocktail has come to be considered a true modern classic. “I attribute its popularity to the balance and depth found in the drink,” says Simó. “The fruity notes of Aperol and honeyed herbaceousness of yellow Chartreuse don't result in a cloying one-note drink, but rather harmonize beautifully to create a refreshing, citrusy drink that changes in flavors from attack through mid-palate and into a long finish.”","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal (preferably Del Maguey Chichicapa)'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'yellow Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.']",73,mezcal

These days, a growing number of bartenders are embracing the vegetable for an additional merit, approaching it with an eye to reducing waste, using not just the kernels but also the cobs, husks, and more in innovative ways, seeking to maximize how they use the versatile ears. You might call it the vegetable equivalent of a nose-to-tail approach. Leanne Favre, the head bartender at Leyenda in Brooklyn, working with Shannon Ponche (who is no longer with Leyenda), developed a “Champagne corn cob syrup,” employing leftover corn cobs and sparkling wine that’s gone flat to make a flavorful syrup. “The corn cob element came from thinking about things in [Leyenda’s] kitchen that might not have been used,” says Favre. While boiling corn cobs releases an appealing sweet flavor, Favre says it’s also about the texture it provides. “Corn starch released from the cob provides a silky texture I almost relate more to honey,” she says.

https://www.liquor.com/jalapeno-diablo-cocktail-recipe-5220392,Jalapeño Diablo,Kate Dingwall,"“Spicy” can mean different things to a bartender: Is the adjective referring to the heat of chile peppers or the warming herbal notes of ginger? In this case, the answer is both. Nicholas Bennett, the bar director at Porchlight in New York City, calls on ginger to add additional spice to his riff on an El Diablo , the Jalapeño Diablo. Key to Bennett's variation is a jalapeño-infused tequila, which Bennett allows to infuse for about 10 minutes. You can opt to increase or decrease the infusing time depending on your preferred level of heat. In fact, the Porchlight team will taste every two minutes until the spirit reaches the exact level of heat they desire, according to Bennett. Like the classic, the Jalapeño Diablo also employs freshly squeezed lime juice, as well as ginger. But Bennett eschews the traditional ginger beer in favor of a rich ginger syrup, adding warming notes that play off the jalapeño’s heat. “Ginger is such a great ingredient for adding layers of spice to the drink while balancing out the flavors,” he says. A float of crème de cassis, a French black currant liqueur and the star of a Kir Royale , helps tone down the spiciness while adding tart, fruity flavor and giving the cocktail its gorgeous two-toned appearance. And a splash of club soda lends the drink a refreshing effervescence. The result of Bennett’s efforts is double the spice, and tenfold the flavor.

Agustin, who now runs Seattle’s Mountaineering Club , based the Smoke Follows Beauty on the Poquito Picante, a cocktail invented by Artemio Vasquez at his old stomping grounds. Both drinks rely on a base of muddled cucumber and cilantro and both pack the heat. While the original Poquito leaned on lemon juice, simple syrup, and gin, Agustin’s version takes cues from the ubiquitous Spicy Margarita, employing lime juice and doubling up on agave with mezcal and agave syrup. The New Rules for Creating Spicy Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE One key variation is Agustin’s use of serrano peppers, which can be up to five times hotter than jalapeños, which are often used in the Spicy Marg. But serranos don’t necessarily make for a throat-scorching drink. Instead of muddling the peppers or infusing the base spirit, Agustin opts to infuse triple sec. The liqueur’s sugars encapsulate the capsaicin in the peppers, he says, tempering the heat. You can make the triple sec to your tastes—while Agustin’s sweet heat spot involves infusing the peppers for 90 minutes, yours might be different. You can also steep separate batches at varying lengths of time to tailor the ingredient for more heat-sensitive guests. The drink also has plenty of cooling elements to balance the spiciness, including muddled cucumber and cilantro. And a chilled jicama slice seasoned with sal de gusano, or worm salt, serves as Agustin’s “get-out-of-jail free” card—a bite will help cool any residual burn.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'slices', 'ingredient': 'cucumber'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'stalks', 'ingredient': 'cilantro'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Ilegal mezcal joven'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'serrano-infused triple sec (recipe below)'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: jicama slice, chilled and seasoned with sal de gusano', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the cucumber and cilantro.', 'Add the mezcal, infused triple sec, lime juice, agave syrup, and ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a chilled slice of jicama seasoned with sal de gusano.']",20,mezcal

The Chrysanthemum, however, flips the script and gives dry vermouth the lead with Benedictine and absinthe taking a backseat. This century-old classic was included in Harry Craddock’s famous tome, “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” which helped to popularize it among bartenders and consumers when the book was published in 1930. But the Chrysanthemum is believed to have first appeared in “ Recipes for Mixed Drinks ” by Hugo R. Ensslin, which hit the market in 1916. Craddock’s recipe calls for dry vermouth and Benedictine in a two-to-one ratio—the formula still preferred today—while Ensslin’s recipe suggested equal parts. Benedictine is a French liqueur made from a secret blend of 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon and juniper, and has a sweet, herbal profile. Try both recipes to see which you prefer, but know that Benedictine’s flavor can take over a cocktail in a hurry, hence the preferred recipe doubling the vermouth.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rob-roy/,Rob Roy,Liquor.com,"The Rob Roy is a 19th-century cocktail consisting of scotch whisky, sweet vermouth, and bitters. It's notably similar to the beloved Manhattan , except the Rob Roy calls for scotch instead of American whiskey. The swap from bourbon (or rye) to scotch may not seem significant, but creates a completely different drink. The History of the Rob Roy While the Manhattan dates to around 1880, it’s believed that the Rob Roy first appeared more than a decade later, likely around 1894 at the Waldorf Astoria’s original location on Fifth Avenue. According to Frank Caiafa, NYC bartender and author of The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book , the drink was inspired by an operetta named Rob Roy , which was performed at the nearby Herald Square Theatre. Created by the composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist Harry B. Smith, the operetta was loosely based on a Scottish folk hero who was a Robin Hood-like figure named Rob Roy MacGregor. While there are some published examples of odd early 20th-century cocktails that called themselves a Rob Roy but share little resemblance to the recipe we know today, the original drink most likely predates the name itself. Prior to the name gaining traction, the drink was often simply referred to as a Manhattan, but one in which Scotch whisky was specified as the spirit of choice. How to Make a Manhattan RELATED ARTICLE How to Make a Rob Roy Like any good spirit-forward cocktail, the Rob Roy is an opportunity to highlight what’s in the glass, not hide it. Any number of scotches can yield a great drink, so choose your favorite. But note that you want a bottle that will pair with the herbal, bittersweet vermouth. Blended scotch is the usual choice. Single malts can certainly work, but anything too heavily peated may overpower the vermouth and lead to an unbalanced drink. The ratio of components varies, with many older recipes calling for equal parts scotch and vermouth and many newer recipes opting for a two-to-one build. This recipe puts emphasis on the whisky, letting it rise to the front so none of its nuance is lost. Mix a Rob Roy with different scotches and vermouths, and find the recipe you like best. Stirred with ice and served in a stemmed glass with a brandied cherry, the cocktail is flavorful, rich and warming. It’s a drink that demands contemplation, so find a comfortable perch and savor it slowly.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/el-presidente/,El Presidente,Liquor.com,"The El Presidente cocktail hails from Cuba and was created in the early 1900s. It was likely named for President Mario García Menocal, who ran the country from 1913 to 1921. During that time, Cuba was a popular vacation spot for U.S. citizens, and that popularity only grew after Prohibition was enacted, when thirsty yankees flocked to Havana for good weather and also good cocktails. Among those cocktails: the Mojito and Daiquiri , which are two of the island nation’s most famous contributions to drinking. But don’t overlook the El Presidente, a classic in its own right that is made with white rum, orange curaçao, French dry vermouth and grenadine. After the 13-year dry spell of Prohibition, American drinkers brought the El Presidente back home, but like many classics, it all but died out during the middle of the century. It was eventually revived in the aughts by curious bartenders, historians and authors who regularly looked to the past for liquid inspiration. This recipe comes from acclaimed bartender and spirits pro Simon Ford. It yields a tasty, well-balanced cocktail, but the El Presidente has changed through the years, with many bartenders and drinkers tweaking the formula. If you want more body, try a more richly flavored white rum or a lightly aged rum. If you want to lighten the vermouth, try a blanc style, which is semi-dry, slightly sweet and arguably the style of vermouth used in the original. And if you find the cocktail too orange-heavy, dial down the curaçao. You’ve got options, so tinker around until you make your own perfect El Presidente. 6 Cuban Cocktails for Drinking Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'white rum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange curaçao'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}]","['Add the white rum, dry vermouth, orange curaçao and grenadine to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.']",94,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/drunk-uncle/,Drunk Uncle,Liquor.com,"The Negroni is an Italian classic and the wonder child of modern cocktail bartending, in large part because of its endless opportunity for variations and riffs. In fact, some consider the Negroni to be, essentially, a family of cocktails: a base spirit, an amaro or other bitter liqueur and a vermouth, each in equal (or close to equal) parts. Some variations are established enough to have their own name, like the rye or bourbon-based Boulevardier or the Negroni Sbagliato, made with prosecco rather than gin. And although the liquor swap in a scotch Negroni is a simple one, it’s very much its own drink and has a dedicated fan base amongst bartenders. “To a degree, all Negronis are chasing the same flavor profile: strong, balanced, bitter, with a sweetness from the vermouth. But each one is a specialty in its own right,” says Shawn Soole, a bartender and consultant based in Victoria, B.C. His take on the scotch Negroni is the Drunk Uncle, and it relies on whisky from Islay, that famed island off the southwestern coast of Scotland renowned for its peat-forward whiskies. Unlike the Boulevardier or the popular Mezcal Negroni, Soole’s Drunk Uncle doesn’t use the Negroni’s signature bitter liqueur, Campari . Nor does it call for the usual sweet vermouth. Instead, Soole uses Cynar, a bittersweet, artichoke-based amaro, and bianco vermouth from Martini & Rossi. “Every cocktail depends on the brands you use. A light, balanced, smoky Islay whisky works well with Cynar amaro and bianco vermouth but doesn’t play well with Aperol or Campari,” says Soole. “Something will be off-balance.” In balancing the drink, he also uses a two-to-one-to-one ratio, rather than the usual equal parts that a Negroni calls for. The final twist is that of grapefruit, rather than orange. The end result is rich, smoky and bitter, and manages to have its own identity while unmistakably being a Negroni.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/martinez/,Martinez,Kevin Gray,"The cocktail world owes a lot to the classic Martinez. Made with equal parts gin and sweet vermouth, plus maraschino liqueur and bitters, this old-school variation of the Manhattan is often said to have inspired early iterations of the Martini we know today. The origins of the Martinez are unclear. It’s possible that legendary bartender and author Jerry Thomas may have invented the cocktail for a customer traveling to the port city of Martinez, California. The city of Martinez, however, insists that a local bartender concocted the drink. It’s a mystery best pondered over a good cocktail. What’s mostly certain is that the Martinez made its first print appearance in the 1884 book, The Modern Bartenders' Guide by O.H. Byron. But it’s likely that the cocktail predated the book by a decade or more. Byron’s recipe didn’t specify which type of gin should be used, but given the preference and availability of Dutch genever at the time, it’s reasonable to conclude that this malty style of gin featured in the cocktail. (English gin had not yet assumed its throne in America.) The Martinez appeared again in 1887, when it was included in the posthumously published edition of The Bar-Tender’s Guide by Thomas. In this version, the recipe specifically called for Old Tom gin, a spirit that lands somewhere between malt-heavy genever and juniper-heavy London dry gin. Over the years, other Martinez recipes called for dry vermouth instead of sweet, or the addition of curaçao, but Thomas’ recipe most resembles the Martinez served today. Experiment with different styles of gin to tweak this recipe to suit your palate. London dry gin will produce a more bracing drink, while modern styles can create a more pronounced citrusy or floral flavor, depending on the bottle. If you want to hew as closely as possible to the traditional recipe, make your drink with Old Tom gin. When stirred with ice, the cocktail’s ingredients blend into a rich package laced with soft juniper, herbal vermouth, and the dry cherry notes of maraschino liqueur. The Martinez is part Manhattan , part Martini, and entirely delicious.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/corpse-reviver-no-1/,Corpse Reviver No. 1,Liquor.com,"The Corpse Reviver was a family of cocktails traditionally consumed as a hair-of-the-dog, a hangover reliever to refresh and enliven after a night of heavy drinking. However, the category was a loose one, with no real shared characteristics save that they tended to be relatively high-proof and served up, rather than over ice. The Corpse Reviver No. 1’s first recorded recipe was in “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” originally published in 1930. The recipe book was a collection of the Savoy Hotel London’s most popular drinks. In it, bartender and author Harry Cradock writes of the Corpse Reviver No. 1, “To be taken before 11 a.m., or whenever steam and energy are needed.” Of course, alcohol is not a stimulant like caffeine, and it is generally ill-advised to be drinking before noon, especially in pursuit of “energy.” Though popular during the late 19th and early 20th century, Corpse Revivers generally faded away after Prohibition. But like other many other pre-Prohibition drinks, they’ve seen a revival in recent years. Walk into a bar today and scan the drink menu, and you’re more likely to find a Corpse Reviver No. 2 , or a variation on the No. 2, than any of its fellows. Still, the No. 1 does appear from time to time. Unlike its more popular sibling — a bright and botanical gin drink misted with absinthe — the Corpse Reviver No. 1 is a rich and vibrant mixture with a brandy base. It is, yes, an odd choice for what is historically served as a morning drink, but it is a lush and lovely evening tipple, leaning towards the Manhattan family with its dark spirits and vermouth. The richness largely comes from the split-based brandy, as the drink is equal parts cognac and Calvados, an apple brandy from Normandy, France. The richness of the brandies calls for a drier, more botanical-forward sweet vermouth, something like Punt E Mes or Carpano Antica Formula. Sweeter vermouths can potentially turn the drink cloying. For those who cannot find a bottle of Calvados, or who want to take a detour, it’s acceptable to use another type of apple brandy , though the flavor profile will not be identical. Similarly, a Spanish brandy or other fine brandy can replace the cognac, but again, there will be differences. Try playing around with different kinds of brandies until you find one that is the most revivifying for your Corpse Reviver No. 1.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Calvados'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cognac'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}]","['Add the Calvados, cognac and sweet vermouth into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.']",52,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/adonis/,Adonis,Liquor.com,"Not every cocktail needs to be a laborious affair, made with multiple spirits and homemade ingredients. Neither do they always need to be spirit-forward libations packing an alcoholic punch. Sometimes it’s nice to have an easy-drinking, two-ingredient , low-alcohol sipper like the Adonis cocktail. This pleasing drink is made with only sweet vermouth and fino sherry, but it is a nuanced and layered concoction all the same. First crafted sometime in the mid-1880s, the Adonis was made, like many classic drinks, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Its invention was in honor of a Broadway musical of the same name: Adonis was the first show to make it to 500 performances, which at the time made it the longest running Broadway musical. The namesake cocktail is lovely, like the titular character, and is the perfect kind of drink to enjoy before attending a musical or other play, as its low-proof nature means you won’t be too cloudy to enjoy the show. 10 Easy Two-Ingredient Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE Really, the Adonis is a chance to sample your favorite fino sherry and sweet vermouth—and to find which two mix together the best. These days, there is a bounty of new and old vermouths on the market, from closely guarded historic recipes to hip new styles made across the world. Sherry is still relatively constrained to Spanish winemakers, but there is variety there, as well. Fino is a very dry, very light style of the fortified wine. Swapping it for a manzanilla sherry can also work, as the two styles are similar. The Adonis is sometimes made with a few dashes of orange bitters, so feel free to add those if the drink needs more depth. Keeping the bitters and swapping the sweet vermouth for dry brings it very close to being a Bamboo cocktail, another low-proof, equal parts libation from the late 19th century.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bobby-burns/,Bobby Burns,Liquor.com,"Though not as renowned as drinks like the Manhattan, Sidecar or Martini, the Bobby Burns is a classic cocktail dating back to the early part of the 20th century. Similar to the Rusty Nail or Blood & Sand , it has the rare quality of being made with blended Scotch whisky rather than bourbon, rye or another spirit all together. Like many storied cocktails, the origins of the Bobby Burns are fuzzy. The first available source for it dates to 1902’s bar book “Bishop & Babcock Company’s Fancy Drinks,” though in the book the recipe is referred to as the Baby Burns, and calls for one teaspoon each of vermouth and Benedictine, as well as a pony (generally considered one ounce) of scotch. Later, in texts like “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” in 1917 and 1930’s seminal “Savoy Cocktail Book” from Harry Craddock, the name was changed to the Bobby Burns; while there is always going to be some debate as to the meaning of the name, it’s likely an homage to the famed Robert Burns, widely considered the national poet of Scotland. Benedictine: What It Is and How to Use It RELATED ARTICLE The cocktail itself is similar to a Rob Roy (named for another famous Scot), the scotch-based Manhattan variation. However, this drink (usually) sees equal parts scotch and sweet vermouth, rather than two-to-one proportions, and substitutes the traditional dashes of bitters for a half ounce of Benedictine. This herbal liqueur, like Green Chartreuse, is made with a proprietary recipe known only by a handful of people. What is known is that there are 27 herbs and spices in its blend, and the Benedictine is an essential part of the Bobby Burns. While single malt scotches tend to get the most attention, blended scotches are more commonly used in mixed drinks. And though earlier recipes didn’t specify, modern takes on the Bobby Burns tend to follow this style. There are plenty of quality blended Scotch whiskies on the market, from the more famous labels like Johnny Walker, Chivas Regal and Famous Grouse to lesser known and newer expressions. Whichever bottle you use, go with a 12-year-old, which lends more smoothness, richness and complexity. Similarly, the choice of sweet vermouth is up to you, but it’s recommended to go with something on the dryer, more botanical side like Noilly Prat or Punt E Mes. A bit of lemon zest, its oils expressed over the surface of the drink, finishes the Bobby Burns, and the drink is best served with a few Scottish shortbread biscuits and a collection of the poet’s works.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/high-on-the-hog/,High on the Hog,Céline Bossart,"According to everyone who’s experienced it, bourbon and bacon make quite possibly one of the best combinations on earth. This easy-to-make adult slushie from Jerry Nevins’ Sloshies: 102 Boozy Cocktails Straight from the Freezer is no exception, bringing dry vermouth, ginger ale, and maple into the mix for good measure. To incorporate the maple flavor into this drink, Nevins uses Cabin Fever’s maple whiskey, but don’t panic if you can’t find this product in your area—you can always make your own, as long as you’ve got access to a good, solid whiskey at around 40% alcohol, along with some high-quality maple syrup (preferably from Canada). Celebrity chef and die-hard Canadian Hugh Acheson offers some insight on using maple syrup in the kitchen (or wherever you keep your bar): “Pure maple syrup from Canada is the superior maple syrup because Quebec is the only place in the world with an independent organization that has developed a strict grading and inspection system that determines the quality of their maple syrup,” he shares. “As a Canadian, I know how special this system is; it’s what allows Quebec to produce 72% of the world’s maple syrup supply and creates the unmatched flavor of pure maple syrup that elevates any dish [or drink].” While Cabin Fever uses Grade B maple syrup in their recipe, thanks to its dialed-back sweetness, you can use whichever grade you can get your hands on—just be sure to modify your recipe accordingly. In order to make your own maple whiskey at home, all you’ll need is your whiskey of choice (again, this should be around 40% alcohol) and your top-quality maple syrup. A general benchmark to keep in mind is eight ounces of maple per standard 750-milliliter bottle at the very most, and be sure to start small and increase the maple to taste—as many bartenders will tell you, it's easier to add more to a drink than it is to remove (which, with liquids, is pretty near impossible). If you’re planning on infusing, say, a half-bottle’s worth of whiskey, try adding one ounce of maple syrup and tasting, then increase from there until you’ve reached your desired flavor profile. Like Cabin Fever’s approach, try to err on the side of less sweet as this particular cocktail incorporates other sources of sugar, like ginger ale.

The Polar Bear calls for mezcal , blanc vermouth, creme de menthe and a homemade angelica tincture—or, if you want to simplify the last step, store-bought celery bitters. Trick Dog uses La Puritita Verdá mezcal, which is distilled from Espadin agave in the Oaxacan mountains. It’s savory and mildly smoky, with earthy undertones. The mezcal pairs deftly with blanc vermouth, a light and floral vermouth that is sweeter than dry vermouth, while often containing hints of honey, fruit and spice. Understanding the Main Types of Vermouth RELATED ARTICLE The creme de menthe comes from Tempus Fugit, a company known for recreating classic and sometimes forgotten liqueurs. In this case, they created a true representation of an old-school creme de menthe, made by macerating and then distilling peppermint and botanicals. The 56-proof bottle is fresh and minty, with herbal complexity and a kick of cane-sugar sweetness. To keep the cocktail clear, be sure to choose white creme de menthe, not green, as the latter will muddy your drink with a green-hue. And no one’s ever seen a green polar bear. The angelica tincture is very easy to make at home by mixing dried angelica root (find this online or in a spice shop) with Everclear, a highly-potent grain alcohol that works well as a flavor extractor. If you don’t want to take this extra step, no problem—you can sub out the angelica tincture for celery bitters. The Polar Bear is a fun take on the classic Stinger , a pre-Prohibition cocktail composed of cognac and white creme de menthe. In later years, the Stinger underwent some experimentation, in which the cognac was swapped for other base spirits, like gin. Consider this drink a Mezcal Stinger, but with a couple Trick Dog flourishes.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'La Puritita Verdá\xa0mezcal'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dolin blanc\xa0vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Tempus Fugit\xa0creme de menthe'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'angelica tincture (recipe below)'}]","['Add the mezcal, blanc vermouth, creme de menthe and angelica tincture (or celery bitters) to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.']",148,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tequila-manhattan/,Tequila Manhattan (Distrito Federal),Liquor.com,"The Manhattan , featuring American whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters, was invented in New York around 1880. It quickly became one of the most popular cocktails in the country, eventually making its way around the world. Over the decades, creative bartenders have found countless ways to riff on the classic, experimenting with different spirits and fortified wines to create new versions that pay homage to the original. The Distrito Federal, also known as the Tequila Manhattan, is one such drink. Named for the former moniker of Mexico City, the cocktail is an aged-tequila twist on the classic that combines reposado tequila with sweet vermouth and orange bitters. The Differences Between Blanco, Reposado, and Añejo Tequila RELATED ARTICLE Reposado tequila is aged for at least two months and up to one year, most often in oak barrels that once held American whiskey, lending notes of vanilla, caramel, and baking spices to the spirit. It’s no surprise, then, that it shines in a traditionally whiskey-based drink. Stir the ingredients with ice, and add a lime twist garnish to complement the tequila. It’s an easy cocktail to make at home the next time you want a Manhattan—but not the same Manhattan you’ve been drinking for years.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'reposado tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cocktail cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lime twist and a cherry (optional).']",35,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/preakness/,Preakness,Liquor.com,"When it comes to drinks related to horse races, there is one clear standout: The Mint Julep , the famed signature drink of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. And while the Kentucky Derby is arguably the most famous of horse races in the United States, there are others. One such race is Preakness Stakes, held annually on the third Saturday in May at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. It’s that race that gives the name to Preakness, a variation on the classic Manhattan . The drink comes from Allen Katz , a bartender, spirits expert and founder of the New York Distilling Company. He was also the host of “The Cocktail Hour” for Martha Stewart Living Radio on SiriusXM. In his drink, Katz makes only one minor tweak to the original Manhattan recipe, but it adds a considerable amount of nuance: He adds a splash of Benedictine . The French liqueur Benedictine is in that family of spirits where the ancient recipe—reportedly developed in 1510 by the Benedictine monk Don Bernardo Vincelli—is only known by a handful. Like that of Chartreuse , the recipe is a tightly kept secret consisting of dozens of botanicals, including angelica, hyssop and lemon balm. In bartending, the spirit is primarily known for its role in the famed Vieux Carré from New Orleans. However, it also serves well in this Manhattan, adding additional complexity and botanical depth. Katz is less specific about the other two major ingredients in the Preakness, though he does call for an American rye whiskey rather than a bourbon. Rye’s signature spice is welcome in Manhattans generally, helping to cut through some of the vermouth sweetness. As with any drink, though, it is up to taste preferences, and no one will fault you for substituting your favorite bourbon. Similarly, the sweet vermouth is up to personal choice, but a higher quality vermouth will generally make a higher quality cocktail, admittedly with higher price tag. One final, minor twist to the drink is in the choice of garnish: normally a Manhattan calls for the signature cherry, though some drinkers might prefer a thin slice of orange peel for the extra oils and aromatics. The Preakness calls for neither, but rather a lemon peel, whose oils will help brighten the drink’s dark, lush profile.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'American rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the whiskey, sweet vermouth, Benedictine and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass or coupe.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",26,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bloody-kirby/,Bloody Kirby,Liquor.com,"As far as brunch drinks are concerned, there really is no competition for the crown jewel. Only one drink can truly compete as the hangover cure-all, the brunch standby, the consummate morning concoction. We are, of course, talking about the Bloody Mary and its plethora of variations . Spicy or mild, with an elaborate and meaty garnish or served with a single celery stick, there’s no wrong way to build your morning Bloody Mary. However, sometimes it can be a lot of work, both to make the drink and to finish an entire one, especially when it’s a full pint of spicy tomato juice and vodka. The Bloody Kirby offers a sleek, minimalist take on the classic Bloody Mary, bringing a bit of a Martini element while maintaining the core essence of the iconic brunch libation. The drink comes from New York City bartending veteran and writer Nick Mautone. At its base is Grey Goose Le Citron vodka, a high end French vodka infused with citrus oils. While you can substitute other citrus vodkas, be sure to select ones that aren’t artificially flavored to maintain the quality of the drink. A splash of dry vermouth adds a silky mouthfeel and some herbaceous aromatics, especially after it’s muddled with Kirby cucumber slices and a single dash of Tabasco for a bit of heat. If you’re the type to make your Bloody Marys with a good glug of hot sauce, hold off until you’ve tasted the Bloody Kirby as intended: its smaller size means a little spice goes a long way. Of course, it wouldn’t be a relative of the Mary if it didn’t have tomato juice, but rather than the generous pour it normally gets, the recipe only calls for one and a half ounces. Feel free to use whatever tomato juice you normally would for your drink of choice, but try and avoid ones with an abundance of added sugar. No one would mistake the Bloody Kirby for the Bloody Mary if served one: rather than a pint or pilsner glass, this is served over a large ice cube in an Old Fashioned glass. Similarly, it doesn’t receive the usual plethora of garnishes—simplicity remains the key, as a cucumber spear or two is all that’s needed. Of course, no one will judge too hard if you throw in a bacon strip or some pickled vegetables. 12 Bloody Mary Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE",[],"['In a shaker, muddle the cucumber slices with the vodka, vermouth and Tabasco.', 'Add ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the tomato juice and stir gently to combine.', 'Garnish with a Kirby cucumber spear']",5,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/nick-nora-dry-martini/,Nick & Nora Martini,Kevin Gray,"The Nick & Nora Martini is named for characters in “The Thin Man,” a novel by Dashiell Hammett. The tale was originally published in Redbook magazine in 1933 and then published in book form the following year and subsequently made into a popular series of movies. The release came as Prohibition was ending and wasted no time celebrating cocktail culture. Nick and Nora Charles are a quick-witted couple: Nick a retired detective, and Nora his wife. Together they solve crimes and make drinks, including Martinis, Manhattans and Highballs, all accompanied by effortless banter. The Nick & Nora Martini is similar to the traditional Martini (gin, dry vermouth, orange bitters) but modeled after what the characters drank in the book. Although the exact spirits can be tweaked to your preference, bartending legend Dale DeGroff provides this recipe. He suggests using Beefeater, a classic London dry gin, and Noilly Prat, a good dry vermouth from France. That combination in a three-to-one ratio, with an olive for garnish, will help you channel the intrepid duo as you stir then sip your cocktail. One noteworthy aside: In “The Thin Man,” Nick and Nora shake their Martinis. Nick even instructs a bartender that, “The important thing is the rhythm. Always have rhythm in your shaking. Now a Manhattan you shake to fox-trot time, a Bronx to two-step time, a Dry Martini you always shake to waltz time.” That certainly provides good reading, but DeGroff follows the preferred path for cocktails composed entirely of spirits, opting to stir the drink, which produces a clear, silky cocktail free of ice shards. In addition to their eponymous cocktail, Nick and Nora’s enduring impact on cocktail culture also inspired the proliferation of the Nick & Nora glass, a stemmed, slightly rounded cocktail glass that lands somewhere between a traditional Martini glass and a coupe. In the movie, the duo drank regularly from this modestly sized glass (which is good, because on one occasion they each downed six Martinis), which helped to popularize it at bars and among the public. You will still find the glass in use today, particularly at your better cocktail bars. Its attractive shape and reasonable volume provide a great vessel for craft drinks. 6 Things You Should Know About the Martini RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Spanish olive', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin and vermouth to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a small Spanish olive without pimento filling.']",32,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mckinleys-delight/,McKinley’s Delight,David Wondrich,"It’s never an easy job, even in the best of times: impossibly long hours, incessant wrangling with self-important blowhards, crackpots to the right of you and loonies to the left and everybody in the whole world second-guessing every little thing you do. In the worst of times, it’s all that, plus a war to win. Small wonder that a great many of our presidents have liked a good, stiff drink every once in awhile. George Washington favored his wife’s Rum Punch, while JFK preferred his rum in Daiquiri form. FDR mixed a mean—and by “mean,” I mean “terrible”— Martini . Richard Nixon, when he wasn’t having scotch (he kept a bottle in his desk), was another Martini man. In that, at least, he stands beside Barack Obama, though Obama prefers vodka in his. Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson were bourbon drinkers, as was Ulysses S. Grant, famously; Martin Van Buren was another whiskey fan—indeed, one of his nicknames was “Blue Whiskey Van”—while the candidate he lost the presidency to, William Henry Harrison, adopted hard cider as his campaign tipple, to seem like a man of the people. James Buchanan and Warren Harding drank whiskey, too (and pretty much everything else). Even Teddy Roosevelt, who lost a brother to alcoholism, allowed himself the occasional Mint Julep when suffering through a Washington summer. Presidents have not only enjoyed cocktails, but also inspired them, although none as well as Mario García Menocal, president of Cuba from 1913 to 1921, who was immortalized by the utterly sublime El Presidente . That one still remains popular today. Alas, most of the concoctions dedicated to American presidents were neither popular nor sublime. Take, for example, the Nixon Cocktail, invented by Joe Gilmore of the American Bar at the Savoy Hotel in London to commemorate Tricky Dick’s 1969 visit, a potent but rather unconvincing mix of equal parts bourbon and sloe gin dashed with peach bitters and served on the rocks with a slice of peach. (That’s still better than the “Nixon Cocktail” an anonymous wag was touting in 1973, post-Watergate: “water with a bug in it.”) The Baltimore politico who concocted a McKinley Punch in 1896 took the opposite tack from Gilmore, venturing into impotence by merely combining sweetened orange juice with red wine. Yet 1896 also saw one of the finest presidential cocktails, created at the bar in the old Waldorf-Astoria in New York, one of the very best watering holes in the country and a GOP stronghold. The McKinley’s Delight succeeds because it’s basically the same old stuff that everybody likes, just dressed up a little to make it seem new. There’s a lesson there, I suppose. 5 Cocktails to Make for Presidents’ Day RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'cherry liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, cherry liqueur and absinthe to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Stir, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Twist a thin swath of lemon peel over the drink and discard.']",11,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/django-reinhardt/,Django Reinhardt,Liquor.com,"Day-drinking is a time-honored tradition, whether it’s a weekend brunch, casual business lunch or during a vacation. However, with midday imbibing there’s always a risk of a sleepy, fuzzy afternoon. For those who want to skip the perils of the Martini lunch while still enjoying an adult beverage during the day, food and travel writer Kat Odell has the answers in her book “Day Drinking: 50 Cocktails for a Mellow Buzz.” One recipe in the book is the Django Reinhardt, which comes from Erick Castro of San Diego’s Polite Provisions. It’s a rare drink that uses vermouth as its main component, notes Odell, as opposed to using the aromatized wine in a support role like in a Manhattan. In essence, the Django Reinhardt is a sour that substitutes the usual hard liquor for vermouth. However, because vermouth has less body and viscosity than a spirit like whiskey, gin or rum, the proportions are adjusted with three ounces of vermouth rather than the more typical two ounces of spirit that go into a drink like a Daiquiri or Gimlet . Besides the lower proof that accommodates midday indulgence, the other benefit is the drink’s versatility. The recipe calls for dry vermouth, and while a few years ago that meant a limited supply of options, today there are many. You can opt for something reliable like Dolin de Chambery or Noilly Prat, or you can go bold and experiment with one of the many new dry vermouths on the market. Some are older recipes that are only now being exported from their tiny European towns, while others are newer styles and approaches from small wineries across the world. Beyond traditional dry vermouth styles, there are a whole world of other vermouths, like citrus-tinged blanco vermouth, bittersweet chinato or the newly revived style of sherry vermouth. Since the fortified wine is at the forefront of the Django Reinhardt it’s a chance to explore the wide variety of options available. However, any substitution will affect the overall balance. It’s always best to taste the product before serving in case you need to dial back the simple syrup or add more lemon juice (or switch out the vermouth you’re using if it isn’t working). Along with the vermouth, lemon juice and simple syrup, the drink calls for muddled orange, which adds brightness and sweetness while keeping the drink fresh and lively.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slices'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine the dry vermouth, lemon juice, simple syrup and orange slices into a shaker and muddle to break down the orange.', 'Fill the shaker with ice and shake until-well chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with an orange slice.']",32,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dizzy-blonde-negroni/,Dizzy Blonde Negroni,Liquor.com,"Abigail Gullo knows how to throw a party. Working at bars across the country, from New York to New Orleans and now Seattle, sometimes she orchestrates a party from behind the stick; other times she entertains friends in her own backyard. Both occasions require good cocktails, so Gullo often breaks out her vintage soda siphon and pre-batches the Dizzy Blonde Negroni, a make-ahead drink that can’t fail. It features equal parts gin, Aperol and dry vermouth, plus Cointreau and a dose of water to smooth out the edges and provide a little dilution. Each ingredient is added directly into the siphon, an old-school approach that guarantees the contents are well-carbonated and delicious, from the spout straight into the glass. (Pro tip: Keep all the ingredients cold to ensure proper fizz.) This Negroni variation is less bitter than the original. The Aperol aperitivo and Cointreau orange liqueur create a lighter, orange-accented flavor profile, while the substitution of dry vermouth for sweet vermouth tamps down the richness in favor of dry, floral notes. Gullo’s soda siphon trick can work for a variety of drinks, but whenever you’re making a large-format cocktail, she says to be wary of overdoing the sugar. Start by adding all of the liquor first, followed by the bitter, sweet or sour ingredients. Then begin with half of the sugar that you’d normally use, slowly adjusting the flavors, and being sure to taste as you go.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rose-cobbler/,Rosé Cobbler,Liquor.com,"Rosé is warm weather’s favorite wine, and each summer glasses are filled with still and sparkling rosés bursting with fresh florals, juicy red berries and crisp minerality. Cobblers are another refreshing go-to when temperatures heat up. This cocktail template is defined by drinks that feature any spirit or wine with sugar, seasonal fruit and often an herb, then shaken and served over crushed ice. Sometimes fate (or a bartender) conspires to put the two together in concoctions like the Rosé Cobbler, a refreshing cocktail by bartending veteran Naren Young . The Rosé Cobbler calls for rosato vermouth, Aperol, strawberry puree, rhubarb shrub, lemon juice and rhubarb bitters. So, it’s not exactly rosé wine, but rosato vermouth is made from a blend of white and red wines, which result in the liquid’s pink color. This particular version, made by Italy’s Martini & Rossi, is flavored with Sri Lankan cinnamon and Madagascan cloves for a spiced and floral flavor. Aperol , a low-alcohol aperitif with flavors of orange, gentian, rhubarb and cinchona, lends a subtle bitterness and its trademark bright red-orange color, while strawberry puree provides a fruity sweetness. This recipe requires one DIY ingredient, rhubarb shrub, which you can quickly make at home by combining chopped rhubarb with sugar, raspberry vinegar, coriander seeds and pink peppercorns. Lemon juice and rhubarb bitters bring additional balance and complexity. Once your drink is shaken, strained and garnished, go ahead and throw a straw in your glass. It will help you access the delicious liquid lurking between the crushed ice, and the classic Sherry Cobbler is likely what popularized straws in the first place. 7 Rosé Cocktails You Absolutely Need to Try This Summer RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'strawberry puree'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rhubarb shrub'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mixed berries', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'powdered sugar', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rosato vermouth, Aperol, strawberry puree, rhubarb shrub, lemon juice and rhubarb bitters to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a stemmed cobbler glass filled with crushed ice.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig, mixed berries and powdered sugar.']",6,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cafe-correccion-ponche/,Café Corrección Ponche,Liquor.com,"Coffee is best known as a morning pick-me-up, while cocktails most often appear at night, but coffee and cocktails are popular partners, joined together in several classic and modern drinks, from the Irish Coffee to the Espresso Martini . It should come as no surprise, as baristas and bartenders are two groups who obsess about quality ingredients and flavor profiles. The best coffee cocktails consider how their constituent parts will play together, pairing certain coffees with certain spirits, liqueurs and mixers. Some drinks benefit from simple drip coffee, while others require the strong taste of espresso and others still, like the Café Corrección Ponche, call for the rich and silky character of cold-brew. The Café Corrección Ponche comes from bar pro Eric Alperin, who opened the acclaimed cocktail bar, The Varnish, in Los Angeles in 2009 and has also worked in or contributed to several other great bars around the country. The drink is essentially a coffee-laced Rum Punch , and to make it Alperin enlists demerara sugar, orange peels, añejo rum, Punt e Mes vermouth, fresh orange juice, simple syrup and cinnamon. He starts by muddling the sugar and orange peels, and then letting them sit for about an hour. The sugar absorbs the citrus oils, creating a rich orange-infused sugar to sweeten the punch. Añejo rums are aged, adding oaky barrel notes like vanilla and toffee to the sugarcane spirit, while Italian-made Punt e Mes has a bittersweet taste that merges an herbal backbone with orange accents. Rich cold-brew coffee brings caffeine to the party, but also a rich, silky vein of flavor. The fresh orange juice and simple syrup round out the punch with bright citrus and a dash of sweetness.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sin-cyn/,Sin Cyn,Liquor.com,"The Sin Cyn is a potent, flavorful cocktail created by Philadelphia bartender Paul Dellevigne. To make it, he combines scotch with a couple of Italian ingredients: Cynar, a low-proof digestivo made from 13 herbs and plants—most prominently artichokes—and Carpano Antica Formula, a rich sweet vermouth with notes of vanilla, spices and wild herbs. The three components are employed in equal parts, which keeps construction easy. The drink shares common traits with a couple of classic cocktails. It’s part Rob Roy (scotch, sweet vermouth, bitters) and part Boulevardier (bourbon, Campari, sweet vermouth). In the latter case, Dellevigne swaps out bourbon for scotch and subs Cynar in place of Campari, another bitter Italian liqueur. But the results are similar: a rich and warming whiskey drink with herbal, bittersweet accents. For the scotch, Dellevigne likes to use The Macallan 12-year-old, a full-bodied, sherry-influenced single malt from the Speyside region of Scotland. A different scotch can be used if The Macallan 12 isn’t available, but for the best results, stick with a similar bottling. A light blend or a peaty Islay dram won’t achieve the same flavor profile.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gotham/,Gotham,Liquor.com,"Dating back to the late 1800s, the Manhattan is one of the world’s most popular cocktails. Composed of American whiskey, sweet vermouth and aromatic bitters, it’s spirit-forward but well-balanced, and it has graced bar menus and home bars since its inception. That pedigree and continued success haven’t kept bartenders from tinkering with the formula, however, which is great news for drinkers. Today, there are countless riffs on the classic recipe, from simple variations that swap out the base spirit or vermouth to complex variations that channel the original’s character but feature a slew of different ingredients. One liberal variation is the Gotham, a Manhattan-inspired concoction from Julie Reiner , the co-owner of pioneering New York bars Clover Club and Leyenda. She skips whiskey entirely, choosing to make the drink with vodka, rosa vermouth, amaro and orange bitters. Vodka is a relatively neutral spirit that lets a cocktail’s other flavors shine. Reiner’s drink calls for Hangar 1, a California vodka made from wheat and grapes. It’s fresh and floral, with notes of honeysuckle and pear, and it has a silky mouthfeel that doesn’t get lost in the glass. Rather than sweet vermouth, which could overpower the vodka, Reiner enlists Cocchi Rosa, a red wine-based aperitif that is flavored with herbs and spices, including gentian, cinchona, citrus zest and rose petals. Next up is Ramazzotti, which may be the world’s oldest commercially made amaro. It was invented in 1815 by a Milanese herbalist from a mix of 33 herbs, flowers, roots and other botanicals. Flavors include Sicilian oranges, turmeric, star anise, rosemary and gentian. It’s bittersweet and lively on the palate, adding rounded notes to the cocktail that pair nicely with the vodka and vermouth. Finally, two dashes of orange bitters complete the package with additional complexity and structure, plus a hint of zesty citrus. The Gotham cocktail isn’t the Manhattan most drinkers are used to. At first glance, it doesn’t even resemble the classic. But dive into the layers of vodka, vermouth and amaro and you get a spirit-forward, well-balanced drink that nods to the original. And, most important, you get a tasty cocktail that embodies the fun you can have by stepping outside the box and breaking some rules. 6 Things You Should Know About the Manhattan RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cocchi Americano Rosa vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ramazzotti amaro'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, vermouth, amaro and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",0,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jockey-club/,Jockey Club,Liquor.com,"Drinkers are privy to an endless string of Manhattan variations, from classics like the Rob Roy and modern-classics like the Red Hook to new riffs that appear every day. The cocktail’s three-part recipe is ripe for experimentation, with some versions hewing closely to the original and others taking a wide berth. This particular variation is the Jockey Club, which sticks close to home with bourbon, sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur. The recipe was provided by bar pro and distiller Allen Katz, but it’s an old drink that first appeared in David Embury’s 1948 book, “ The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks .” It’s essentially a bourbon Manhattan with a dash of maraschino liqueur and no bitters. The first Manhattans mixed in the late 1800s used rye whiskey, and many recipes continue to call for the same base spirit today. Rye is generally spicier than bourbon, but bourbon is a popular choice in Manhattans that doesn’t stray too far in flavor profile. Sweet vermouth rounds out the whiskey with its herbal botanicals and floral edges. Maraschino liqueur is nothing like the bright-red cherries used to top ice cream sundaes. It’s made with Maraska cherries, which are small, firm and slightly sour fruits that were originally cultivated on the Dalmatian Coast of Croatia. Several companies produce maraschino liqueurs, but most are bittersweet, and many contain hints of an almond-like character. Stir your ingredients together, and you get a spirit-forward, well-balanced cocktail that’s like a mix between the Manhattan and Red Hook (the latter also calls for maraschino liqueur). Interestingly, there is another Jockey Club recipe that calls for gin, fresh lemon juice, creme de noyaux (a 19th-century French liqueur made with apricot and cherry pit kernels, bitter almonds and other botanicals), simple syrup and bitters. This one hit the print circuit first, appearing in Harry Craddock’s famous 1930 tome, “ The Savoy Cocktail Book .” It’s unclear why two wholly different recipes were given the same name. But it could simply be that the authors enjoyed horse races. Both London and New York, where Craddock and Embury resided, hosted Jockey Clubs. 21 Cocktails to Make for the Kentucky Derby RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a brandied cherry on a cocktail pick.']",25,bourbon

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coronation-no-1/,Coronation Cocktail No. 1,Liquor.com,"The Coronation Cocktail No. 1 is a classic drink that appeared in Harry Craddock’s 1930 book, “ The Savoy Cocktail Book .” It popped up again in 1935 in A.S. Crockett’s “ The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book .” But despite its inclusion in two of the world’s most famous cocktail tomes, it has remained relatively obscure throughout the years. This may be due to its chief ingredients being dry vermouth and fino sherry rather than robust whiskey or gin. Don’t sleep on these flavorful lower-ABV ingredients: Dry vermouths are herbal and floral, while fino sherries are dry and crisp, with nutty notes of almond. Together, they are a perfect pairing in aperitifs like the Coronation No. 1. Vermouth and sherry can also be found in drinks like the Bamboo , which features equal parts dry vermouth and dry sherry, plus bitters, and the Adonis , which calls for equal parts sweet vermouth and fino sherry. Such cocktails are great before dinner or anytime you want a lighter drink than other stirred classics like the whiskey-based Manhattan . In this recipe, the vermouth and sherry receive a helping hand from maraschino, a bittersweet liqueur distilled from cherries. A few dashes of orange bitters season the cocktail with zesty citrus notes and a through line of complexity. Not much is known about the origin of the Coronation Cocktail No. 1, but it’s believed that the drink was created for the 1902 coronation of England’s King Edward VII. There are other Coronation cocktails in existence, including one featuring gin, Dubonnet and dry vermouth, hence this recipe’s numerical differentiator. 16 Bartenders Pick the Most Underrated Cocktails in Existence RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sherry'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dry vermouth, fino sherry, maraschino liqueur and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",5,liqueur

https://www.liquor.com/bomb-pop-cocktail-recipe-5442926,Bomb Pop,Liquor.com,"Childhood nostalgia meets adult fun with this boozy take on the classic ice cream truck treat. The fruity, citrusy mix of grenadine, citron vodka, and blue curaçao is a festive alternative to your usual poolside sippers for summer and Fourth of July parties. The rocket-shaped Bomb Pop frozen treat has been an American icon since 1955, when D.S. “Doc” Abernathy and James Merritt invented the tri-colored cherry, lime, and blue raspberry-flavored ice pop in Kansas City, Missouri. The patriotic treat was an instant hit and faced almost no competition until the Popsicle brand launched its own Firecracker Pop in 1989, similar to the Bomb Pop in both appearance and flavors. These seemingly innocent ice pops sparked some intense legal drama: Firecracker’s parent company, Unilever, sued Bomb Pop’s owner, Wells Enterprises, in 2014 for imitating its packaging. Wells countersued, stating that Popsicle’s “Original” branding misled consumers, when Bomb Pop was indeed the first explosive-themed treat. Whichever brand you prefer, both have inspired plenty of adults-only spin-offs, including boozy ice pops such as Red, White & Booze Popsicles and Smirnoff’s seasonal Red, White & Berry vodka . This refreshing and summery drink doesn’t necessarily taste like its namesake, but it’s equally delightful. Tart and fruity grenadine produces the red layer: You can make your own if you wish, but for a dependably flag-red hue, you’re probably better off reaching for the bottled stuff. Citron vodka adds its bright lemon notes to the mix, and blue curaçao, the bitter-orange liqueur that gives the Blue Hawaiian and plenty of other cocktails their electric-blue color, lends bittersweet citrusy flavor. The Bomb Pop may have simple-sounding steps for making it right in the glass, but you’ll still want to pay attention when you’re building one. Make sure to mix the blue curaçao with water to ensure it’s light enough to float on top of the grenadine and citron vodka, and add the blue mix to the drink slowly and carefully (you might try pouring it over the back of a spoon, as you would to float a layer of alcohol in a cocktail) for a striking layered appearance. The results are, dare we say, explosive. 11 Cocktails to Make for the Fourth of July RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'citron vodka'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blue mix'}]","['Add the grenadine into a highball glass over crushed ice.', 'Add the citron vodka.', 'Slowly and carefully layer the blue mix over the top.']",44,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/dirty-shirley-cocktail-recipe-5441621,Dirty Shirley,Audrey Morgan,"All child stars grow up eventually: Just look at the vodka-spiked Shirley Temple , otherwise known as the Dirty Shirley. Before seemingly every cocktail menu had a spirit-free section with thoughtfully made drinks, the Shirley Temple, named for the 1930s-era movie star, was a go-to option for non-drinkers and children alike. You might remember drinking the bright-red mix of ginger ale or lemon-lime soda and grenadine—garnished with a fluorescent maraschino cherry, of course—while the grown-ups at the table sipped more potent concoctions. The drink has multiple origin stories, but it likely debuted in the 1930s or ’40s, when its red-headed namesake was gracing black-and-white screens: Restaurants and hotels including the Brown Derby and Chasen’s in Los Angeles and The Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki have all laid claim. It’s worth noting that Temple herself wanted nothing to do with her eponymous beverage: “The Shirley Temple? Those saccharine, icky drinks?” she complained in a 1985 NPR interview . Temple even went to court twice to defend her name against companies trying to sell a bottled version of the mocktail. It’s unclear who first decided the drink would be made better with the addition of alcohol, but adults have been spiking their childhood favorite for years. And The New York Times raised more than a few eyebrows when it published a piece asking if the Dirty Shirley was 2022’s drink of the summer. After all, it’s decidedly less grown-up than 2021’s breakout star, the Espresso Martini . You can drink a Dirty Shirley at any age (over 21, of course) with the recipe below. Like the classic, the dirty version combines a simple combination of soda and grenadine. You can swap ginger ale for the lemon-lime soda, and you can certainly make your own grenadine for a more modern take, but when you’re sipping sweet nostalgia, the bottled stuff will probably do just fine. And don’t forget the vodka: It’s proof that this former child star is ready to party.

https://www.liquor.com/homemade-zima-cocktail-recipe-5324713,Homemade Zima,Audrey Morgan,"If you were of drinking age in the mid-1990s (or especially, perhaps, if you weren’t yet), chances are you cracked open a bottle of Zima. Just as White Claw has become synonymous with spiked seltzer, Zima was shorthand for the fruity beer malternatives that ruled the decade. Inspired by the “clear craze” that would also bring us Crystal Pepsi and Clear Beer, Coors filtered low-grade beer through charcoal to create the lightly carbonated lemon-lime drink. Originally marketed toward men as an alternative to “girly” wine coolers when it debuted in 1993, the drink became popular among college women anyway—and the butt of several jokes on Late Night with David Letterman . For all its cultural influence, Zima didn’t taste like much: Slate has described the flavor as “tinfoil soaked in Fresca.” And despite an out-of-the-gate success that saw 1.3 million barrels sold, the not-quite-a-beer, not-quite-a-wine-cooler never really took off. By 1996, sales had dropped to 403,000 barrels. Although it seemed destined to remain in the ’90s, like beepers and acid-wash jeans, Zima actually stayed on store shelves until 2008, and MillerCoors even re-launched the infamous fizzy drink for a limited time in 2017. Whether you’re craving ’90s nostalgia or just a thirst-quenching drink, you can make a much more delicious version of Zima at home, thanks to this recipe from Nick Jones, the former bar manager of the now-shuttered Pabu Izakaya in Baltimore and now the market manager of Sagamore Spirit. While at Pabu, Jones was inspired by the success of his bourbon lemonade cocktail, which riffed on another bottled drink: Jack Daniel’s Lynchburg Lemonade . This take on Zima is equally refreshing: A mix of vodka, the Japanese milk-based soda Calpico, lemon and lime juices, and sugar is topped with club soda. The neutral vodka base ensures the resulting cocktail goes down as easy as the drink that inspired it, and tangy Calpico soda lends citrusy flavor and a slightly milky mouthfeel—not to mention it’s an export of Japan, the only country where you can still buy Zima today (You can find Calpico at many Asian markets and some grocery stores, including Walmart). Freshly squeezed lemon and lime juices, meanwhile, balance the sweetness of the soda and sugar for a drink that’s no joke. Note that the quantities given below make one serving but can easily be multiplied to fill multiple bottles or a pitcher. It might taste better than the original, but some things remain the same: It’s still best enjoyed poolside, on a hot summer day.

https://www.liquor.com/cajun-martini-cocktail-recipe-5218591,Cajun Martini,Audrey Morgan,"The Cajun Martini was never meant to be enjoyed. When the late New Orleans chef Paul Prudhomme and his wife Kay opened their eponymous restaurant K-Paul’s Louisiana Kitchen in 1979, they didn’t even plan to serve alcohol—better to ward off rowdy French Quarter revelers. But as cocktail historian David Wondrich has reported , the Chartres Street address came with a liquor license, and customers were asking for them to put it to use. So a year into the lease, Paul compromised, offering just one drink: a premixed Vodka Martini infused with jalapeño peppers. Kay allegedly invented the fiery Martini as a solution to the pair’s cocktail conundrum: The pre-batched drink was both easy to prepare and would scare off would-be drinkers. Or so they thought. Patrons soon began to order the cocktail in quantities that were no joke, eventually consuming so many so that the Prudhommes had to enforce a strict two-drink limit. New Orleans wasn’t the only city hot on the drink in the 1980s. Wondrich himself first encountered a “head-arrangingly hot” Cajun Martini at New York City’s now-closed Great Jones Café in 1983, and in 1987, the bar manager at Philadelphia restaurant Carolinas told The New York Times that one in 10 cocktails he served each night was the Crescent City staple. The drink became so popular that K-Paul’s even worked with the Sazerac company to bring a commercially bottled version to market in 1986. Neither Paul nor Kay is still alive, and K-Paul’s closed in 2020 after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. But Wondrich has kept the recipe for the restaurant’s one and only cocktail. For this pre-batched Martini variation , good-quality vodka is infused with jalapeños for eight hours, then combined with dry vermouth before chilling and serving. As with many pre-batched cocktails , the drink is perfect for making ahead of a party or other event so you can spend time with guests rather than mixing cocktails. The recipe calls for just one pepper to prevent a throat-scorching drink. Pay attention to the steeping time to ensure the vodka doesn’t get hot enough to scare away your guests—unless, of course, that’s your goal. When you’re ready to serve, a Cajun pickle garnish is traditional, but you can add any preferred pickled vegetable . 7 Great Batched Cocktails for Your Next Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '(750 mL) bottle', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'jalape', 'ingredient': 'jalape'}, {'quantity': '3 to 4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'Garnish:', 'ingredient': 'pickled vegetable'}]","['Pour out enough vodka (3 to 4 ounces) from the bottle of vodka so that the jalapeño can fit in the bottle without making it overflow.

https://www.liquor.com/vodka-martini-cocktail-recipe-5076791,Vodka Martini,Dylan Garret,"Though cocktail purists may insist that gin is the only proper way to make a Martini , the Vodka Martini’s enduring popularity shows that not all agree. While gin will open added dimensions of aroma and flavor to create a more complex cocktail profile, using vodka as the base spirit will create a cleaner drink that allows the subtler notes of vermouth to more effortlessly come through. There’s no definitive origin story to who first popularized swapping gin for vodka in a classic Martini—the list of claims is too long to be worth going into detail—but the practice grew in the mid-20th century as efforts increased to grow vodka’s acceptance in the U.S. market. The spirit was often described to unfamiliar consumers as “white whiskey” or “flavorless gin,” and found an audience in those seeking cocktails with lighter profiles. The Right Way to Order a Martini RELATED ARTICLE Consequently, in the ensuing years, substituting vodka for gin in an array of formerly gin-based cocktails became mainstream. For the Martini, this practice perhaps reached its peak of visibility after Ian Fleming’s fictional spy James Bond first enjoyed a “medium dry vodka martini…shaken not stirred” in the 1962 film version of Dr. No . (Notably, in the original novel Casino Royale , Bond’s preferred specifications for what’s now known as a Vesper Martini called for both gin and vodka, with a heaver proportion of gin). Regardless of its murky origins and rise to fame, the Vodka Martini is still a popular Martini variation that will work well for drinkers who seek a clean, straight-forward cocktail that doesn’t overwhelm the palate with overly complex flavors. Vodka can also provide something of a blank canvas for those seeking to experiment with the growing array of dry vermouth options on the market. Without the weight of gin’s often juniper-heavy notes dominating the cocktail, vermouth’s often more herbal and citrus-forward notes have room to stand and be better appreciated on their own.

Order one while taking in the sweeping views of Phang Nga Bay and the islands and rock formations in the distance to (re)confirm your vacation status. The cocktail is reminiscent of the Thai hot and sour soup of the same name. It combines vodka with Cointreau, lime, lemongrass and its secret weapon, a TomYam syrup made from a closely guarded recipe. (“Tom” refers to the boiling process, while “yam” is a spicy and sour salad.”) In this version, the syrup has been replaced with palm sugar syrup . Palm sugar is commonly used in Asian, Middle Eastern and North African cuisines, but it has recently made its way into cocktails as more bartenders explore the realm of possible sugar sources for drinks. Palm sugar often comes in chunks, so breaking it down can be a bit of a hassle, but its dark and nutty flavor is worth the effort. To amp up the aromatics, the recipe asks you to muddle a makrut lime leaf and lemongrass stalk before shaking them with the remaining ingredients.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pho-king-champ/,Pho-King Champ,Kelly Magyarics,"Savory, umami-focused cocktails are not unheard of, but neither are they the norm, with most drinks focused more on the balance between bitter, sweet and sour. Likely, the most famous of the savory family of drink is the Bloody Mary and its many offshoots . However, others, less famous, also exist, and one such drink is the Bull Shot, which essentially swaps the tomato juice in the Bloody Mary for beef bouillon while keeping the Worcestershire, spices and hot sauce. Despite its name, however, the Bull Shot is generally served as a full drink—that gets altered with the Pho-King Champ, which swaps the beef bouillon for Vietnamese soup broth and serves the whole thing as a single savory shot. “A twist on the classic Bull Shot reimagined through the lens of Vietnamese pho,” is how Chad Solomon, the co-creator of Midnight Rambler in Dallas, describes it. The name is a nod to the defunct San Francisco avant rock band The Fucking Champs, who were forced to change their name from The Champs when they were called out by the original 1950s band. Along with vodka and a bit of dry sherry for some extra salinity and richness, the house-made pho broth is the backbone of the drink. While labor-intensive, it provides an intense depth of flavor. If you don’t want to take the time to make it, you can set aside a few ladlefuls from your favorite pho joint.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kamikaze/,Kamikaze,Dylan Garret,"The Kamikaze is a combination of vodka, lime juice, and orange liqueur. It was invented on an American naval base in Japan after World War II before experiencing a surge in popularity during the vodka cocktail reign of the 1970s and '80s. While the drink is often unfairly maligned by self-serious drinkers, primarily due to it commonly being served as a shooter, the Kamikaze is essentially just a vodka Margarita and follows the standard template of any classic cocktail in the sour family. Why the Kamikaze Cocktail Still Works Despite the Kamikaze's status as a guilty pleasure among many drinkers and bartenders, using quality ingredients and fresh juice creates a drink that's as respectable as any other. While poor recipes of past eras would often simply utilize vodka and Rose's Lime Juice Cordial or sour mix, this recipe calls for a full two ounces of vodka mixed with orange liqueur and freshly squeezed lime juice. This drink works by utilizing the classic balance of the sour family of cocktails—equal parts sweet and sour flavors to balance sugar and acidity. The main difference between this drink and the classic Margarita is simply the base spirit—using vodka in place of tequila creates a more neutral base that allows the tangy bite created by the fresh lime and orange liqueur to shine through more prominently. Aside of the obviously Margarita connection, fans of the Lemon Drop or the Cosmopolitan —which was created as a cranberry-infused riff on the Kamikaze—should also enjoy this drink. Be sure to shake thoroughly with ice for at least 10 seconds and double-strain the liquid to remove any ice shards. It can either be served as solo drink, up or on the rocks, or strained into two shot glasses to share with a friend. Because taking shots should always be a team sport.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/apple-cranberry-moscow-mule/,Apple Cranberry Moscow Mule,Liquor.com,"Unlike the majority of classic drinks, the Moscow Mule has a somewhat transparent history. Reportedly, in 1941 one John Martin—the president of a liquor production company that acquired the Smirnoff brand—partnered with bar owner Jack Morgan to create a drink that would sell Martin’s newly acquired vodka as well as Morgan’s backlog of Cock ‘N Bull ginger beer. And so the Moscow Mule was born. Of course, this narrative is likely reductionist and perhaps omits other figures, but what is clear is that the drink was popularized in the early 1940s in order to sell vodka to the American market—and the Moscow Mule very much did that. It’s no surprise that the Moscow Mule remains one of the most popular cocktails of the last 20 years: It’s easy to make and easy to drink and is often served in a special copper mug. Its effortless execution means the drink lends itself well to tweaks and variations, as with the Apple Cranberry Moscow Mule. This autumn-inspired recipe is straightforward, pairing cranberry-apple and lime juices with the usual vodka and ginger beer. And while this mule variation might evoke fall flavors, it’s a pleasure year-round. One of the best elements of a mule is the flexibility of each ingredient; while you can always hew traditional by using Smirnoff and Cock ‘N Bull ginger beer, you can also veer into fresh territory, using whatever vodka you prefer along with your favorite ginger beer. Keep in mind, though, that swapping ginger ale for the ginger beer will remove some of the signature spice from the drink and likely make it sweeter. Don’t have copper (or tin) mugs? It’s acceptable to use a highball or large rocks glass instead. Along with fresh fruit garnishes, it will still be a visual stunner even without the iconic vessel—and it won’t taste different, at all.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cbd-moscow-mule/,CBD Moscow Mule,Liquor.com,"Are you CBD-curious? Making your own CBD cocktails is a fun , relatively easy way to experiment with cannabis’ most famous nonintoxicating compound. In recent years bartenders have explored using cannabidiol (CBD) to enhance their creations, whether that’s by using infused oil floats on drinks like the Dirty Martini , or using a premade CBD soda and adding gin and lime juice . And while there is no concrete scientific evidence that CBD has strong health benefits, there have been studies suggesting it has anti-inflammatory properties, and both research and anecdotal evidence has shown it can help reduce pain and anxiety. CBD oils can be very earthy, which can make it tricky to pair with other ingredients. Luckily, there’s an answer for that in the iconic Moscow Mule . In this recipe created by Janelle Lassalle —an artist and recipe developer specializing in cannabis products—the freshness and gentle spice of ginger beer and ginger syrup complements the earthy CBD oil. Throwing some citrus into the mix evens out the ensemble, with the end result a cocktail that’s refreshing, mellow and easy on the stomach. While the Moscow Mule is recognizable by its signature copper mug, don’t feel obligated to use one. If you have one on hand, great; if not, feel free to use a highball glass or double rocks glass. Similarly, ginger ale can be used in a pinch if ginger beer isn’t available. Once you’ve made the CBD-ginger syrup it can also be used in other drinks. Why not try it in a Dark ‘n Stormy to enhance the ginger flavor, or substitute the simple syrup in an Old Fashioned or a Daiquiri to add some earthy, gingery kick to them?

https://www.liquor.com/night-at-the-spritz-cocktail-recipe-5074496,Night at the Spritz,Liquor.com,"Spritzes and high balls are generally great choices for lower proof drinks, especially ones like the classic afternoon tipple of Campari & Soda. But for some that’s still too much; whether you’re cutting out alcohol for good, replacing some drinks in an evening with something non-alcoholic, or simply taking a break for a day or two or more, there are plenty of great reasons to opt for something zero proof. However, one of the difficulties in replacing alcoholic drinks with booze-free alternatives is the challenge of replicating the taste. A Campari & Soda, for instance, is particular—it’s nearly impossible to replicate the flavors of a fermented or distilled beverage, especially a deep botanical one like Campari. And just making a bitters & soda or even a non-alcoholic shrub doesn’t always scratch that particular itch or satisfy the craving for a bitter, botanical spritz. Luckily, recent years have seen brands and distillers who have stepped forward to create non-alcoholic takes on a variety of spirits and liqueurs. The Night at the Spritz—a nonalcoholic cocktail created by bartender Alison St. Pierre of King in New York City—uses one such product to replicate the Mediterranean culture of aperitivi and digestivi and its traditional low-alcohol midday refreshers like said Campari & Soda. In it, St. Pierre replaces the iconic Italian liqueur with Ghia , a nonalcoholic faux-liqueur flavored with yuzu, orange and ginger. Ghia was the creation of Melanie Masarin, who grew up spending summers on the Mediterranean, and wanted to capture that cultural obsession with aperitivi while providing the opportunity to enjoy the drinks without alcohol consumption. Ghia does most of the heavy lifting in the Night at the Spritz, with soda adding effervescence and helping to open up and express Ghia’s aromatics and botanicals. For those who want it sweeter or with more kick can try another kind of soda; grapefruit sodas, for instance, work rather well with the flavors of the Ghia. An orange twist and a sprig of rosemary supply extra aromatics, and the result is a foolproof mocktail suitable for brunch, apertivo hours, and after-dinner imbibing without the risk of a headache the next day.

An exception is this spirit-forward take on an Old Fashioned , made with makrut lime leaf and lemon peel, multiple types of bitters, and Mekhong. “In a cocktail, you can juice it up or let Mekhong speak for itself, as in our Thai Old Fashioned,” says Suansilphong. “It’s an intensely flavored cocktail that works with our intensely flavored food.” First produced in 1941 in a distillery once run by the Thai government, Mekhong is the closest thing Thailand has to a national spirit. It’s distilled from a co-ferment of 95% molasses and 5% rice and then blended with native herbs and spices and sweetened with honey. Its characteristic color comes from added caramel rather than barrel aging, and generations of Thai drinkers have erroneously referred to it as whiskey when it’s, essentially, a rum. Mekhong isn’t available in all U.S. markets, so if you want to make the Thai Old Fashioned and can’t find any, substituting a spiced rum is an acceptable move and will lead to a lovely drink. Unlike a traditional Old Fashioned, which generally only receives a few dashes of Angostura bitters, the Thai Old Fashioned also gets orange and chocolate bitters. Together with the Angostura, the additional bitters coax out the fruit and richer notes of the mekhong. The muddled lime leaves, which are tougher than mint and won’t break down in the drink much, along with the lemon add a good amount of zest that brightens and enlivens the cocktail. Regardless of whether you use mekhong or spiced rum, this is a drink that will pair nicely with spicy, aromatic Thai dishes.

As a general rule, Tep Bar does not serve classic cocktails, but the Mantra is an exception, born from a “sneak attack” from a well-known bartender who came into Tep Bar one night and ordered a Negroni . Bowing to hospitality, one of Tep’s bartenders combined ginger and date-infused Mekhong with Campari and sweet vermouth, creating the Mantra. First produced in 1941 in a distillery once run by the Thai government, Mekhong is distilled from a co-ferment of 95% molasses and 5% rice and then blended with native herbs and spices and sweetened with honey. It’s named after the Mekhong River that flows from China through Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia to Vietnam, and it’s the closest thing Thailand has to a national spirit. Its characteristic color comes from added caramel rather than barrel aging, and though it’s closer to a spiced rum than any other liquor, generations of Thai drinkers have erroneously referred to it as whiskey. As it’s closer in flavor profile to a whiskey than a gin, it might be more accurate to say the Mantra is a twist on a Boulevardier , the Negroni’s darker hued sibling. Regardless, if you can’t get your hands on Mehkong but want to make the Mantra, using a spiced rum will get you the closest approximation.

And while it certainly works well in a Margarita or Sidecar , it also pairs well with a wide spectrum of flavors including, oddly enough, carrots. Zachary Faden, an experienced bartender from Washington, D.C., shows this fact off with the Aquavit Buck, an unusual aquavit-based highball. The drink includes a cordial made with carrots and Grand Marnier, which Faden calls a “wonderful and uncommon pairing.” Aquavit is often considered a Scandinavian equivalent to gin, usually flavored with caraway or dill, as well a botanicals like cardamom and fennel. This brightly botanical spirit forms the base of this highball, which also gets a ginger syrup and the carrot cordial for sweetness and depth. “Grand Marnier is a classic backbar staple that certainly deserves front-row status. It offers cocktails citrus brightness, vanilla aromas and nutty nuance,” Faden says. “[The cordial] marries with the ginger and accentuates the herbaceous aquavit.” If you enjoy the drink and its ingredients, you can use them in other cocktails, too. The ginger syrup can easily be used to add some gentle spice to drinks, like an extra-warming Hot Toddy or a zesty take on a Daiquiri .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pisco-sour/,Pisco Sour,Liquor.com,"Chile and Peru bicker fiercely over the Pisco Sour’s origin (and that of pisco, too), but by most accounts, the drink’s genesis is tied to a United States citizen. Expat bartender Victor Morris is believed to have concocted the frothy, smooth cocktail at his Lima bar around 1915 or perhaps the early 1920s. Blending pisco, lime juice, egg white and Angostura bitters, the Pisco Sour is earthy, sweet and tart—a cocktail worth fighting over. Pisco is a grape-distilled spirit that was first made in the 16th century. Piscos vary in style and grape variety, with different expressions ranging in flavor from dry and earthy to floral and fruity. The Pisco Sour doesn’t call for a particular pisco, so enterprising drinkers can experiment to find which they prefer. Spirit, citrus, sugar and egg white are the core ingredients in a good sour, including the popular Whiskey Sour . But one small difference that’s become emblematic of the Pisco Sour is its inclusion of Angostura bitters. The aromatic bitters, which are usually applied as a garnish, add color and fragrance to the cocktail. Those bitters sit on the drink’s fluffy head, a trait achieved by dry-shaking the cocktail. That means shaking it first without ice to incorporate the liquid ingredients with the egg white before shaking it again with ice to provide chill and dilution. The result is a delicious cocktail with a silky mouthfeel that can provide refreshment whether you’re hiking in the Andes or drinking on the beach.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/caipirinha/,Caipirinha,Liquor.com,"Chances are high you encountered Brazil’s national drink, the Caipirinha, if you’ve traveled to the South American country. Refreshing and easy to make, the cocktail contains fresh lime juice, sugar and cachaça. The latter is a spirit as central to Brazilian identity as samba, soccer and carnival. So much so that cachaça is also the country’s national spirit, inextricably tying this drink to its home. First made in the 1500s, cachaça is similar to rum, sure, but has a flavor all its own. Most rums are distilled from molasses, a byproduct of sugarcane processing, while cachaça is distilled from the fermented juice of sugar cane. This important difference yields a spirit that is characterized by its funky, grassy flavors. And those singular flavors set the Caipirinha apart from other sweet-and-sour cocktails like the Daiquiri . It’s unclear exactly when the Caipirinha first appeared, but many historians believe it was served in the early 20th century as a remedy for illness. Others say it was invented in the 19th century by Brazilian farmers as a way to showcase local sugarcane. Regardless of how or when it was born, drinkers have gravitated toward its sharp, pleasing flavors and heady effects ever since. The Caipirinha is easy to make and can be constructed right in the glass. But its build instructions are exacting. Lime juice and simple syrup won’t get the job done. Instead, the drink requires lime wedges and finely granulated sugar. Muddling the limes with the abrasive edges of granulated sugar helps release not only the fruit’s juice, but also the rich, aromatic oils from the lime’s peel. The Caipirinha is not a cocktail that requires improvement. But that’s never kept bartenders from experimenting and tweaking the original recipe. The most common variation is the Caipiroska , which is made with vodka in place of cachaça. Other variations call for muddling fruits like raspberry or pineapple with the lime. Whichever route you choose, the Caipirinha is refreshing and flavorful. Plus, it has a unique ability to bring you straight to the tropics, no matter where you happen to be drinking one.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/absinthe-drip/,Absinthe Drip,Jim Meehan,"For years, American drinkers were tantalized by tales of the supposed hallucinogenic effects of the banned spirit absinthe. But while the alcohol packs a wallop (the proof ranges from 110 to 145), it’s not actually mind altering, and since 2007 the so-called “green fairy” can once again be purchased legally in America. Drinkers now have a large selection of both foreign and domestic absinthes to choose from, including the historic Pernod Absinthe ($77) with fennel and hyssop on the nose and mint and anise on the palate; the California-made St. George Absinthe Verte ($60) with aromas of mint, green pepper and fennel and a bittersweet bite; and the artisanal Vieux Pontarlier Absinthe ($70) with hyssop, anise and dark chocolate on the nose and a savory finish. The production of absinthe is much like that of gin. A high-proof neutral spirit is infused with a blend of botanicals, including wormwood, and redistilled in a copper pot still. Traditionally, the liquor is infused a second time before bottling to intensify the flavor and create the signature green color. Many producers skip this final step and use dyes instead. There are basically two ways to drink absinthe. The traditional preparation is to slowly drip water over a sugar cube and into the spirit, which becomes cloudy. (An excellent selection of traditional absinthe glassware, spoons and fountains is available at Maison Absinthe.) You can also use small quantities of absinthe—a few dashes, a rinse or one quarter of an ounce—to add a floral, bittersweet quality to just about any cocktail. With absinthe not only legal but now quite easy to find at liquor stores and bars, you can enjoy a real Sazerac or a Corpse Reviver #2. Then try my Green Deacon recipe, with gin, sloe gin, grapefruit juice and an absinthe rinse. I’ll take good drinks over hallucinations any day.

Mix classic drinks like the Sazerac and Corpse Reviver No. 2, and a bottle of absinthe could last you a lifetime, or at least a few dozen drinks. But sometimes, absinthe stars in the show. You can find it playing a big role in cocktails like the Death in the Afternoon, the Absinthe Frappé and the Green Beast. The Green Beast is not just a reference to the Hulk. It’s a drink that was created in 2010 by bartender Charles Vexenat, an award-winning bartender who’s worked in London and Ibiza. At the time, he made the drink for Pernod Ricard as a way to show off the brand’s absinthe. The cocktail has passed the test of time and is one of the most well-known absinthe cocktails of the modern age. The drink is essentially an update to the Absinthe Frappé, which features absinthe and anisette liqueur over crushed ice. But Vexenat’s Green Beast takes a unique turn by employing fresh cucumbers and lime juice to complement the high-proof absinthe.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/death-in-the-afternoon/,Death in the Afternoon,Liquor.com,"Ernest Hemingway is known as much for his writing as for his drinking. Through his books and throughout his life, he championed cocktails like the Daiquiri and the Mojito , but nothing stirs the imagination quite like the Death in the Afternoon. This potent mixture of absinthe and Champagne shares a name with Hemingway’s 1932 book about Spanish bullfighting. Supposedly, the drink was created by the author after enjoying absinthe during his time in France. Death in the Afternoon was also his contribution to “So Red the Nose, or Breath in the Afternoon,” a 1935 cocktail book featuring recipes from 30 celebrity authors. In the book, Hemingway says: “Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly.” It’s rare that classic cocktails include such exacting details, but leave it to an author to record his instructions for posterity. (Of course, you’re free to consume fewer than the recommended dose.) The cocktail’s opalescent milkiness occurs when the Champagne hits the absinthe. The aromatic compounds in absinthe are more soluble in alcohol than in water, so when the absinthe is diluted, those compounds drop out of solution and crowd together—what we see as cloudiness. This process is evident in the classic Absinthe Drip , which combines absinthe with cold water and sugar. Science aside, the Death in the Afternoon is a smart foray into absinthe for those who are new to the spirit. The easy drink merges the wormwood-and-anise-flavored liquor with dry, bubbly wine, creating an effervescent cocktail that’s strong but surprisingly refreshing.

They’re consumed with lunch, before dinner, at brunch, and at any situation that calls for a refreshing drink—and under the Northern Portugal sunshine, well, that’s plenty. This drink riffs on that classic two-ingredient pairing. “Low-ABV, effervescent, and refreshing,” says Javelle Taft, the head bartender at Death & Co. NYC , of this cocktail created by his colleague Marc Rizzuto. Tall and bitter, it highlights white port, Bonal, Chareau aloe liqueur, and cucumber. Even beyond this highball, Death & Co. bartenders often send blanc vermouth to the bench in various drinks, instead using white port in place of the fortified wine. “White ports have a slightly higher sugar content than vermouths, which make them a touch more appealing when being used in Martini-style cocktails and two-part drinks,” says Taft.

In his take on a classic Chrysanthemum , the recipe for which was first published in Harry Craddock’s The Savoy Cocktail Book in 1930, Lavenue adds a hefty pour of white port to the white-vermouth-and-Benedictine formula, dressing it up even further with a chamomile infusion and a bit of verjus blanc.

Whether in the bold style of Bandol rosés or a more gently aromatic Provencal one, or somewhere in between, that pink bottle is perfect for summertime Sangria drinking. This recipe doubles down on the pink with the addition of rosy-hued pamplemousse liqueur, adding grapefruit’s trademark tangy bitter flavor balanced by a hint of sweetness.

That’s only a suggestion, however; use it as a starting point and feel free to throw in whatever you like best and is most in-season. Grapes, blueberries and cubed watermelon would all make fantastic additions to this drink.

https://www.liquor.com/white-sangria-recipe-5191601,White Sangria,Liquor.com,"A glass of good Sangria is one of the joys of summertime. The question is: Should you go red, white or rosé ? Classic red Sangria brings deep, lush notes. But White Sangria goes lighter and brighter, not just with the wine that forms its base but the fruit within as well. Think stone fruits and bright citrus. You can take the fruit any way you want, really. This recipe calls for peaches and green apples, but you can throw in just about anything you like: strawberries, blueberries, cherries, grapes, plums or even lychee. If you have some extra time and you want to go extra hard and boozy with it, you can cut up your fruit in advance and marinate it for a few hours (or overnight) in gin or vodka, throwing in a hefty splash of orange-flavored triple sec if you like. Your choice of wine is just as flexible, within reason. You’ll want to aim for one that’s relatively dry and crisp to balance the fruit’s sweetness; something along the lines of a chenin blanc or pinot grigio would be a good pick. After mixing it all up, let it sit in your refrigerator for a few hours to allow the flavors to combine—but not for too long, since you don’t want to let the fruit soften to the point of mushiness. An hour or two is sufficient; don’t let it sit longer than four. Fill each wine goblet two-thirds full and top it off with a splash of seltzer or club soda (or cava or prosecco, if you’re feeling particularly decadent) if you want to add bubbles, or fill it all the way to the brim with the wine-and-fruit mixture to get the fullest flavor.

https://www.liquor.com/white-port-tonic-cocktail-recipe-5190869,White Port & Tonic,Emily Cappiello,"A classic Gin & Tonic is the quintessential summer drink. Thirst-quenching, bubbly and with a bite of booze, this sipper is a go-to for both patio time and dinnertime. At times, however, the desire for a cool, refreshing drink may give way to a craving for something with deeper, richer flavor notes. Enter the White Port & Tonic, now growing in popularity across the United States for its complex, elevated flavor, as well as its versatility with seasonal ingredients. The first time many drinkers encounter a White Port & Tonic is in Portugal—it’s the country’s answer to Italy’s Aperol Spritz , if you will. For Portuguese drinkers, a Porto Tonico is ingrained in the sipping culture. “It also allows people to feel as if they’re having a pre-dinner cocktail without having to make the switch from a spirit to a wine when it comes time for dinner,” says Adrian Bridge, the CEO of Taylor Fladgate, a major producer of port wine . “It’s a very versatile aperitif and one that’s common in Portugal.” White port itself can be served chilled and consumed solo. But the addition of tonic water turns the wine, with its flavors of apricot and citrus, into something that feels effervescently special. The white port itself has a unique flavor profile, light and vibrant, says Maxime Belfand, the bar director at Saxon + Parole , but brings a level of depth and sophistication to a mixed drink. “The beauty about mixing white port and tonic is the perfect balance between the sweetness of the port and the slight bitterness of the tonic,” he says. “You end up with a perfect balanced drink with a low ABV.” Not quite as crisp as a traditional Gin & Tonic, a White Port & Tonic blends honeyed and nutty white port with the slight bitterness of tonic water to produce a full-bodied cocktail. White port also combines well with the many types of “upscale” tonic waters now available (think aromatic, Mediterranean-style, or citrus- or cucumber-flavored, to name just a few) for an even more unique cocktail. “White port and tonic is one of those fantastically versatile drinks that has the wonderful added benefit of being so easy to prepare,” says Andy Seymour, a bar educator and the owner of Liquid Productions . Seymour says that the White Port & Tonic is virtually a blank slate, allowing a bartender to tailor its flavors with garnishes as they like. A lemon wheel or an orange twist is most traditional, but Seymour suggests that apple or pear slices or stewed cranberries can bring additional flavors to the forefront and highlight some of the wine’s natural flavor notes; adding herbs like rosemary or sage will enhance the aroma. Once you’ve got the basics down, play around with other garnishes to customize them to the season and your own flavor preferences.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/penicillin/,Penicillin,Liquor.com,"The Penicillin cocktail was created by Sam Ross in the mid-2000s, when he was working at New York City’s famous Milk & Honey bar. The drink quickly gained a foothold as a modern-classic cocktail. It’s now served around the world, proving its status as one of the 21st century’s biggest cocktail success stories. In creating the drink, Ross decided to riff on the Gold Rush , another Milk & Honey original, that features bourbon, lemon juice and honey. He skipped the bourbon and instead opted to mix blended scotch with fresh lemon and a homemade honey-ginger syrup, which added sweetness and the classic bite of ginger. Ross then added a float of peaty scotch from Islay , an island known for producing smoky whiskies. The blended scotch, lemon and sweetened syrup create balance in the drink, similar to that which you’ll find in a Whiskey Sour. The Penicillin is sweet, tart, spicy and delicious, garnished with a welcome snack of candied ginger. But that topper of Islay scotch is the genius behind the cocktail, keeping the spirit’s smoky aromatics front and center with each sip.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/clover-club/,Clover Club,Liquor.com,"The Clover Club cocktail can be traced back to the late 1800s and Philadelphia’s Bellevue-Stratford hotel. This popular hangout drew crowds of writers, lawyers and titans of industry, who convened to talk about issues of the day. Naturally, their meetings included drinks, and the Clover Club with gin, fresh lemon juice, raspberry syrup and egg white was a favorite among this genteel set. The pre-Prohibition classic is one of Philadelphia’s greatest contributions to cocktail history, but like many drinks of its day, the Clover Club all but disappeared for most of the 20th century. Eventually, it found its way back into rotation, helped in part by its appearance in modern cocktail books, including Gary Regan’s “ Joy of Mixology .” Its resurgence was solidified in 2008, when Julie Reiner opened a cocktail bar in Brooklyn named for the classic drink. Naturally, the bar put a Clover Club on the menu, and the cocktail has remained there since. Any high-quality gin can make a great Clover Club, but a good London dry gin will complement the cocktail’s tart fruit and silky body. While egg white is optional in some drinks (and it’s technically optional in this one, too) its role is important, adding texture and yielding a luscious, foamy head when shaken and strained. This recipe calls for raspberry syrup, an easy-to-assemble ingredient that requires only one more step than a traditional simple syrup . However, if you’d like to save a few minutes of stove time, you can take a shortcut by muddling three or four fresh raspberries with a half ounce of simple syrup right in the shaker.

But give tequila the nod over vodka and employ some hot sauce, and you get the Bloody Maria, an agave-kissed spin on the classic. The Bloody Maria has no known origin date or location, and it’s likely that it has existed in some form for decades.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coquito/,Coquito,Céline Bossart,"Rich, creamy Coquito is a classic Puerto Rican cocktail made with coconut cream, coconut milk, baking spices and, most important, rum. It is a centerpiece of the year-end festivities for many families on the Caribbean island. The History of Coquito “My mother would make Coquito every year for the holidays,” says New York bartender Darnell Holguin, co-founder of The Silver Sun Group. “She would make a variation that is very similar to eggnog, called Ponche [de Coquito], which [includes] egg and condensed milk added for nutrition during difficult economic times in Puerto Rico in the 1940s.” Aside from Coquito’s nostalgic allure, Holguin is a die-hard fan of the beverage for its singular texture and balance. Coquito is rich and zippy; festive and comforting; boozy and homey. Coquito, which translates to “little coconut” in Spanish, has deep roots in Puerto Rican history—or, at least, Spain’s colonization of the island. Holguin elaborates: “It is said that the Spanish brought [Coquito] over by introducing the island to their version of an eggnog . Utilizing the abundant resource of coconuts on the island, a version was created that is unique to Puerto Rican culture.” Today, there are countless family recipes specific to Puerto Rican households on the island itself and in the Puerto Rican diaspora across the world. But there’s one key Coquito element that remains entirely non-negotiable, according to Holguin. “There is always one important ingredient that must be in Coquito, and that is Puerto Rican rum. ” Why Coquito Works While there’s plenty of room for interpretation and experimentation when making Coquito at home, you’ll want to follow a few general guidelines from an expert like Holguin. “When making your Coquito, it’s important to use a good coconut milk—read the labels on the cans you purchase and make sure you get one that has a lot of coconut fat. This is what gives this drink great texture and body,"" says Holguin. None of that light coconut milk. You want full-fat coconut milk. The kind you would use in a Thai curry. Or, as done in this recipe, you could go even fattier and use cream of coconut for its inimitable richness and dense coconut flavor. ""Also, sourcing quality spices like good vanilla extract and cinnamon makes a world of difference,” notes Holguin. If you wanted to really amplify the spice notes in your Coquito, you could use a real vanilla bean, scraping the seeds into the base, and grind your own cinnamon from cinnamon sticks. “The balance of fatty texture and a dry finish from spices and the rum makes Coquito irresistible and impossible to just have one cup!” This large-batch recipe, contributed by legendary bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez, is an excellent place to begin your Coquito explorations.","[{'quantity': '56', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweetened condensed milk'}, {'quantity': '48', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'evaporated milk'}, {'quantity': '24', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cream of coconut (such as Coco Lopez)'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'vanilla extract'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'ground cinnamon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'ground nutmeg'}, {'quantity': '750', 'unit': 'milliliters', 'ingredient': 'white, añejo or spiced Puerto Rican rum'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon sticks', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, cream of coconut, vanilla extract, ground cinnamon and ground nutmeg into a saucepan over medium heat.

These tried-and-true party drinks are simple to make, instant crowd-pleasers, and easy to create ahead of time in large batches to cut down on serving and cleanup hassle. And just because it's a cocktail served in semi-solid form doesn't mean you can't create a high-quality Jell-O Shot using proper spirits and complementary flavors, rather than grain alcohol and neon food coloring. Vodka and white rum are both great options for your alcohol, although other spirits, like gin, whiskey, tequila and brandy all work. How to Make Jell-O Shots Jell-O Shots, in their most basic form, require just three ingredients: gelatin, water and liquor. Any flavor of gelatin will work, but don't use the unflavored variety, unless you're adding additional ingredients or your guests just truly enjoy the taste of chewy hard liquor. While this recipe follows the original three-ingredient Jell-O Shot template, it can be tweaked to create countless other variations. With a little extra effort, it's possible to create a range of classic crowd-pleasing cocktails in Jell-O Shot format, whether the Whiskey Sour , Margarita or Daiquiri. To do this, you need to match the cocktail ingredients with the liquid requirement in the recipe. For example, if you’re making a Daiquiri and using one package of gelatin, the rum, lime juice, and simple syrup should maintain their proper ratios while keeping the total volume of non-boiling liquid (cocktail plus cold water) to eight ounces. In this example, using white rum as your base spirit, you could simply replace the 4 ounces of cold water listed below with two ounces of lime juice and two ounces of simple syrup, to create a Daiquiri Jell-O Shot. As long as you keep the general proportions and swap the cold water with an equal amount of other cold, non-alcoholic ingredients, you should be able to experiment to your heart's content and come up with an endless array of interesting combinations.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Jell-O'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'boiling water'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cold water'}]","['In a medium bowl, stir together the Jell-O and boiling water until the Jell-O dissolves.', 'Add the vodka or rum and cold water, and stir to combine.', 'Pour 1 ounce of the mixture into each of the 16 shot glasses (small plastic or paper cups will also work) and chill until solid.']",126,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dark-n-stormy/,Dark ’n Stormy,Kevin Gray,"The Dark ’n Stormy is a delicious, easy-to-make cocktail that features a refreshing trio of dark rum, ginger beer and lime. It also goes down a lot easier than the moody name might imply. It’s a close cousin to the Moscow Mule (vodka, ginger beer, lime) and should be an easy transition for vodka drinkers wanting to try something new, but also familiar. The History of the Dark ’n Stormy The popular cocktail can be found all over the world, from craft cocktail bars and chain restaurants to island hideaways. Its origin, like that of many drinks, is a bit hazy, though it’s likely that rum and ginger beer were first combined by sailors who enjoyed the obvious benefits of rum and the stomach-settling qualities of ginger. But Dark ’n Stormy’s direct lineage can be traced squarely to one island in the Atlantic Ocean. Goslings Black Seal is a rich, flavorful rum from Bermuda, where the rum’s long history dates to 1806. Goslings Black Seal features notes of caramel, vanilla and spice, and technically, this rum is the only rum that can be used in a Dark ’n Stormy. The brand Goslings lays claim to the drink; in 1991, it successfully registered a trademark dictating that any drink titled Dark ’n Stormy must be made with only Goslings rum. The company has even sued other beverage brands that have attempted to peddle the drink with their own rums as its star. So, if you really want the full Dark ’n Stormy experience, make it with Goslings. Why the Dark ’n Stormy Works Rum, ginger beer, and fresh lime juice—these three ingredients each play a vital role in the success of a simple cocktail like the Dark ’n Stormy. The rum, as discussed, must be Goslings Black Seal. It has loads of character, thanks to a combination of pot and column still distilling and aging in charred American oak. Note that ginger ale is not a substitute for ginger beer . Ginger ale is just carbonated water that’s flavored with ginger, like a soda. Ginger beer, on the other hand, is brewed and fermented (though the “beer” label can be misleading, as most versions are nonalcoholic). If you try making your Dark ’n Stormy with ginger ale, you’ll still produce a solid drink. But the rich Goslings rum benefits from the stronger flavors and spicier bite of real ginger beer. Many recipes, including this one, call for a modest measure of lime juice to be added to the rum and ginger beer, which lends a pleasant kick of citrus. But the lime juice is optional. If you’re drinking in Bermuda, the cocktail will most likely be served with just rum and ginger beer, plus a lime wedge, so the drinker can squeeze the lime at their discretion. But any way it’s served, the Dark ’n Stormy is tasty and refreshing.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spiced-rum-milk-punch/,Spiced Rum Milk Punch,Liquor.com,"The Milk Punch is a classic cocktail that traditionally combines brandy or rum with sugar, vanilla extract and milk (of course). Its history is extensive, dating to at least the 1600s, when the recipe first appeared in print. Benjamin Franklin was a fan, and so was Queen Victoria—so there’s a reasonable chance you’ll like it, too. Today, it’s common to find all manner of Milk Punches, including clarified versions, in which citrus is used to curdle the milk, the solids are strained, and you’re left with a beautifully clear cocktail. This Spiced Rum Milk Punch, however, sticks close to the traditional version. It comes from bartender Abigail Gullo, who created the drink while working at Sobou in New Orleans, a town with a predilection for the creamy concoction. Gullo starts with spiced rum, merging the flavorful spirit with milk, simple syrup and vanilla extract before dusting the surface with freshly grated nutmeg and cinnamon. The result is similar to Eggnog —which is a type of milk punch—but minus the egg. So it’s a great option for anyone who desires a rich and delicious treat that’s quick and easy. The Spiced Rum Milk Punch and its many cousins can be enjoyed any time of day, but they are most popular during brunch, particularly in New Orleans. The combination of protein-packed milk with eye-opening rum is enough to kick-start any morning. A Bartender Put Milk Punch in a Bottle. So Everyone Could Try It.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/winter-mojito/,Winter Mojito,Liquor.com,"The Mojito is a consummate summer libation: mint, rum, lime and club soda create a refreshing and intoxicating mix that begs to be sipped out on a beachfront, lawn or front porch on a sunny afternoon. But unless you live in the cocktail’s birthplace of Cuba or another tropical locale, it’s likely a good portion of the year involves fewer sunny afternoons and more cloudy, rainy and even snowy ones. That shouldn’t keep you from enjoying a Mojito any time of year, though, especially if it’s a rich and botanical variation like the Winter Mojito. This all-season highball comes from Eden Laurin, a food and beverage consultant and a managing partner at Chicago’s famous Violet Hour, known for its bold and experimental cocktail program. In the pursuit of the perfect cold-weather take on a Mojito, Laurin spices aged rum with warming cinnamon, cloves and star anise. A splash of Licor 43—a Spanish liqueur flavored with vanilla, herbs and spices—adds aromatics, and demerara syrup adds darkness and caramel notes. While there are plenty of options for spiced rum that do not involve home infusion—such as Kraken, Cruzan 9 Spiced Rum, and Sailor Jerry—making spiced rum at home provides the opportunity to customize the flavor profile. Laurin’s recipe calls for cinnamon, clove and star anise, but feel free to tweak to your preferences. Adding ginger would bring the drink closer to a Dark ’N Stormy , another delicious winter rum drink. A bit of nutmeg and orange peel add up to a lovely holiday sipper that behaves as well in a Spiced Eggnog or Hot Buttered Rum as it does in the Winter Mojito.

The Chinese 5 Spiced Dark ’n Stormy, however, hails from Portland, Oregon. It was created by bar veteran Jeffrey Morgenthaler, and it tastes a lot more complex than its two-ingredient recipe suggests. Morgenthaler starts with Gosling’s Black Seal rum, sticking true to the original cocktail’s chosen spirit base. But he infuses the rum with Chinese five-spice powder, a flavorful blend that typically includes cinnamon, fennel seeds, star anise, Sichuan peppercorns and cloves and is meant to encompass all five tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The powder, which is commonly used in some Chinese cooking, adds a welcome zing to the otherwise straightforward cocktail. It complements both the rum’s sweet spices, stewed fruits and vanilla and the ginger beer’s spicy heat. The infusion yields a full bottle of doctored rum, so you will have plenty at your disposal. Make a batch the night before you entertain some friends, and you can quickly make everyone drinks by mixing the rum and ginger beer in a tall glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jacq-la-ginger/,Jacq La Ginger,Liquor.com,"The Dark ’n Stormy is a beloved highball for its zesty, peppery and rich profile. A mixture of Gosling’s blackstrap rum and ginger beer with a splash of lime, it’s an easy drink to throw together, and an easy to drink to tweak, with bartenders across the world creating their own variations on the classic. One such variation is the Jacq La Ginger. Adapted from The Bluffton Room at Hilton Head Island in Bluffton, South Carolina, the drink is named for the famed female pirate of the Caribbean, Jacquotte Delahaye. Thought to have been born in Saint-Domingue in 1630 to a French father and Haitian mother, she was known for her fiery red hair, for which the drink is partially a pun on—the “Ginger” in Jacq La Ginger refers to both it and the ginger beer in the drink. The most popular legend attached to her name is that she faked her own death at one point, and when she returned she was known as Back From the Dead Red; there are even a few wines and beers named for that moniker. Originally, Delahaye also gave her name and image to the rum used in the Jacq La Ginger: Redlock spiced rum from Hilton Head Distillery , also on Hilton Head Island. That particular rum has since been rebranded as simply Hilton Head Distillery Spiced Rum, so the connection isn’t quite a robust as before. Nevertheless, like the Dark ’n Stormy’s requirement of being made with Gosling’s blackstrap rum, it’s not really a Jacq La Ginger if it’s not made with spiced rum from Hilton Head. However, if that’s unavailable, another high quality spiced rum can do the trick, especially one heavy with vanilla, allspice and nutmeg like Hilton Head. Normally a Dark ’n Stormy calls for just a splash of lime juice to add some tart acid, but the Jacq La Ginger calls for two full ounces of grapefruit juice. Though sweeter than lime juice, it still brings a lot of acid to the party, which means some sugar is needed to balance it. In this case, a brown sugar syrup, rather than simply syrup, adds in some of the familiar Dark ’n Stormy richness that blackstrap rum normally does. Finally, like any Dark ’n Stormy, this recipe calls for ginger beer. It’s worth noting that ginger ale, which is a flavored soda, is distinct from ginger beer, which is naturally fermented with real ginger. 5 Recipe Variations Every Dark ’n Stormy Lover Should Know FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'spiced rum'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'brown sugar syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dill sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, juice and syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the ginger beer and stir gently and briefly to combine.', 'Garnish with a dill sprig.']",0,rum

Alongside classic cocktails like the Death in the Afternoon and Sazerac , the Gaslamp opened with a menu featuring several original drinks. One favorite was the Velvet Sea, a crushable showcase of spiced rum given additional spice, sweetness, and tart layers from falernum, pineapple gum syrup, fresh lime juice and a heavy float of Angostura bitters. Sailor Jerry rum is made from a blend of Caribbean rums and spices and sports flavors of vanilla and oak, with hints of clove and cinnamon. At 92 proof, the rum stands up to the other ingredients rather than getting lost in the shuffle. Pineapple gum syrup is a sweetener that’s similar to pineapple-infused simple syrup , but traditional gum syrups feature gum arabic, an emulsifier made from the sap of the acacia tree that adds a silky viscosity to cocktails. You can find formulas for DIY syrups online if you want to make your own, but there are a handful of commercially available options, including the pineapple gum syrup from California-based Small Hand Foods used in this recipe.

The reputation is deserved, but limited. Rums—and particularly aged rums—work just as well during winter. The flavorful sugarcane spirit is complex and versatile and can be combined with ingredients like winter citrus fruits and warming spices to create seasonal drinks even during the coldest months. Storm the Beach hails from The Cocktail Club in Charleston, South Carolina. Bar manager Ryan Welliver puts an inventive spin on the usual rum cocktail by merging two types of rum with two types of citrus. That pairing receives a little sweetness from falernum and a spicy kick from an infused syrup made with cinnamon sticks and toasted cumin seeds, while a couple dashes of Tiki bitters lend additional complexity and balance. The fun doesn’t stop there. Storm the Beach is affixed with a flaming lime shell garnish that is created simply by pouring overproof rum into a spent lime shell and setting it alight.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/undead-gentleman/,Undead Gentleman,Liquor.com,"Tiki godfather Donn Beach opened his original Don the Beachcomber bar and restaurant in Hollywood in 1933, just as the American social scene was having a renaissance on the heels of Prohibition’s repeal. It was at this Hollywood institution that Beach created some of his most iconic cocktails, including the Zombie , which saw a mix of rums, absinthe and syrups blended together into a potent and delicious concoction. The drink spawned plenty of variations, and the Undead Gentleman is a standout of these. Shaken rather than blended and lacking a few of the Tiki syrups the original demands, it’s a bit easier to make and just as easy to drink. Modern tiki icon Martin Cate developed the Undead Gentleman and printed the recipe in his cocktail book, “Smuggler’s Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, and the Cult of Tiki.” The drink also draws inspiration from the Jet Pilot , another Tiki staple drink, borrowing its falernum (a lime-tinged spiced almond liqueur or syrup, in simple terms), grapefruit juice and a cinnamon simple syrup, rather than the Zombie’s Donn’s Mix. In fact, it could be argued that this drink is closer in DNA to a Jet Pilot, but we’ll let the Tiki nerds debate that one. In any case, its base is a mix of rums, including a full ounce of overproof 151 rum. This means it packs a serious punch, so temperance is encouraged when imbibing. One major distinction of the Undead Gentleman is that rather than being flash-blended like its predecessors, it’s a shaken drink. This means you won’t even need a blender to whip up a batch for yourself and some friends. The glass gets a rinse of absinthe first, and you’ll want to stick to a clear absinthe rather than the more familiar green color to maintain the cocktail’s brilliant orange hue.

The Irish Coffee and Hot Toddy are two classics that continue to please drinkers with their warming sensibilities. But if you want something with an extra-rich kick to it, try the Hot Buttered Rum . Versions of this drink date back to Colonial America, and recipes began appearing in printed form in the 1800s, most notably in Jerry Thomas’s famed 1862 “Bartenders Guide.” Inclusions in mid-20th century Tiki tomes followed, cementing the cocktail’s place in history and on modern menus. Like most classics, the Hot Buttered Rum’s pedigree does not protect it from tinkering, as bartenders and drinkers across the globe have tweaked the recipe to their liking. One such iteration is the Hot Caramel Buttered Rum, which includes caramel-flavored vodka in the mix. The Hot Caramel Buttered Rum starts out traditional, with butter, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and rum. The caramel-flavored vodka provides a twist, with an additional punch of sweetness and flavor. A few brands make caramel vodkas, including Pinnacle, Smirnoff, Stoli and Van Gogh. The best examples are sweet and decadent, with rich veins of burnt sugar and caramel flavors accented by undertones of vanilla, chocolate and toffee. In this recipe, which makes two drinks, rum is still the star, outweighing the vodka three-to-one, but the flavored vodka is potent enough to stand up and make itself known, adding a rich caramel note to the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/diamond-claret-cup/,Diamond Claret Cup,Liquor.com,"For those who have gotten tired of making cocktails that all fall under a familiar umbrella of Negroni variations , modified Margaritas or tweaks on the Old Fashioned , San Francisco bartender John Codd has a solution: the Diamond Claret Cup features unorthodox ingredients, including a split base of red wine and raspberry brandy. Raspberry brandy, also known as framboise , may not be as ubiquitous as something like apple brandy, but there are plenty of distillers around the world producing it. In the Diamond Claret Cup, Codd uses raspberry brandy from St. George Spirits , a lauded craft distillery in the Bay Area. The bright, floral eaux-de-vie from the distillery are excellent, and the raspberry brandy will serve well in this drink, but another clear raspberry brandy could be substituted if need be. For the red wine, it’s best to use whatever you have on hand—say from a bottle you’ve opened to go with dinner. But keep in mind that brighter, more fruit-forward wines with a full body will work best—overly earthy red wines may overwhelm the other ingredients, while something too light, like a Beaujolais nouveau, could get lost. Along with the unusual base of wine and raspberry brandy, the cocktail is sweetened with other less common ingredients: rather than simple syrup, Codd uses equal parts grenadine ( a pomegranate syrup ) and gum syrup, which is similar to simple syrup only more viscous; it’s often referred to as gomme syrup, which is the French spelling. Codd uses Small Hands Foods, a producer of historic cocktail syrups, for both the grenadine and gum syrups, but you can use whichever brand you prefer. Be sure to avoid anything artificial for the grenadine, and you can always consider making your own . The drink is topped with a half-ounce of sparkling wine.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/naughty-or-nice/,Naughty or Nice,Liquor.com,"One of the oldest forms of mixed drink, punch spent a number of decades relegated to cloying concoctions overly sweetened with fruit juices and syrups. But thanks to the work of bartenders like famed cocktail historian David Wondrich—who wrote an extensive text on the history and concept of large scale, shared drinks—punch these days can be a righteous affair, as good as any single serving cocktail. One such influential bartender is Jamie Boudreau. The Seattle bartender is the owner and founder of Canon , one of the country’s most celebrated whiskey bars. However in this boozy punch Boudreau skips the whiskey in exchange for another brown spirit: cognac. To that he adds an unusual combination in a punch: two wines of different colors, equal parts chardonnay and pinot noir. Since they’re being mixed with spirits and ginger ale, there’s no requirement to go super high-end here. Instead, leave the cru Burgundies for drinking on their own. It’s still important, though, to make it with some decent wines that you’d actually want to drink, with or without the addition of cognac, cherry liqueur, and ginger ale. Boudreau uses Fat Bastard wines. Similarly, the cognac should be of good quality, though that’s easy enough to do as the famous brandy region doesn’t produce much in the way of bottom-shelf spirits. Same for the maraschino liqueur. While the most obvious label to reach for is the wicker-wrapped bottles from Luxardo, there are alternatives. And while the recipe calls for ginger ale, feel free to substitute in ginger beer, which will cut down on the sweetness a bit and add extra gingery spice from the naturally fermented soda. Either way, be sure to go for a product of higher quality, without any artificial flavorings or corn syrup, as those can spoil an otherwise good punch. This recipe makes enough to share between two. If you’re serving a larger group, as punch is normally made for, adjust the recipe accordingly: one bottle each of pinot noir and chardonnay, 18 ounces each of cognac and maraschino liqueur, and around 36 ounces of ginger ale, which is easy enough as that’s three ordinary 12-ounce bottles. Alternatively, mix everything but the ginger ale in a punch bowl with a large block of ice and top each individual glass with ginger ale.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Chardonnay'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Pinot Noir'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cognac'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'ginger ale'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: blood orange slices', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the chardonnay, pinot noir, cognac, maraschino liqueur and ginger ale, along with a large block of ice, to a punch bowl.', 'Divide between punch cups or rocks glasses with fresh ice, and garnish each with a blood orange slice.']",4,liqueur
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/springs-first-bloom/,Spring’s First Bloom,Liquor.com,"This bright and floral cocktail from bartending veteran Charlotte Voisey is aptly named. Through a mixture of floral and herbaceous liquors and bitters, the drink evokes the early days of spring as flowers start to spread their perfume. At the base of Spring’s First Bloom is Hendrick’s gin. This famous Scottish gin should preferably not be substituted with another, as its cucumber and botanical notes are distinct and crucial to the aroma and flavor of the drink. If you use a traditional London Dry instead, you’ll lose out on much of the garden elements that define the cocktail. The drink’s herbaceous and floral components include elderflower liqueur St-Germain (here, you can substitute another brand of elderflower liqueur) and lemongrass-infused simple syrup. Although the syrup takes some time to put together, you can use it to add an interesting touch to your favorite Daiquiri or Gimlet recipe. It’s also an ingredient in the South Mint 75 . Lemon juice gives the cocktail its necessary acidic tartness, and lavender bitters heighten the flowery notes. Finally, egg whites give the drink a silky mouthfeel and help to incorporate all the flavors into a springtime treat that can be enjoyed year-round. 20 Cocktails to Make This Spring RELATED ARTICLE",[],"['Add the Hendrick’s gin, St-Germain, lemongrass-infused simple syrup, lemon juice, lavender bitters, and egg white into a shaker and vigorously dry-shake (without ice).', 'Add ice and shake again until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a single mint or microgreen leaf.', 'For lemongrass-infused simple syrup: Combine 4 cups granulated sugar and 4 cups water and stir until the sugar dissolves completely.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/frenchie/,Frenchie,Liquor.com,"The Frenchie cocktail is an original recipe from Los Angeles bartender Somer Perez. To make this refreshing, three-part drink, she combines gin with St-Germain elderflower liqueur and fresh grapefruit juice. Floral St-Germain, which is made in France from hand-picked elderflower blossoms, is a natural complement to gin’s strong, botanical base. The same can be said for grapefruit juice. The tart fruit works wonders with the juniper and citrus notes in gin—just look at the Salty Dog . Different gins will produce slightly different versions of the drink. Something softer with a more modern flavor profile will take a backseat to the grapefruit and St-Germain, while a juniper-forward London dry gin will stand up tall in the cocktail. So, if you want to taste the gin, you can’t go wrong with a classic London dry. With its gorgeous pink hue and easy-to-make recipe, the Frenchie is a prime candidate for parties, showers and other occasions, but those occasions don’t need to be relegated to the evening.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ramos-gin-fizz/,Ramos Gin Fizz,Kevin Gray,"Many cocktail origin stories are shrouded in murky lore, but the Ramos Gin Fizz is an exception. It was first mixed in 1888 by Henry Charles “Carl” Ramos at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans. Along with drinks like the Sazerac , the Ramos Gin Fizz is one of the city’s most identifiable cocktails, and one that has stood the test of time, as it’s still in circulation today. However, this frothy classic is both loved and loathed by bartenders. The drink, which combines gin, citrus, simple syrup, egg white, heavy cream, orange flower water and club soda, is a panoply of flavors and textures. The gin—most recipes call for London dry, but Ramos himself used Old Tom, as was fashionable in his time—provides a sturdy base for the cocktail, while the sugar and citrus add their trademark sweet-tart balance. Heavy cream lends richness, the egg white bulks up the mouthfeel, and the orange flower water provides a floral note. Finally, sparkling water lightens the drink, adding a touch of effervescence. Then, of course, there’s the shaking. The story goes that Ramos employed a chain of “shaker men” in his bar to meet the constant demand from locals and tourists, who had become enamored with the labor-intensive cocktail. Supposedly, each drink was shaken for between 12 and 15 minutes, which we can all agree is a lot of minutes. But don’t let that fun fact discourage you. Foamy, fresh, floral and delicious, the Ramos Gin Fizz is worth rolling up your sleeves for—and today, most bartenders shake their Fizzes in under a minute. Acclaimed New Orleans barkeep Chris Hannah says that between 25 and 45 seconds is sufficient. If you want to use the dry-shake method, he suggests agitating the shaker for 10 seconds sans ice, and then giving it another vigorous go for 15 seconds with ice to ensure proper chilling and dilution. The result is a perfectly mixed Ramos Gin Fizz with a head that’s the right amount of frothy—thick, but not approaching meringue pie.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/house-made-clover-club/,House-made Clover Club,Liquor.com,"The Clover Club is one of the iconic greats of cocktail history. Born sometime in the late 19th Century, its first recorded appearance was at the Philadelphia’s Bellevue-Stratford hotel. It’s essentially a Gin Sour —gin, citrus, sweetener and egg white—with a touch of raspberry syrup to give it that signature crimson hue. Like many cocktails it waxed and waned in popularity over the decades, but its legacy was cemented by the opening of Brooklyn’s Clover Club in 2008. Founded by Julie Reiner, this swanky cocktail lounge with vintage aesthetics always has its namesake on the menu, but the bartenders here put a signature twist on it, deviating from the original recipe in a few key and interesting ways. The drink starts the same as normal, with a few measures of London dry gin—even something as ubiquitous as Tanqueray or Beefeater works well here, as the boldness of their juniper profiles stand up well to the other ingredients. The first and biggest change, however, is the inclusion of dry vermouth. This adds an extra botanical depth to the drink, as well as a light salinity and savory notes. Then, instead of using the usual half ounce of raspberry-infused simple syrup, the recipe calls for a teaspoon of raspberry jam. This makes it simpler to prepare, especially if you have some leftover jam from breakfast or teatime in the fridge. From there, the House-made Clover Club hews close to the original recipe, with lemon juice and egg white. It differs a bit though—rather than a whole egg white, which is normally around a half ounce (and can vary wildly), it calls for only a quarter ounce, just enough to give it its signature foamy top and smooth mouthfeel . The end result is a drink that is unmistakably the Clover Club, and yet notably different. The pro move is to make a batch of both drinks and contrast and compare. You may find that you prefer the bar’s more savory take, or perhaps you better enjoy its sweeter, richer parent drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/peeping-tom/,Peeping Tom,Liquor.com,"Peeps, those oddly addicting marshmallow candies that look like conjoined chicks with a staring problem, are usually the last thing left in the Easter basket. This holiday, turn them into a cocktail garnish with the Peeping Tom, a festive riff on the Aviation . The Aviation dates back to the turn of the 20th century and features gin, maraschino liqueur, creme de violette and lemon juice. It’s a floral drink with a light purple hue courtesy of the violette liqueur. The Peeping Tom follows suit, calling for gin, creme de violette and lemon juice, but it takes its own path by skipping the maraschino liqueur in favor of simple syrup, which eliminates the classic’s bittersweet cherry notes. It also opts for Old Tom gin , a style characterized by a sweeter, maltier profile that falls somewhere between genever and London dry gin. Shake everything together, and you get a clean drink bursting with flavors of gin, tart lemon and the floral creme de violette. All in all, it’s a pretty standard cocktail until you consider the garnish. Because sitting on the rim of your glass are two bright-yellow Peeps marshmallow candies watching your every move. Naturally, the Peeping Tom is a good fit for Easter celebrations, so break it out for brunch or as part of an adult-friendly Easter basket.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/corpse-reviver-no-2/,Corpse Reviver No. 2,Kevin Gray,"The Corpse Reviver No. 2 is a classic drink that belongs to a family of pre-Prohibition cocktails that were said to be created and consumed for the chief purpose of rousing the drinker from the dead—in other words, meant to cure hangovers, increase vigor and otherwise improve one’s morning. Corpse Revivers can be traced back to at least the 1870s, with many lost to the ravages of time. This version is the best known recipe, although the Corpse Reviver No. 1 (cognac, Calvados, sweet vermouth) is still in rotation today and enjoys occasional placement on bar menus. Like many Prohibition-era cocktails, the Corpse Reviver No. 2 faded into obscurity over the decades, but it was resuscitated during the aughts as bartenders looked to history for inspiration. Its adoption was driven by the drink’s inclusion in Harry Craddock’s “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” a seminal tome originally published in 1930 that introduced dozens of classic drinks to modern drinkers. Today, the Corpse Reviver No. 2 is a popular fixture at craft cocktail bars and an occasional option at brunch joints that embrace the drink’s ability to jump-start the morning. If you order one, remember that the cocktail is more potent than it tastes. When in doubt, heed Craddock’s warning: “Four of these taken in swift succession will un-revive the corpse again.” Why the Corpse Reviver No. 2 Still Works The Corpse Reviver No. 2 features gin, Lillet blanc (a French aperitif), orange liqueur and fresh lemon juice, used in equal parts, shaken with ice and served in a glass that has been rinsed with absinthe. The base combination follows the standard ""sour template"" of cocktails, meaning it utilizes a base spirit in combination with a balance of sweet and sour elements, in the form of liqueur and citrus. Lillet Blanc is a fortified, aromatized wine that functions the same way vermouth does in countless other cocktails, helping to bind together and smooth out the ingredients while adding depth of flavor. 10 Cocktails to Make with Lillet Blanc RELATED ARTICLE The absinthe rinse is a key component of the Corpse Reviver No. 2. A small amount of absinthe is poured into the glass, swirled around to coat the interior, then discarded. The result is a hint of absinthe that primarily comes through aromatically, or on the nose as you sip, but doesn't overwhelm the palate or throw the balance of sugar out of whack. The result is a tart, cold and refreshing cocktail—precisely what you need to either start or end the day.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/corpse-reviver-no-blue/,Corpse Reviver No. Blue,Liquor.com,"When the craft cocktail renaissance was in full swing in the mid-aughts, two things were certain: Long-forgotten drinks were back in vogue, and there was a bartender backlash to the sweet, neon-colored drinks on the ’80s and ’90s. The newly-rediscovered Corpse Reviver No. 2 , with its heady mix of gin, lemon juice, Lillet Blanc, Cointreau and absinthe became a hit, popping up on bar menus all over the world. And the blue drinks that dominated prior decades were generally laughed out of the bar. Bacardi brand ambassador Jacob Briars created the Corpse Reviver No. Blue as a joke, but it’s become a popular order, so he gets the last laugh. It is essentially the same drink as a Corpse Reviver No. 2, but it swaps out orange-flavored Cointreau in favor of orange-flavored blue curaçao —hence the name and the color. His homage to the classic offered a playful nod to the self-serious industry and proved that blue drinks could be craft-focused and delicious. The Corpse Reviver No. Blue is produced in the same way as the non-blue original. Absinthe is used sparingly; rather than going straight into the shaker, it rinses the glass, lending hints of its anise flavor and aroma without overpowering the cocktail. The gin, lemon juice, Lillet Blanc and curaçao are shaken with ice and strained into that absinthe-rinsed glass, and a lemon twist is applied as the finishing touch. Corpse Revivers were originally designed to jumpstart one’s morning, so don’t hesitate to serve this drink after a long night. Make it for someone who likes blue cocktails, or make it for someone who professes to hate blue cocktails.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/modern-english/,Modern English,Liquor.com,"Bulldog gin is an assertive London dry gin with a robust juniper profile that stands up nicely in cocktails. It’s that assertiveness that also has it playing well in this autumnal-themed cocktail, where the gin is married with lemon, maple syrup and fresh pear. The Modern English comes from Michael Waterhouse, a longtime New York City bartender and bar consultant. The drink has a unique approach to its construction. A gin sour like a Gimlet flavored with pear is by no means unheard of, but generally that means fresh squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup and some kind of pear liqueur or pear syrup. Instead, Waterhouse uses lemon wedges, maple syrup and a pear slice, all muddled together with the Bulldog gin. Thanks to global markets and imported goods, you can make this drink anytime. However, it’s going to be best in late summer into early fall, when local pears are at their peak season in the United States. What is fun about using fresh pear rather than a liqueur or even a syrup is that you can play with your favorite varieties to see which goes best in the drink. Try a pear like an Anjou, Bartlett or Bosc and see which best suits your fancy. Likewise, feel free to swap the Bulldog Gin for your favorite gin—or whichever gin you have on hand. A lighter, more floral gin like Hendrick’s or a subtle one like Plymouth will create a drastically different final product than Bulldog. While a cinnamon stick is called for a garnish, it won’t affect the flavor of the drink too much unless you leave it in the glass for an extended time.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mrs-robinson/,Mrs. Robinson,Liquor.com,"Gin is a workhorse behind the bar. The versatile spirit can be mixed with tonic, stirred into bone-dry Martinis or shaken with fruit juices, and it works equally well in simple serves as it does in elaborate concoctions. There aren’t many ingredients that it can’t accommodate. The Mrs. Robinson cocktail displays the spirit’s friendly nature, pairing local Aviation American gin with pineapple syrup, grapefruit juice, lime juice, Peychaud’s bitters and prosecco. The drink comes from Andrew Call, a bartender at Portland, Oregon’s Bacchus Bar . He chooses Aviation gin because its complex, herbaceous flavor plays off the tart lime and grapefruit. “Adding some house-made pineapple simple syrup gives it a welcome hint of a day on the beach,” says Call. “[And] topping it off with dry sparkling wine and Peychaud’s bitters makes all the flavors come together and light up your tongue.” The Mrs. Robinson is tall, bubbly and well-balanced, blending the gin’s dry botanical notes with tart citrus and sweet pineapple. The bitters lend color and anise-tinged aromatics with each sip. If you want to sample it for yourself, start by making Call’s pineapple syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bees-knees/,Bee’s Knees,Liquor.com,"The Bee’s Kees is a Prohibition-era cocktail featuring gin, lemon juice and honey. The unique name is a convention of the time: The phrase “bee’s knees” was popular slang used to call something excellent or outstanding. The drink is credited to Frank Meier, an Austrian-born bartender who plied his trade at the Hôtel Ritz Paris during the 1920s. It’s a simple extension of the classic Gin Sour (gin, lemon, sugar) that features honey instead of sugar. The honey creates a richer drink, and it may have been employed to mask the taste of subpar gin, which was prevalent at the time. Why the Bee’s Knees Works Fortunately, today’s gin market features hundreds of excellent bottles. The days of subpar gin are (mostly) long gone, thankfully. So you can enjoy the Bee’s Knees ingredients at their best. There are two gin roads to consider taking: Using a London Dry gin will put more emphasis on the juniper, while a more modern gin imbued with citrus and florals will bring out the lemon and honey notes of the cocktail. Pick whichever gin suits your tastes, as the gin is very much front-and-center in this drink. Understanding The Main Styles of Gin RELATED ARTICLE The honey arrives in the form of homemade honey syrup, a simple combination of honey and water that adds complexity and sweetness. Choose a mild honey, such as clover or some other delicate floral type. Strong-flavored honeys will scream their name rather than whisper their presence. Lemon juice complements that nuanced sweetness with fresh, tart acidity and brings the cocktail into balance. Make the Bee’s Knees whenever you want to enjoy an easy, refreshing cocktail. Given that it’s only three ingredients, the Bee’s Knees is a good option for parties and other occasions that call for serving a crowd.

Creme de menthe is a liqueur made by adding mint leaves or extract to neutral alcohol, after which it’s filtered, sweetened, lightly aged and bottled. And white creme de cacao is a sweet, chocolate-flavored liqueur with a buttery mouthfeel. The drink was allegedly created in 1919 in New Orleans, but it didn’t become a household name until the 1950s, as Prohibition squandered the growth and familiarity of many cocktails born just before the restricted-drinking era began. The original recipe calls for the three ingredients to be combined in equal parts, resulting in a cocktail that looks like melted mint-chocolate-chip ice cream and kind of tastes like it, too. The rich, green-hued dessert cocktail became a mainstay at bars during the disco era, while in contemporary times, bartenders have upended the core blueprint, creating clarified grasshoppers, grasshopper milkshakes and other playful riffs on the flavorful classic. This version comes from New York bartending legend Dale DeGroff, who breaks the equal-parts formula and cranks up the heavy cream to round out the drink. Shake your ingredients with ice and, if you’re feeling fancy, dust some nutmeg on top. The Grasshopper can be consumed any time of day, of course, but given its sweet and creamy nature, it’s particularly effective after dinner. Order one after a good meal or make one at home in lieu of dessert.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pink-squirrel/,Pink Squirrel,Dylan Garret,"Though Wisconsin may be most well-known for the Brandy Old Fashioned , the Badger State is home to a number of iconic cocktails. The Pink Squirrel may be one of the most interesting of these, composed of white crème de cacao, heavy cream, and crème de noyaux. For those unfamiliar with crème de noyaux, it is a red-hued liqueur that’s made primarily from the pits of stone fruits like apricots, cherries, and/or peaches. It tends to taste almost almond- and marzipan-like, though most bottlings contain no actual almonds. Amaretto is commonly cited as similar in profile. The History of the Pink Squirrel The Pink Squirrel is thought to have been first created at Bryant’s Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee sometime during the 1940s. Original versions of the drink were said to use ice cream, creating something akin to a spiked milkshake, though eventually heavy cream became the standard option. This does put the Pink Squirrel firmly in a camp with other classic cream-based dessert drinks like the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander, which have also famously been created using ice cream rather than heavy cream over the years, and are colloquially still often described as “boozy milkshakes.” Grasshopper RELATED ARTICLE Bryant’s is a legendary Midwest bar, deeply tied to cocktail culture in North America. As the story goes, the bar was originally opened in the 1930s as a Miller Brewing-tied beer hall. However, after only a couple of years in operation, and despite the city’s extensive brewing culture, proprietor Bryant Sharp decided he was no longer interested in selling beer. The jukebox was removed and replaced with turntables and a hi-fi system that only played classical music, carpeting was installed, windows were blacked out to create a darker atmosphere, and Milwaukee’s first cocktail lounge was born. Bryant’s continues on to this day, sporting a menu of more than 450 cocktails, which acts as an index of some of the most famous drinks ever created. In fact, in the early 2000s, while coastal metropolises like New York and San Francisco were touting their “classic cocktail renaissance,” it could be argued that Bryant’s had been keeping the culture alive all along. Why the Pink Squirrel Works As mentioned, the Pink Squirrel shares its template with other cream-based, “milkshake” cocktails, namely the Grasshopper and the Brandy Alexander . Each of these three cocktails has two ingredients in common—heavy cream and crème de cacao—and a third that acts as a unique signature. In the Grasshopper this is crème de menthe, while the Brandy Alexander opts for its punchier namesake spirit. In the Pink Squirrel, this modifier is crème de noyaux, a liqueur made from steeped stone fruit pits. When it comes to cocktail balance, it’s easy to see why the Pink Squirrel template works—by combining heavy cream with a sugary, chocolate- and vanilla-forward liqueur and then whipping and chilling it in a shaker with ice, you are literally creating an ice cream base. The only difference between the above three cocktails is what flavor that ice cream is—the Pink Squirrel opts for the addition of its signature rich, almond-like profile. That’s all to say, the next time you’re looking for a classic dessert cocktail, give the Pink Squirrel a try. It’s as classy and timeless as ice cream, and no one’s too good for ice cream.","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de noyaux'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'freshly grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the creme de noyaux, white creme de cacao and heavy cream into a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",117,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/golden-cadillac/,Golden Cadillac,Liquor.com,"The Golden Cadillac dates back to 1952 when it was first concocted at Poor Red’s, a bar in El Dorado, California. As the story goes, a couple came in asking for a unique cocktail, and the bartender mixed together a drink with Galliano, white creme de cacao and heavy cream, calling it the Golden Cadillac after the couple’s shiny new car. Many decades later, the drink remains a fixture at Poor Red’s . While the Golden Cadillac has exhibited staying power, at least among retro cocktail lovers, it enjoyed particular popularity through the 1970s, when Galliano was king. The Italian liqueur, which was created in 1896 from a recipe that includes star anise, juniper, lavender, cinnamon and vanilla, pumped up cocktails like the Harvey Wallbanger and Fuzzy Navel , two common calls during the ’70s. Today, Galliano doesn’t get as much airtime behind bars, but it’s worth breaking out the tall, recognizable bottle to make the Golden Cadillac. Fortunately, it is a very easy cocktail to make—the three ingredients are used in equal parts, which takes math out of the equation. Shake the Galliano, white creme de cacao and heavy cream with ice and strain the mixture into your glass. If you’re feeling decadent, adorn the surface with some freshly shaved chocolate. The result is a rich and creamy cocktail sporting flavors of vanilla, chocolate and anise.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/20th-century/,20th Century,Kevin Gray,"Cocktails love gin. The flavorful, adaptable spirit tastes great when mixed with other spirits, citrus, liqueurs and even cream, with countless classic and modern examples proving this point. Not all gins are the same, however, and there’s wide variation from one to another in terms of botanicals and flavor profile. This gives bartenders and enthusiasts nearly unlimited options in creating gin cocktails. Many gin classics that still dominate today’s menus sprang to life in the 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Dry Martini and Tom Collins . One lesser-known drink from this era is named not for the time period in which it was born, but the train car that inspired it. The 20th Century Cocktail features gin, Lillet blanc, white creme de cacao and lemon juice. According to William J. Tarling’s 1937 “ Cafe Royal Cocktail Book ,” it was created by British bartender C.A. Tuck and named for the luxurious 20th Century Limited passenger train that ran between New York City and Chicago from 1902 to 1967. At first glance, the ingredients comprising the drink may seem strange. Gin’s dry nature and botanical flavor profile pair perfectly with Lillet blanc, a light and floral aromatized wine. But creme de cacao (a chocolate-flavored liqueur) and tart lemon juice do not scream synergy. However, something magical happens when you merge everything. The Lillet blanc softens the gin, while the creme de cacao adds a touch of sweetness that’s balanced by the lemon juice. And when you break down the recipe, it’s really just a riff on the Corpse Reviver No. 2 , with the creme de cacao taking the place of the orange liqueur. The 20th Century Cocktail has largely stayed out of the same spotlight that’s elevated other gin classics, but it has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years as bartenders have rediscovered the recipe. Today, you can find the drink at bars across the world, but with four easy-to-acquire ingredients, the cocktail is a good candidate for making at home. Mix one as a nightcap, and imagine you’re on its namesake train, rumbling across the tracks in style. 20 Gin Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lillet blanc'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Lillet blanc, white creme de cacao and lemon juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled for about 15 seconds.', 'Fine-strain into a chilled coupe.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",33,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pina-colada/,Piña Colada,Liquor.com,"The Piña Colada has a bit of a bad rap among cocktail connoisseurs. For years, this now-classic drink was the poster child of the blender boom, a symbol of poolside bars and booze cruises. But the tropical cocktail—a mix of rum, coconut, pineapple and lime juices—dates to the 1950s and has been satisfying vacationers and Tiki aficionados since. As the story goes, the Piña Colada debuted in 1954, when it was first mixed by Ramon ""Monchito"" Marrero, the head barman at the Caribe Hilton in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. Perez had blended up a winner, and the tropical drink enjoyed its place in the sun for decades, finding its way to American shores and faraway isles. However, the quality took a nose dive around the 1970s when barkeeps began making Piña Coladas with cheap, bottled mixers and serving them in comically large glasses. Fortunately, the drink has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, as craft-focused bartenders reclaimed the original recipe, once again focusing on solid ingredients and proper proportions. Some also opted to sub shaker tins for the traditional blender, creating a lighter, less-icy cocktail. This recipe follows that tack, silencing the blender blades and employing a nice, sturdy shake. This technique keeps the cocktail from becoming overly diluted, and serving it over pebble ice ensures a cold drink. The new-wave Piña Colada will make you forget about the bad examples served on Bourbon Street and at all-inclusive resorts. This Colada is sweet, but balanced, with crisp rum and tart fruit complementing the rich coconut. Whether you’re on vacation or just making drinks at home, don’t neglect the Piña Colada.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cocoa-a-trois/,Cocoa À Trois,Liquor.com,"The Cocoa À Trois cocktail was created by Las Vegas bartender and author Tony Abou-Ganim and appears in his book, “ Vodka Distilled .” It has rich, chocolaty underpinnings so, according to Abou-Ganim, you should choose your vodka wisely, as different vodkas bring differing elements to cocktails. “The drink will pair best with a New-World corn-based or wheat-based vodka rich in vanilla or cocoa elements,” he says. This stands in contrast to potato vodka, for example, which he says is ideal for drinks with bold, acidic elements like fruit juices (think Vodka Gimlets ) or even bitter liqueurs. Once you’ve got your vodka picked, you’ll need a few more ingredients to make this dessert-like drink. Three of them are chocolate, all in different forms: liqueur, powder and freshly grated semisweet chocolate. The first is supplied by way of Godiva chocolate liqueur, a sweet and velvety 30-proof drink that blends easily with many spirits, including vodka. The second is a scant quarter ounce of sweetened cocoa powder, which gets incorporated into the drink when shaken. From there, you’ll need a half ounce of simple syrup to add a bit more balance to the cocktail, while egg white provides a silky texture and produces a thick head after it’s shaken with the liquid ingredients. The third chocolate element, shaved semisweet chocolate, rests as a garnish on the thick head of foam. Mix the Cocoa À Trois after dinner or whenever you want a sweet treat. Because of its rich and frothy texture it’s not the kind of cocktail you’ll drink all night long, but it’s fun, delicious and a welcome departure from the typical Chocolate Martini .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/psycho-killer/,Psycho Killer,Liquor.com,"At first glance at its list of ingredients, the Psycho Killer might make you want to run, run, run, run, run, run, run away. It’s a combination of Irish whiskey, white creme de cacao, banana liqueur and coffee nib-infused Campari , which on paper is a chaotic mix of elements. However, this silky nightcap comes from bartending veteran Jillian Vose of New York City’s famed Irish bar, The Dead Rabbit, so you can rest assured it’s a quality concoction. Being from The Dead Rabbit, it’s no surprise that the drink starts with an Irish whiskey, especially one of such high quality as Redbreast 12-year-old. It’s a bit pricey for a spirit that goes into a mixed drink, but the strength and quality of Redbreast means that it will still shine through. You can, of course, mix it up and use something less expensive. One key element that makes the Psycho Killer so indulgent is the cocoa nib-infused Campari. This bittersweet Italian liqueur pairs surprisingly well with chocolate, and once you have it made you can also use it to punch up your favorite Negroni or Boulevardier recipe. The Psycho Killer gets even more chocolate, though, with the addition of white creme de cacao. It’s important to use the white creme variety—which is generally clear—or the drink will become cloudy and off-balance. The Psycho Killer also calls for a half-ounce of Giffard Banane du Brésil, which is one of the few high-quality banana liqueurs on the market. Banana is a natural pairing with chocolate, and it works surprisingly well to add depth and complexity in the Psycho Killer, without making it too sweet. If the combinations didn’t seem strange enough already, the drink also gets two dashes of absinthe. The licorice and anise flavors of the absinthe shouldn’t come through too loudly; instead, it acts much like bitters do in a cocktail, giving the drink depth and nuance and enhancing the other ingredients. The result is lush, rich and bold without being overly sweet or cloying. Though the Psycho Killer calls for a fair amount of ingredients, it may become a fixture in your home bar.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Redbreast 12-year-old Irish whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cocoa nib-infused Campari'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Marie Brizard white creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Giffard Banane du Brésil'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}]","['Add the Irish whiskey, cocoa nib–infused Campari, white creme de cacao, banana liqueur and absinthe into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Nick & Nora glass.']",14,whiskey

Besides being a handy conduit for caffeine, coffee (the good stuff) is full of oils and rich flavors that pair nicely with a variety of spirits and liqueurs, from whiskey and rum to bittersweet amari. In the aptly named Rich Coffee, San Francisco bartender Tommy Quimby combines creme de cacao, fernet and coffee into a simple eye-opener that’s flavorful and effective. Quimby uses Tempus Fugit creme de cacao, which is based on a 19th-century recipe featuring cacao from Venezuela and vanilla from Mexico. He chooses Italian-made Fernet-Branca , which brings a wallop of herbal, minty bitterness. And he pours locally roasted Sightglass coffee, which is a great option (and available online), but you can choose your favorite beans for similar results. This simple but complex-tasting trio is accented by a topper of pistachio cream. You can quickly make that yourself at home by whipping together pistachio nut paste, sugar and heavy cream. The sweet and nutty cream merges deftly with the creme de cacao’s cocoa and vanilla flavors, the Fernet-Branca’s minty bitterness and the coffee’s rich, earthy notes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-holland-house/,Holland House,Liquor.com,"The Holland House cocktail is a classic drink containing genever, dry vermouth, fresh lemon juice and maraschino liqueur. Well, to some people. Others contend that it actually features dry gin, while some claim that it’s a rye whiskey drink . In the strange way that occasionally applies to cocktails, all of these recipes are right. The first known printing of the Holland House was in George Kappeler’s 1895 book, “ Modern American Drinks: How to Mix and Serve All Kinds of Cups and Drinks .” His recipe called for rye, triple sec and bitters. In 1930, Harry Craddock’s “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ” published a Holland House recipe featuring dry gin, dry vermouth, lemon juice, maraschino and pineapple. The two drinks couldn’t be more different, yet they carried the same name. The genever-based version has no clear origin point, but it achieved popular acceptance in the early 21st century and never left. It’s the recipe you are likely to get today if you see a Holland House cocktail on a bar menu. Genever is essentially the Dutch grandfather of gin. It’s made from malted grain and flavored with juniper, creating a sweeter flavor profile than the dry and juniper-dominant London dry gins as well as the citrusy and floral modern gins. Dry vermouth rounds out some of the genever’s edges and puts this drink into Martini territory before things take a left turn with lemon juice and bittersweet maraschino liqueur, a combination reminiscent of the Aviation .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/south-side/,South Side,Liquor.com,"Ask your nearest bartender or cocktail historian to describe the South Side, and you’ll likely receive a variety of responses. Some say it’s a Gimlet with mint that’s served up in a cocktail glass. Others describe it as a gin-based Mint Julep served over ice. It’s possible that the drink was named for the South Side neighborhood in Chicago, or maybe it was invented at Southside Sportsmen’s Club on Long Island. Whichever the case, the South Side and its refreshing combination of gin, citrus, sugar and mint is a classic cocktail worth knowing—and drinking. The recipe can be traced back to at least 1916, when it appeared in Huge Enslinn’s book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” as the South Side Fizz. His version called for gin, lemon and lime juices, sugar, mint and club soda. Lose the bubbles and cull one of the citrus fruits, and you get the South Side as we know it today. Multiple accounts peg the South Side’s creation to the 21 Club in New York, a bar that poured countless South Sides throughout the decades. But considering that the first iteration of the famous speakeasy didn’t open until 1922, it’s more likely that the bar popularized the drink rather than invented it. Browse South Side recipes at cocktail bars today, and you will find some drinks made with lemon and others with lime. This citrusy kerfuffle may stem from Enslinn’s recipe containing both juices. It tastes great with lemon or lime, but the 21 Club served theirs with lemon, and so does this recipe. When making the cocktail, treat the mint gently. Too vigorous a thrashing will highlight the herb’s bitter notes rather than its sweet and aromatic qualities.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/singapore-sling/,Singapore Sling,Liquor.com,"The Singapore Sling combines gin, Grand Marnier, cherry liqueur, herbal liqueur (often Benedictine), pineapple, lime, bitters and club soda. It was first created in the early 20th century at Long Bar in the Raffles hotel in Singapore. The original recipe is attributed to Raffles bartender Ngiam Tong Boon and is a variant on the Gin Sling, a type of single-serving punch. The earliest published version of the recipe appeared in “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” a 1930 classic written by Harry Craddock. Subsequent recipes followed, and by 1948, David A. Embury states in his book “ The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks ” that no two published recipes for the Singapore Sling are the same. When constructed with precise measurements, the Singapore Sling is tart, refreshing and delicious. But by the 1980s, as with many tropical classics, the drink had been relegated to a sugary mixture of gin, bottled commercial sweet-and-sour mix and grenadine. Some bars served a bright-red mixture from machines, while others quickly shook up low-quality approximations for tourists. Even the famous Long Bar serves two versions: one derived from a premixed batch that tastes like fruit punch, and another that uses fresh juices and is shaken by hand. Cocktails are subjective, but the latter, handmade version is considered a perfect example of a well-balanced cocktail, and masterclass in how to keep a wide variety of ingredients from overwhelming each other. A Drink I Still Love: The Singapore Sling RELATED ARTICLE At its best, the Singapore Sling is nuanced, complex and ingredient-heavy. It’s also ripe for experimentation. As such, most incarnations of the “classic” cocktail are based on general notes and nostalgia. And many more modern versions result in an overly sweet drink that relies more on grenadine and pineapple juice than herbal liqueurs and fresh citrus.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-last-word/,Last Word,Liquor.com,"The Last Word was first served at the Detroit Athletic Club, circa 1915. Created just before the start of Prohibition, likely by a bartender named Frank Fogarty, it’s one of the cocktail canon’s most successful Prohibition-era drinks. Composed of gin, green Chartreuse , maraschino liqueur and fresh lime juice, the Last Word showed some staying power and appeared in Ted Saucier’s 1951 book, “Bottoms Up.” But by then, it had mostly fallen out of favor, and after World War Two, it retreated to the dusty corners of cocktails past. After decades of being lost to history, the Last Word was one of the first pre-Prohibition drinks to lead the cocktail revival of the early aughts. Murray Stenson, then working at Seattle’s Zig Zag Café, unearthed the equal-parts classic, finding it in Saucier’s book. He shook up the drink for his customers, and the Last Word’s presence proliferated from there. Before long, the Last Word was a staple in cocktail bars across the country, revered for its heady balance of sweet, sour and herbal flavors. The Last Word is about as close to perfect as cocktails can be. But like with many classics, creative bartenders—both of the professional and at-home variety—have found ways to create variations on the Last Word. The Paper Plane , invented by NYC barkeep Sam Ross in 2008, is a liberal take on the original that features bourbon. Other variations hew more closely to the classic recipe, but sub gin for another base spirit. Mezcal makes an earthy, savory version, while rhum agricole produces a fresh and grassy drink. Of course, the first versions were supposedly made with bathtub gin specific to the Detroit Athletic Club, so even London Dry or Old Tom gins technically stray from the original.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/white-lady/,White Lady,Liquor.com,"The White Lady cocktail was invented by famed bartender Harry MacElhone in 1919 while he was working at Ciro’s Club in London. It originally featured crème de menthe, triple sec and lemon in an interesting albeit unusual combination of ingredients. This version enjoyed a decade-long run, but it didn’t last. It wasn’t because of a world war, Prohibition or hard-to-source products: It’s simply because MacElhone changed his creation in 1929, when he was working behind the stick at his own joint, Harry’s New York Bar in Paris. The 1929 recipe, which is still today’s preferred recipe, calls for gin, orange liqueur, lemon juice and egg white. “It’s a dramatic change,” says Brendan Bartley, the beverage director of The 18th Room in New York. It’s unknown exactly why MacElhone made the change, but Bartley confirms that, based on his own taste comparison between the recipes, the newer version is indeed an improvement over the original. This drier, more balanced drink is similar to a classic sour (spirit, citrus, sugar), but swaps liqueur for sugar. Or maybe it’s more like a gin-based Sidecar (brandy, orange liqueur, lemon juice), plus egg white. However you want to think of it, the White Lady is a winner. The gin, liqueur and lemon hit all the right notes, merging bracing botanicals with sweet orange and tart citrus. The egg white smooths any rough edges and yields a rich, silky body. To best incorporate the egg with the liquid components, try “dry-shaking” all the ingredients without ice before shaking again with fresh ice. This initial shake, performed at a higher temperature, helps to emulsify the egg and results in a cohesive, perfectly blended drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bronx/,Bronx,Liquor.com,"The Bronx is an interesting historical cocktail. While it’s not as famous as its two close relatives, the Manhattan or the Martini , it does deserve a place in the cocktail hall of fame along with them, thanks to its unique balance of sweet, tart, botanical and boozy. Like many pre-Prohibition cocktails, the origin of the Bronx is up for debate. However, this debate is less fiery than others, with the generally accepted story attributing its creation to one Johnny Solon (also spelled Solan), a bartender at the famous Astoria-Waldorf Hotel in New York. Reportedly, Solon created the drink sometime in the early 1900s, though an precise date is unknown. According to bartender legend Gary Regan , Solon named it the Bronx after visiting the Bronx Zoo, which opened in 1899. Cocktail historian David Wondrich, in his book “Imbibe,” reports some conflicting origins, including two bartenders in the Bronx itself who have been attributed with the cocktail’s creation. The drink is, essentially, a Perfect Martini (that is, a Martini that uses equal parts sweet and dry vermouth ) with a bit of orange juice and some orange bitters. This particular recipe is perhaps why the drink hasn’t enjoyed the robust legacy of its similar whiskey counterpart also named for a New York City borough. Orange juice is not as popular an ingredient in cocktails as lime, lemon or even grapefruit juice, lacking the intense, concentrated bite of those other citrus fruits. This leads to the Bronx being considered anemic at times, especially compared to the potent elixir of whiskey and vermouth, or the elegance of the Martini’s proportions. According to Wondrich, the Bronx was once criticized in a 1913 play, where a character was referred to as being “as weak as a Bronx Cocktail.” But it has its fans. Unlike the Martini or Manhattan, the addition of orange juice gives this gin drink a refreshing, summertime quality. It also means it’s less out of place at the brunch table than other spirit-forward drinks. For some drinkers the Bronx could replace the Mimosa, at least to mix things up from time to time. The Bronx is a drink that relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients. Using a nice, freshly squeezed orange for juice will result in a brighter, fresher drink than using store-bought orange juice. Likewise, a bottom-shelf gin will make a mediocre version of the Bronx, while citrus-forward gins like Tanqueray No. 10 or Hendrick’s will magnify the bright and quenching aspect of the cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gimlet/,Gimlet,Dylan Garret,"The classic Gimlet cocktail is a three-ingredient masterclass in simplicity and balance. Composed only of gin, lime juice, and sugar, it helped pave the way for countless cocktails to follow, from the Margarita to the Daiquiri and the Sidecar . Over a century later, the Gimlet remains an icon of what's now referred to as the sour category of drinks. It's given rise to variations like the Vodka Gimlet , and its basic template has become so intertwined in cocktail culture that certain drinks, like the Daiquiri, could just as easily be described as a ""Rum Gimlet."" The History of the Gimlet The Gimlet dates to the 19th century. At the time, British sailors had come to be provided lime rations in an effort to combat scurvy. The juice was often mixed with smaller quantities of neutral spirits to preserve it for long voyages, until a a ship provisioner named Lachlan Rose created a technique to fortify the juice with sugar rather than alcohol. Rose's creation allowed for a shelf stable product which he believed would also open an additional market for those seeking preserved lime juice without alcohol included. He would eventually brand his product Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. Understanding the Main Styles of Gin RELATED ARTICLE As for who first combined Rose's cordial with navy rations of gin, the story gets murkier. Many like to credit Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a British naval doctor, for popularizing the cocktail. Others say it was named after a tool used to bore holes on ships. Like most pre-20th-century cocktails, particularly one that come from such a simple a template—spirit, sugar, and citrus—it's hard to pin down a single point of origin. What we do know is that by the 1940–50s, the classic Gimlet was codified in both popular culture and many cocktail books as a simple 50/50 mix of Rose's Lime Juice Cordial and gin. However, much as the Whiskey Sour rebounded from the ""sour mix era"" to once again use fresh ingredients, the Gimlet also began to revert back to what the Rose's version only tried to approximate: a combination of gin, fresh lime juice, and sugar. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog Why the Gimlet Works The Gimlet follows the basic sour template of spirit, citrus, and sugar. This combination features prominently in so many drinks throughout history because of how flexible it is, and how well it works. Sugar and citric acid act on opposite ends of the sweet-to-sour spectrum, and effectively balance each other out. This creates a drink that, when mixed appropriately, is neither sweet nor sour (despite what we call the category), but simply tart and refreshing. Once both side of these two flavor profiles are in sync, the base spirit is able to reflect the best of both worlds, while shining through on its own without being overpowered. Many cite the ""golden ratio"" of sour drinks as 2:1:1—this means two parts of base liquor, one part sweet, and one part sour. This is often used as shorthand, particularly for drink novices, as it will almost guarantee a decent drink across a wide range of ingredients. But part of the reason the style persists is that it's easy, and often preferable, to tweak the balance to individual tastes. Modern tastes tend to favor more spirit-forward combinations, particularly as the quality of distillates around the world has risen dramatically since many of these classic cocktails were first created. With the Gimlet, we've opted for an even balance of simple syrup to lime juice in an effort to capture the original intent of the drink, but slightly reduced the amount of each while increasing the volume of gin, to reflect an era of fresh ingredients and lower-proof gin than those found on British naval vessels.","[{'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, lime juice and simple syrup to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass or an rocks glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",477,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pegu-club-2/,Pegu Club,Alex Frane,"When it comes to the hallmarks of the Golden Age of cocktails, the Pegu Club lacks the notoriety of the other big names like the Sazerac , Mint Julep and Martini . Yet it’s an essential classic, the gin equivalent to sours like the Daiquiri and Margarita , and the drink’s eponymous place of origin even inspired the legendary craft cocktail bar in New York City of the same name. The Pegu Club’s origins date back to the early 20th Century, and to the club of the same name located just outside of Rangoon in what is now called Myanmar. Like many British social clubs in southeast Asia, the Pegu Club was a product of imperialism, a place for British officials to enjoy some libations in their newly colonized territory. Its signature cocktail borrowed the name, at least when it was published in the famed “Savoy Cocktail Book” by Harry Craddock. As for the drink itself, it’s essentially a Gin Sour but without the egg whites and with the addition of bitters. Rather than simple syrup, the Pegu Club takes the Sidecar route and uses triple sec for sweetness and additional citrus notes. Modern recipes sometimes use Cointreau , which certainly works, but others call for orange curaçao. In short, whoever is making the drink should decide for themself with favored orange liqueur to use. Sidecar 651 ratings Adding bitters to a sour isn’t unheard of, but it is a bit unusual. Most of the other big name sours skip them. But the Pegu Club uses a single dash each of Angostura and orange bitters, enough to give the drink complexity without overwhelming the botanicals in the gin or the brightness of the lime juice and orange liqueur. The bitters pair also give the sour a subtle but noticeable flush of color, enhancing the lime juice enough so the drink has a lovely golden hue. Though the Pegu Club shrunk in popularity after Prohibition, it has made a resurgence during the last decade, no doubt partially due to the popularity of the (now-shuttered) New York bar. It’s a worthy inclusion to any list of essential classic drinks, and one that every cocktail fan should try at least once.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange\xa0curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}]","['Add the gin, orange curaçao, lime juice, Angostura bitters and orange bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.']",58,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/french-martini/,French Martini,Liquor.com,"The French Martini helped to kick off the flavored Martini craze of the 1990s. Featuring vodka, pineapple juice and Chambord, the cocktail was first brought to prominence in the late-1980s when it debuted at the famous New York City restaurant Balthazar. The cocktail is emblematic of the era’s preference for fruity and sweet drinks, especially those with Martini in the name or anything appended with a ’Tini suffix (looking at you, Appletini). The reason why this Martini is called a “French” Martini is the inclusion of Chambord black raspberry liqueur , which has been produced in France since the 17th century. The Chambord, along with the pineapple juice, adds rich fruit flavor to the drink. When shaken hard with plenty of ice, the pineapple juice—use the freshest you can find—creates a pleasantly creamy mouthfeel and a frothy head. 11 Martini Variations to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE There are many variations to the French Martini.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/chi-chi-organico/,Chi Chi Organico,Liquor.com,"Unless you’re living somewhere tropical, it can’t always be sunshine, warm weather and beach trips. That’s what the Chi-Chi Organico is for, though. This tropical concoction comes from bartender and brand ambassador H. Joseph Ehrmann, who owns Elixir in San Francisco (reportedly the second-oldest continually operating saloon in the Bay Area), and it’s sure to transport you to some sun-drenched beach no matter what the weather is actually like where you are. Essentially the Chi-Chi is a vodka take on a Piña Colada , with pineapple-infused vodka, pineapple puree, coconut and heavy cream blended with ice. For the vodka, Ehrmann uses Square One Organic , which gets infused with dried pineapple. Another middle-to-high shelf vodka brand can fill in, but if it’s not an organic one, then the cocktail name doesn’t really work. For the coconut, the recipe calls for Coco Lopez cream of coconut, which is notably not the same thing as coconut milk (and definitely not the same as coconut water). Cream of coconut includes sugar and other modifiers and thickeners, and Coco Lopez is its most iconic producer. Ehrmann infuses his organic vodka with a single slice of dried pineapple. The richness of dried pineapple means it quickly and deeply infuses the spirit, and lends it a darker, sweeter flavor than if using fresh pineapple. For the fresh pineapple aspect, the recipe calls for pineapple puree, rather than the more commonly used pineapple juice. Simply cube up some pineapple and throw it into a blender or food processor and pulse until the puree is smooth. Despite the fact that it will end up in a blender with the rest of the drink, it’s still best to puree it ahead of time so it is more evenly incorporated in the final product. As a blended drink, the smaller the ice cubes are, the easier it is to process and the smoother it will be. Larger ice cubes will take longer to break down and will be more uneven and lumpy in the end. Finally, while the drink is traditionally served in a Hurricane or highball glass, serving it in a hollowed-out pineapple and garnishing with some umbrellas and twisty-straws will complete the tropical vibes.","[{'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple-infused Square One Organic vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple purée'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Coco Lopez cream of coconut'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the pineapple-infused vodka, cream of coconut, heavy cream, pineapple puree and Angostura bitters to a blender with 10 ounces of ice and pulse until smooth.', 'Pour into a highball or Hurricane glass.', 'Garnish with a pineapple wedge and serve with a straw.']",0,vodka

She adds a dash of Licor 43, a Spanish liqueur that features a proprietary blend of 43 ingredients, with a viscous mouthfeel and notes of vanilla, citrus and aromatic herbs and spices.

From apple brandy drinks like the Jack Rose or the Calvados Sidecar to modern takes on the Appletini , apples drinks are everywhere once the leaves start to change colors. Less common are drinks that celebrate the other essential fall treat: the noble but humble pear . Pear fans will likely appreciate the Pear Tree Martini, which combines spiced pear vodka, elderflower liqueur, lime juice and bitters for a sweet, bright and floral drink evoking the changing of the season. The drink’s base is Hangar One spiced pear vodka, though these days that spirit can be difficult, if not impossible, to find in most markets. There are some alternatives, though: Wild Roots Vodka from Portland, Oregon, has a lovely pear vodka, though it lacks the spice of Hangar One’s. France’s Grey Goose La Poire and Skyy Vodka’s Bartlett pear-infused vodka from San Francisco are both good replacements, though they similarly lack the spice element that the recipe demands. Absolut has a pear and elderflower vodka , but as the Pear Tree Martini includes elderflower liqueur, it would be redundant and likely too floral. Specifically, the recipe calls for an equal proportion of St-Germain elderflower liqueur. While it’s the most prominent brand of elderflower liqueur—having largely established the style—it does have some competitors. Notably, Giffard and The Bitter Truth each have an elderflower spirit that is comparable in price and quality to St-Germain (though both lack the iconic bottle shape and elaborate design that make St-Germain so recognizable).

Essentially boozy strawberry milk using real strawberries, the drink also includes vanilla vodka, Irish cream and heavy cream, all served in a chocolate Easter bunny—sans ears. An ideal drink to be sipped while the younger generation hunts for Easter eggs. Or, better yet, mix a round of them for friends to accompany an adult Easter egg hunt.

And doing that is definitely the right move. Fresh muddled strawberries add some tartness and juiciness to the mix of vanilla vodka, Irish cream and heavy cream. Bailey’s Irish Cream is the most widely known and available Irish cream liqueur, but other brands have entered the market as well. For instance, Merrys offers a few different flavors of Irish cream, including a strawberry one to really amplify the strawberry flavors in the Easter Bunny Shot. And Carolans has been around since the late ’70s, with its traditional Irish cream flavor. If you want to go wild for Easter, you can always play around with making your own Irish cream . Even if you only assemble a few Easter Bunny shots, you can use the rest of that homemade Irish cream for Mudslides or an Irish Affogato . Or you can use it to bake desserts to go along with the Easter Bunny Shot. It’s difficult to make this drink properly any time of the year other than Easter season, when chocolate rabbits are available in every grocery store.

At the time, the drink was absent from local cocktail menus, but today, it’s nearly as prevalent as other New Orleans classics like the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz . When introducing the cocktail back to the city, Hannah adjusted the recipe for modern palates, as the original drink skewed tart. Today’s barkeeps have mostly followed suit, including veteran New Orleans bartender Daniel Victory, who provided this particular recipe. The cocktail features brandy, dry curaçao, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, simple syrup and Angostura bitters with a sugar rim and lemon twist garnish. Don’t skip that rim—it not only tastes good, but is an important key to making a Crusta, well, a Crusta. 7 Mardis Gras Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange\xa0curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sugar rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rim a coupe glass with sugar and set aside.', 'Add the brandy, orange curaçao, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, simple syrup, and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",65,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/side-by-sidecar/,Side by Sidecar,Liquor.com,"The century-old Sidecar is likely the most famous of cognac drinks, a simple yet elegant combination of brandy, orange liqueur and lemon juice—essentially a cognac sour. Created sometime around the first World War and named for the attached car of a motorcycle, it has seen innumerable variations over the years. Many, like the Calvados Sidecar or Pear Brandy Sidecar , are as simple as swapping out the base spirit for another kind of brandy, and perhaps tweaking the proportions a bit. But the Side by Sidecar from bartending veteran Eben Freeman goes further, and splits the base between the obligatory cognac and a pomegranate liqueur. Calvados Sidecar 42 ratings Freeman doesn’t specify which cognac label or triple sec to use in the Side by Sidecar, but Cointreau for the orange liqueur is always a good bet. For cognac, it’s best to use a bottle that is affordable but high-quality, and to save the pricey stuff for drinking on its own. However, Freeman is particular about the pomegranate liqueur: Pama Pomegranate. There are a few alternatives on the market, including one from Alize, but Pama is the most readily available in most markets. Tart, sweet and a touchy boozy, it adds a juicy red touch to the vaunted classic. When it comes to the sugared rim, it’s advisable to cover only half. That way, you and your guests can choose how much sugar to have with each sip. It’s best not to skip the sugar entirely, as the pomegranate liqueur and lemon juice create a tart sidecar.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/princess-marys-pride/,Princess Mary’s Pride,Liquor.com,"The year was 1922. Princess Mary of the British royal family was set to marry Henry George Charles Lascelles, the sixth Earl of Harewood. Naturally, a proper cocktail was required to commemorate the occasion. Legendary bartender and author Harry Craddock knew just the one. Craddock made the Princess Mary’s Pride in 1922, later immortalizing it in the 1930 edition of “ The Savoy Cocktail Book .” He mixed together Calvados (a French apple brandy ), Dubonnet rouge (a French wine-based aperitif) and dry vermouth. It’s a variation on the Perfect Manhattan , which calls for whiskey, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth and aromatic bitters. In this case, the Calvados takes the place of whiskey, and Dubonnet rouge subs in for the sweet vermouth, creating a drink that is fruit-forward and floral. Craddock’s original recipe curiously instructs for this cocktail to be shaken, bucking the convention to stir drinks that are made with all spirits and do not contain any juice or creamy elements. Craddock is one of the most famous bartenders of all time and is responsible for one of the industry’s most important tomes. So, maybe he had a reason for shaking this drink, or perhaps it was merely an oversight. Either way, bartending veteran and brand ambassador Charlotte Voisey, who shared this recipe, follows the typical rules (and modern practice) that suggests stirring the cocktail with ice before straining it into a cocktail glass. This creates a smooth and silky drink that is free of any unnecessary ice shards.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/forbidden-fruit/,Forbidden Fruit,Liquor.com,"Whenever the temperatures drop, it’s time to put away the Mojitos and spritzes and reach for drinks that complement cooler nights. Any spirit can be incorporated into a tasty fall cocktail, but certain bottles, like whiskey, dark rum and brandy, shine better than others. The Forbidden Fruit by bartending vet Aisha Sharpe combines apple brandy, Pimm’s No. 1, fresh lemon juice, a touch of simple syrup, and bitters, and is then topped with spicy ginger beer. It’s the equivalent of autumn in a glass but is still light and bright enough to whet your appetite for the season’s biggest meals. Sharpe begins with Laird’s straight bottled-in-bond apple brandy, a 100-proof spirit made in New Jersey at the oldest licensed distillery in the U.S. Distilled entirely from apples, the rich and golden spirit is versatile in cocktails, with plenty of proof and distinct apple flavors. Pimm’s No. 1 is a gin-based liqueur that was created in the 1800s by a London bar owner named James Pimm. It is most closely associated with the Pimm’s Cup , a refreshing cocktail that combines the liqueur with ginger ale, lemon juice and a medley of garnishes, including cucumber, strawberry and mint. In this case, Pimm’s No. 1 joins the apple brandy to create a bold and complex base. Fresh lemon juice and simple syrup are a classic combination employed in countless drinks, providing citrus, sweetness and balance. From there, two kinds of bitters lend complexity, structure and aromatics. Angostura bitters have a bouquet of fruits, spices and herbs, while bright-red Peychaud’s bitters add some color alongside flavors of gentian and anise. The next step is to top the shaken and strained concoction with ginger beer . This brewed beverage is a centuries-old drink that features a strong ginger flavor and spicy kick. It’s noticeably different than ginger ale, which is essentially ginger-flavored soda. Choose ginger beer for the best and most flavorful result.

The recipe is an original creation by Duggan McDonnell, a San Francisco bartender and the author of “ Drinking the Devil’s Acre: A Love Letter from San Francisco and Her Cocktails .” The Intercontinental takes you around the world—well, specifically to Europe—with ingredients native to France, Italy and Croatia. Those include Armagnac (a distinctive brandy produced in southwest France), Averna (an herbal, bittersweet amaro from Sicily) and maraschino, a clear, bittersweet liqueur made from Marasca cherries that originated along the Dalmatian coast. Maraschino is a key component in cocktails like the Aviation and Hemingway Daiquiri , and because it’s made with both the flesh and pits of the cherries, it also features a mild nutty flavor that’s akin to almonds. That European trio conspires to create a drink rich with dry fruit flavors and a touch of gentle, herbal bitterness, while the simple lemon twist garnish provides a hint of fresh, zesty citrus.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coffee-cocktail/,Coffee Cocktail,Liquor.com,"The Coffee Cocktail is a classic concoction, developed sometime in the late 19th Century. Today, its recipe tends to be adapted from its first published iteration in the famed “Jerry Thomas’s Guide to Bartending” from the grandfather of modern bartending. While recipes may slightly differ from source to source, one thing is consistent—despite the name, this historic drink contains no coffee or caffeine of any sort. The name likely comes from the fact that once the drink is shaken and served, it looks a bit like a coffee drink with lots of foamy milk. That’s the conclusion that Thomas came to in his book, at least, writing that while it had no coffee and no bitters (the latter of which was required for a cocktail at the time), it looked like coffee when “properly concocted.” Instead, it’s closest to a Brandy Flip, a historic drink category that uses a whole egg rather than only the whites, like many sours do. Discover the Flip with These 8 Recipes RELATED ARTICLE Cognac is the base of the Coffee Cocktail, but it also gets an equal amount of ruby port, which is brighter than most ports with a fruity sweetness. There are plenty of brands of each on the market, so use whatever fits best in your bar for drinks like the Sidecar . Simple syrup sweetens the drink, and the whole egg gives it a rich, creamy mouthfeel. It’s important to properly shake the cocktail, preferably with a dry shake first (no ice) before adding the ice to really agitate and foam it. You’ll know you’ve done it right if it looks like a foamy coffee drink when poured into a port glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/calvados-sidecar/,Calvados Sidecar,Liquor.com,"The Sidecar is a classic cocktail featuring cognac, orange liqueur and lemon juice that is traditionally served with a sugar rim. First cobbled together around World War 1, it has remained a favorite drink for more than a century. Though it calls specifically for cognac, bartenders and enthusiasts alike have long experimented with the recipe by tweaking its base spirit. The Calvados Sidecar comes from Dushan Zaric and Jason Kosmas of Employees Only, an acclaimed cocktail bar that started in New York and has since opened locations in Los Angeles, Miami and overseas. The drink is precisely what it sounds like: a Sidecar made with Calvados, the apple brandy produced in a protected region of Normandy, France. This departure from grape-based cognac, also made in France, yields a different flavor from the original but still produces a drink that is recognizable as a Sidecar. The cocktail is made with Boulard Hors d’Âge Calvados. “Hors d’Age” denotes a Calvados that is at least six years old, but it can be older. In this case, Boulard’s expression has been matured between 10 and 20 years, producing a rich and full-bodied spirit with notes of dried fruits and tannic oak. The Calvados merges with Cointreau, an orange liqueur that is made with sweet and bitter orange peels macerated in neutral alcohol, plus fresh-squeezed lemon juice.

Its most famous interpretation is likely the Sidecar , made with cognac, orange liqueur and lemon juice, but many variations have spun out from the original model—the Last Resort is one such variation. The drink comes from the celebrated bartender Dushan Zarić—co-founder of New York City’s Employees Only —and it sees a few key changes to the Brandy Sour blueprint, including switching the base spirit for pear brandy and adding an absinthe rinse. For the base of the drink, Zarić uses a pear eau-de-vie , also know as Poire Williams for the pear that it is made from. Colorless but deeply aromatic and fruity, the fruit brandy evokes ripe, fresh pears. In particular, Zarić uses Massenez Poire Williams, a lauded and elegant spirit from France. While it is an exceptional spirit, it has its competitors. In the United States, Oregon’s Clear Creek pear brandy is highly regarded and made with Bartlett pears, as the Williams pear is known in the U.S. To the south, St. George Spirits in California makes another beautiful pear eau-de-vie. Eastern Europe, too, produces a number of pear eaux-de-vie, though those can be difficult to source outside of their home countries. This bright and vivid drink sees the pear brandy shaken with lemon and rich simple syrup that accentuate the floral and fruity notes of the pear brandy, as well as egg white for a frothy, silky mouthfeel. It also gets a rinse of absinthe, which lends botanicals and herbaceous aromatics. It’s finished with a dusting of nutmeg, which complements the pear, as well as a few drops of Peychaud’s bitters that rest upon the pillowy foam.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jack-rose/,Jack Rose,Liquor.com,"The Jack Rose cocktail was created around the turn of the 20th century. Its origin is ambiguous, but reports peg its creation to either New York or New Jersey, which tracks considering the drink’s base spirit was likely Laird’s Applejack, an apple brandy made in New Jersey at the oldest licensed distillery in the U.S. The drink quickly found fans and enjoyed a popular run through Prohibition and even among prominent authors—it was a known favorite of John Steinbeck and made an appearance in Hemingway’s 1926 book “The Sun Also Rises.” It was also included as one of six basic drinks to know in David Embury’s 1948 book “The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks.” Taking its name from its main ingredient and its rosy color, the Jack Rose is composed of applejack (or apple brandy), lemon juice and grenadine. Before 1968, applejack was synonymous with apple brandy . It was only when consumer preferences started moving towards lighter products like vodka and gin that applejack’s distinct identity took shape. The Lairds worked with the government to establish a new federal standard for blended apple brandy, and as a result, applejack is now defined as a blend of at least 20% apple distillate with neutral grain spirit that must be aged at least two years in oak. Applejack has a mellower flavor than straight apple brandy. Laird’s is still the go-to, but today there are several distilleries—particularly in the northeastern United States—that are producing applejacks and American apple brandies. Applejack provides a subtly fruity base to the Jack Rose that merges effortlessly with the lemon and grenadine. Good grenadine is essential when making the cocktail, as it’s the only source of sweetness to balance the liquor and citrus.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/le-sang-et-sable/,Le Sang et Sable,Liquor.com,"The Blood & Sand is a classic, but it’s an odd one. Its base is scotch whisky, rather than the more commonplace bourbon or rye, and instead of lemon or lime juice it takes orange juice, and it’s sweetened with cherry liqueur rather than a sugar syrup. Le Sang et Sable is a French variation on the classic, and comes from bar legend and father of the Cosmopolitan , Toby Cecchini. It tweaks most of the ingredients, swapping a few of them out for French products to match the French translation of the name, and adding a few others. The History and Secrets of the Cosmopolitan RELATED ARTICLE For starters, Le Sang et Sable uses brandy as its base, rather than scotch. As with any good French brandy drink, that means cognac—H by Hine cognac to be precise. You can substitute with another French brandy if need be, though the H by Hine offers a quality product at a very decent price range, especially for cognac. Rather than the more traditional Italian red vermouth that you would find in a Blood & Sand, Cecchini stick with French, using Dubonnet rouge aperitif. This fortified French wine is similar to vermouth, but also has the bitterness of quinine, along with other herbs and spices. Cherry Heering, the Danish cherry liqueur, sticks around in this Blood & Sand variation. Like always, if you substitute with another cherry liqueur you’ll want to test for sweetness before serving, as Heering tends to be on the sweeter side compared to others. Finally, rather than the traditional freshly squeezed orange juice, Le Sang et Sable calls for equal parts lemon juice and blood orange juice—the latter adds a beautiful ruby touch to the already crimson drink, but can be hard to find outside of the winter months when it’s in season.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'H by Hine cognac'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dubonnet rouge aperitif'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cherry Heering'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blood orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cocktail cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the cognac, Dubonnet rouge aperitif, Cherry Heering, blood orange juice and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake vigorously until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into two chilled stemmed cordial glasses or Nick & Noras.', 'Garnish with a cocktail cherry and a lemon twist.']",0,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jane-russell/,Jane Russell,Liquor.com,"Rye whiskey’s roots in the United States trace back to the 17th century, when the spirit began to be distilled in colonies including Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts. Composed of at least 51% rye grains, this whiskey is characterized by its spicy profile and is a popular addition to several classic cocktails, namely the Manhattan and Old Fashioned . It’s also a great choice for classic variations, like the Jane Russell, a Manhattan riff from veteran New York bartender Brian Miller. Miller is best known for his Tiki drinks and pirate aesthetic, but he cut his teeth at some of New York’s best bars, including Death and Co. and Pouring Ribbons. Naturally, he knows his way around cocktails. To make the Jane Russell, he enlists two rye whiskeys , plus sweet vermouth, Benedictine, Grand Marnier and bitters. The rye and vermouth combination start this drink off with strong Manhattan vibes, but Miller gets the most from the constituent parts by choosing two different ryes. Russell’s Reserve is six years old and bottled at 90 proof, and it combines oaky sweetness with a hint of vanilla. Rittenhouse is four years old and 100 proof with a distinctly spicy flavor that includes notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and maple. For the vermouth, Miller opts for a small dose of Carpano Antica Formula, which is rich and warming, with notes of vanilla, spices and wild herbs. The recipe takes a turn from traditional Manhattans with the addition of Benedictine and Grand Marnier . The former is a French liqueur made from a secret blend of 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon, fir cones and juniper. The latter is a cognac-based orange liqueur that imbues drinks with bright citrus, bitter orange, vanilla and a nutty nuance. Together, these modifiers merge with the whiskeys and vermouth to add extra flavor and complexity to the cocktail. Finally, Miller calls on one dash of Bittermens xocolatl mole bitters, which feature cacao, cinnamon and spice and are modeled after the classic mole sauces of Mexico. The Jane Russell isn’t a classic Manhattan, but it’s a recognizable variation that provides plenty to taste and talk about. 20 Rye Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Grand Marnier'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Russell’s Reserve rye, Rittenhouse rye, Benedictine, Carpano Antica Formula vermouth, Grand Marnier and mole bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe or cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",22,rye
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/thistle/,Thistle,Liquor.com,"While amari are sometimes used as a cocktail ingredient, they’re often included as a way to bolster or highlight a base spirit, especially darker ones like whiskey or brandy. However, in the Thistle—a cold weather cocktail from Chicago bartender Paul McGee, forner co-owner of the now-shuttered Tiki bar Lost Lake—the amaro takes center stage, and is paired with rye whiskey and calvados, a French apple brandy . The amaro McGee uses also gives the drink its name: Cardamaro is a wine-based Italian digestif flavored with blessed thistle and cardoon. Though an amaro, it shares many similarities with vermouth, and has a less-pronounced bitterness than many other amari. Its gentle botanical quality means it won’t overwhelm a drink, even when using 1 1/2 ounces of it. Cardamaro’s spice and nuttiness are perfect complements to the fresh apple flavor of the calvados and warming spice of the rye whiskey. While it won’t be an exact match for calvados, another apple brandy—such as Laird’s from New Jersey or Clear Creek from Oregon—could stand in, if that’s what you have on hand. For the rye, whichever brand you best prefer in your Manhattan or Boulevardier will very likely work well here, too. Additionally, the drink gets a half ounce of Pedro Ximénez sherry. This fortified wine is richer and sweeter than many other styles of sherry, and is responsible for the majority of the drink’s sweetness. A few dashes of Angostura bitters ups the complexity and depth of the drink, as well as adds some additional botanicals, while a small splash of lemon juice lends brightness and acidity. While the general rule is to always shake a cocktail with citrus juice in it, the minor amount of lemon and everything else being a dark spirit means you should treat the Thistle like any other spirits-based drink and stir it.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cardamaro amaro'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Calvados'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Pedro Ximénez sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}]","['Add the Cardamaro, calvados, rye whiskey, sherry, lemon juice and Angostura bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a footed glass.']",0,whiskey

While it’s generally found as a cloying cocktail made with artificial flavors, there have been many attempts to improve on the basic idea. But bar veteran Aisha Sharpe took a different approach with her version, and the Apple Fool’s Martini is akin to fool’s gold—just like how the gold-hued metal has no actual gold in it, this light green concoction lacks any actual apple. But its color, crisp flavors and gentle fruitiness bely that fact, and can potentially fool a drinker if they don’t know any better. The Apple Fool’s Martini gets some of its signature verdant hue from basil muddled with simple syrup. These peppery leaves also give the drink a brightness and slight vegetal quality that lingers with each sip. To build on that, the base spirit is a blanco tequila; Sharpe used Don Julio for the recipe, but any good quality un-aged tequila should do the trick. To add even more green color, and to up the savory herbaceous qualities of the drink, it gets a half ounce of Green Chartreuse —this deeply botanical spirit is also a key ingredient in classics like the Last Word and the Bijou . If you want to splurge on a bottle for the Apple Fool’s Martini, you’ll have plenty of opportunities to use it elsewhere. For acid and a touch of sweetness, the drink gets both lime juice and ruby red grapefruit juice. Of course, if you use a paler grapefruit, like a yellow one, the drink will be a more green and less reddish, which harkens to its name. In any case, it leads to a drink that, while perhaps dishonestly named, is reminiscent of, and improves on, the Appletini.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/colletti-royale/,Colletti Royale,Alex Frane,"While the Margarita is already a pretty flawless drink, there are few things that cannot be improved by the addition of Champagne, especially rosé Champagne. Enter the Colletti Royale, a spritzy, boozy cocktail from bartender Julie Reiner, co-owner of the celebrated cocktail bars Clover Club , Leyenda , and Milady's in New York City. This vivid orange spritzer gets its striking color from blood oranges and rosé Champagne. The tart juice blends lovingly with tequila, and is further enhanced by the brandy-based orange liqueur Cointreau , as well as two dashes of orange bitters. St-Germain , an elderflower liqueur, adds sweetness and floral notes, amplifying the drink’s complexity and depth; some lime juice helps balance the acidity and sweetness. The Best Tequila Cocktails to Try Now FEATURED IN When it comes to the sparkling wine that tops the drink and provides its requisite burst of spritz, there are some options. The best, and the one that Reiner goes with for the drink, is a rosé Champagne. Generally on the dry side and with plenty of berry notes and an aroma of baked brioche, it’s nearly impossible to find a perfect substitute for a pink Champagne. However, there are some reasonably close alternatives. Cremant sparkling wines are available in regions across France. Made in the same manner as Champagne, but often with different grape varieties, wines like Cremant d’Alsace, Cremant de Bourgogne, and Cremant de Loire are lovely replacements. And while they don’t carry the name of the famous wine region, they do generally carry a lower price tag for a similar quality sparkling rosé. Likewise, the United States is producing some quality sparkling rosé, with states like Washington, Oregon, California, New Mexico, New York, and even Texas getting in on the action. Just be sure to avoid any bottles that are too sweet or it will throw off the balance of the drink.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'reposado tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blood orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Rosé Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'blood orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, Cointreau, St-Germain, blood orange juice, lime juice and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a wine glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with the rosé Champagne.', 'Garnish with a blood orange wheel.']",66,tequila

This simple riff on the classic Margarita from bartender Gabe Sanchez of Midnight Rambler in Dallas, combines these two ingredients to create a grassy, citrusy punch that helps give a new twist to an old classic. “[It] feels like sitting on the beach under the bright sun with a cool breeze,” says Sanchez. Fresh watermelon juice is key to creating the ideal Watermelon Margarita, but if you don't have a juicer on hand, store-bought options can work as well. Just look for 100% watermelon juice without added sugar, water, or artificial flavorings.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sparkling-rose/,Sparkling Rose,Linnea Covington,"Tequila and other agave spirits can sometimes overpower more delicate flavors in a cocktail, but in this pink drink created by Jaime Salas for Milagro tequila , the base spirit is just one layer of many. At first, you’ll get that unmistakable wave of roasted agave before the fresh watermelon juice hits, carried by the bubbles of crisp, dry sparkling rosé. The aptly-named Sparkling Rose is versatile enough to crowd-please at a summer barbecue or brighten up date night by the fire on a cold winter’s eve thanks to its approachable-yet-unique flavor profile and perennially easy-to-find ingredients. If we’re getting granular, this cocktail is essentially a tequila French 75 —it’s hard to go wrong with a template as universally-beloved as this one, and given that the French 75 works just as well with gin as it does its (alleged) original cognac base, swapping in another spirit like tequila isn’t as much of a gamble as one might think. The Sparkling Rose recipe is also incredibly easy to scale up if you’re hosting a crowd (just be sure to add the sparkling wine as close to serving time as possible so as to preserve the integrity of the bubbles). While Salas naturally used Milagro in his recipe, there are plenty of silver tequilas that could work well in this drink when making a round or two at home. Simply use your go-to, or take it as a challenge to see which brand works best from one cocktail to the next. Bartending is both an art and a science, so never be afraid to experiment, as long as you’re doing so safely, of course—by this we mean don’t try lighting things on fire or sabering a bottle of bubbles after drinking multiple cocktails (do these things beforehand instead).

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tequila-martini/,Tequila Martini,Liquor.com,"There was a time, roughly sandwiched between the 1980s and early 2000s, when anything served in a stemmed glass was called a Martini. Bartenders created all manner of drinks under this umbrella, from modern-classics like the Espresso Martini and Appletini to lesser cocktails that fell by the wayside. Most had nothing in common with the classic cocktail (gin, dry vermouth, maybe a dash or two of bitters), save for the vessel in which it was served. The Tequila Martini is the unique variation that goes in a new direction while paying homage to the original. This recipe comes from blogger and recipe developer Matt Armato and features blanco tequila, blanc vermouth, lemon juice and orange bitters. The unaged tequila puts earthy agave notes front and center, while the blanc vermouth—which is sweeter and more floral than dry vermouth—provides that kick of aromatized wine you want in a Martini . The scant quarter ounce of lemon juice, clearly a sharp turn from the classic all-spirits drink, adds a touch of acid and balance, while the orange bitters bring additional structure and citrus. All those ingredients are shaken together, which isn’t a Bond-like faux pas, but rather the proper technique for any cocktail containing juice. Sure, the Tequila Martini is a far cry from the gin-based original. But this punchy version provides its own charms without straying so far from the classic formula to render it unrecognizable.

He sought to create a light, refreshing brunch drink that could also be enjoyed at any time of day. “Lower proof, bubbly, pink, and delicious,” says Morgenthaler, describing the drink. How to Make a Classic French 75 RELATED ARTICLE The Lone Ranger is a twist on the classic French 75 , perhaps the most well-known example of a sparkling wine cocktail. The formula remains mostly the same, but Morgenthaler employs tequila in place of gin, and sparkling rosé adds a fresh undercurrent of fruit.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cosmo-rita/,Cosmo Rita,Liquor.com,"Classic and modern-classic cocktails rarely need to be tweaked. Often, these drinks stand the test of time for a reason: They’re delicious, well-balanced and memorable. But despite their many merits, bartenders and enthusiasts regularly create their own riffs on popular cocktails, whether it’s swapping the base spirit in a Negroni or using amaro in place of sweet vermouth in a Manhattan . The Cosmopolitan is not immune from this treatment, as witnessed by this Cosmo Rita recipe from bartender Armando Zapata, which swaps the vodka out in favor of tequila. The classic Cosmo recipe calls for citrus vodka, Cointreau , lime juice and cranberry juice cocktail, which is basically just sweetened cranberry juice. Created in the 1980s, the pink-hued Cosmo was a popular order, but it reached its peak in the late-1990s and early-2000s, coinciding with HBO’s hit show “Sex and the City,” where the cocktail was heavily featured as a favorite of the characters. For a time, it may have been the most popular cocktail in America. Since then, the Cosmo has taken a tumultuous ride, still beloved by many drinkers but reviled by certain bartenders, who tired of making the drink. Regardless, you can’t deny its staying power. If you want to branch out from the classic recipe, the Cosmo Rita features tequila, triple sec, cranberry juice and fresh lime juice. It’s a recognizable riff, but tequila’s earthy, vegetal profile is much different than vodka’s more neutral flavor, so the spirit stands up taller in the drink. This recipe also changes the classic ratios, decreasing the orange liqueur and lime juice, and doubling the cranberry juice from a half ounce to a full ounce. This tames the alcohol slightly, while giving the drink a more pronounced cranberry flavor. 6 Things You Should Know About the Cosmopolitan RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'triple sec'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cranberry juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, triple sec, cranberry juice and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass or coupe.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",6,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/trato-hecho/,Mezcal Last Word,Audrey Morgan,"A classic pre-Prohibition cocktail, the Last Word saw a dramatic decline in popularity post-World War II, but its ubiquity was restored in the early days of the craft cocktail revival. Seattle bartender Murray Stenson famously discovered the drink in Ted Saucier’s 1951 book, Bottoms Up , and it quickly became a hit at his bar Zig Zag Café. Today, the Last Word is a drink with a strong fanbase—one of its appeals is its versatility, as bartenders substitute its primary spirit, gin, with other ingredients. A popular swap is mezcal, which works surprisingly well and offers a dramatically different flavor profile. Last Word 443 ratings On paper, the Mezcal Last Word is an odd drink, mixing smoky and earthy mezcal, highly botanical Green Chartreuse , syrupy-sweet maraschino liqueur, and tart lime juice, all in equal parts. But when they come together, the balance and depth is remarkable.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ile-rouge/,Ile Rouge,Liquor.com,"The Ile Rouge (which in French means Red Island), is a spicy and sweet drink made with tequila, peppercorns, grapefruit juice and vanilla liqueur. Developed by drinks consultant Aisha Sharpe , the cocktail is an exercise in balance. Vanilla and tequila marry well together, as do tequila and grapefruit , and heat is a popular element in drinks made with agave liquors. While it’s unusual to see all four elements sharing a glass, it works well, as the crispness of the citrus and earthiness of tequila balance the rich sweetness of the vanilla liqueur, which in turn tempers the heat from the crushed peppercorns. For tequila and, somewhat less so, for vanilla liqueur there are plenty of options to choose from. A blanco tequila or reposado are the best in regards to age, as the richness and smokiness of an añejo can overwhelm the other ingredients—plus, its darker hue will make the red of the drink less vivid. And, of course, a low-quality tequila means a low-quality cocktail, so it’s wise to go with a mid-shelf brand, at least. For the vanilla liqueur, Giffard‘s Vanille De Madagascar Liqueur is a solid choice, but others on the market can work. With any shaken cocktail, it’s best to double strain the Ile Rouge: In addition to the strainer built into a three-piece shaker or a Julep or Hawthorne strainer that goes over the mouth of a shaker tin, using a small kitchen strainer will help catch all the shards of ice and any juice pulp, and keep your shaken drink clean and pretty. But with this drink it’s especially important, as it will catch the shells of the crushed peppercorns, keeping them from adding bitterness or, worse, crunch to your otherwise pristine cocktail. Finally, the drink is garnished with an “island” of pink peppercorns, from which it derives its name. It takes a steady hand but if they’re each carefully dropped in, they should float together to create the eponymous red island. As elegant as it is, try to avoid swallowing them whole when enjoying the final product.","[{'quantity': '15', 'unit': 'tsp, whole', 'ingredient': 'pink peppercorns'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vanilla liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ruby red grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tsp, whole', 'ingredient': 'pink peppercorns'}]","['Muddle the peppercorns in a shaker.', 'Add the vanilla liqueur, tequila, grapefruit juice and lemon juice to the shaker and fill with ice.', 'Shake and double-strain into a chilled Martini glass.', 'Garnish with a few more peppercorns, floating them on the surface like a peppery island.']",0,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hearts-of-pom/,Hearts of Pom,Liquor.com,"The pomegranate is a historic fruit, name-dropped in the Bible and Greek mythology. Sweet, tart and bright-red, the thick-skinned fruit is a delicious treat, whether you eat the arils (the edible seeds) you find inside or juice them. But don’t forget the pomegranate’s application in cocktails. Its unique flavor works with a variety of liquors and during all seasons, sprucing up wintry whiskey drinks, summery gin drinks and everything between. The Hearts of Pom is a simple variation on the classic Margarita that adds pomegranate juice to the holy trinity of tequila, orange liqueur and lime. Extract that juice straight from the raw fruit for an extra-fresh dose of pomegranate, or you can purchase a high-quality bottled version and achieve good results. The drink calls for Riazul plata tequila, an expression that is made in the highlands of Jalisco and aged for a quick 15 days in neutral oak barrels. Rather than adding oak’s hallmark notes of vanilla, caramel and spice to the liquor, the barrels round out the tequila’s fresh agave character and earthy accents. Cointreau and lime juice merge to create sweet, tart balance, while the pomegranate juice brings its own mix of sweet, tart flavors. The result is a refreshing, juicy cocktail that takes on the pomegranate’s red hue and rich taste without sacrificing its credibility as a quasi-Margarita.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ocean-mist/,Ocean Mist,Alex Frane,"There are more than a few drinks that pay homage to the sea: the Sea Breeze and its spin-off, the Cape Codder , are two. But usually the theme is nebulous. The Cape Codder, essentially a Vodka Cranberry, is a reference to the cranberry bogs of Cape Cod in Massachusetts, while the Sea Breeze is just generally refreshing. One could see some connection between the sweet-tart vodka drink and a cool ocean breeze, but that’s being generous. The Ocean Mist, on the other hand, is far more evocative of its namesake thanks to a clever use of blue curaçao—a sapphire-hued orange liqueur—and the frothiness of egg whites. Cape Codder 143 ratings Bartender Kevin Mabry developed the Ocean Mist for the now-closed Boston restaurant Merrill & Co. The cocktail begins with a silver tequila (Mabry uses Milagro, a decently priced premium brand), and also has apricot brandy for extra oomph and richness, as well as sweetness. Mabry uses Rothman & Winter—it’s by far the easiest apricot brandy to come by, and a high-quality spirit, but if you happen to have another bottle on hand, feel free to use it. The liquors are shaken with lemon juice, egg white and, importantly, a bit of Maldon sea salt. This won’t make the drink overtly salty, but rather enhances the other ingredients and provides a subtle nuance of saltiness that suits the name. After shaking, the drink is poured over a half-ounce of blue curaçao, a crucial step that gives the Ocean Mist its stunning visuals. The cocktail transitions from blue to aqua to sea foam green, with a crest of white foam—an homage to the New England coast. Blue curaçao is an artificially colored orange liqueur made from curaçao oranges; the most well-known producer is DuKupyer, though it can be considered overly sweet or cloying. One trick to really punch up the Ocean Mist—as well as any other blue-hued drinks like the Corpse Reviver No. Blue or the Blue Lagoon —is to make your own blue curaçao. It takes some time (20 days, actually) and labor, but the next time you make a round of Ocean Mists (or Adios, Motherfuckers ), your tastebuds will know the difference.

Baker created this riff on an Espresso Martini , calling it “a much smoother version of an Espresso Martini that has more layers of flavor.” “I really don't enjoy the bitterness you get from espresso, or even coffee for that matter,” says Baker. “With this recipe, I can control the level of bitterness in the cocktail.” He swaps out bitter espresso for flavorful cold-brew coffee and the typical Kahlúa for more intense cold-brew liqueur and adds vanilla extract and chocolate bitters instead of relying on those notes from the brew. Agave spirits form the drink’s base rather than the usual vodka, and agave nectar takes the place of simple syrup . The unexpected addition of firewater bitters throws the drink’s flavors in an entirely new direction, while the final touch is edible glitter in the colors of the pan-African flag. “In the end, you'll have a smoother full-bodied Espresso Martini-esque cocktail with just hints of smoke, bitterness, chocolate, vanilla and spice” says Baker. Baker admits the result of swapping most of the cocktail’s typical ingredients may throw some people off. “Because this cocktail doesn't have the typical ingredients of an Espresso Martini, people will probably take a look at this recipe and think it's going to be terrible,” he says. “But that's what I find so fun about creating cocktails: putting unusual ingredients together and making believers out of people.” As for the drink’s name, Baker says it reflects him expressing himself through a cocktail, taking a standard and making it his own through the use of unexpected components. “I'm really excited for people to taste it, become a believer and consequently get inspired to step outside of the box and try something new,” he says. “Rather than following the typical cookie-cutter method of creating cocktails, I want them to be inspired to step outside of their comfort zone and imagine what kind of cocktail they would like to create and make it come to life.” Espresso Martini 1348 ratings","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cold-brew coffee liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cold-brew coffee'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'vanilla extract'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Hella Mexican chocolate bitters'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Scrappy’s Firewater bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'black, green and red edible glitter', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, coffee liqueur, mezcal, cold-brew coffee, agave nectar, vanilla extract, chocolate bitters and Firewater bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe glass.', 'Garnish with black, green and red edible glitter.']",22,tequila

Traditionally composed of a spirit, sugar and hot water, often with citrus or spices, there are nearly as many ways to make the toddy as people who make them. But one bartender has a method you may want to adopt as your own. Portland, Oregon’s Jeffrey Morgenthaler has worked behind the stick at some of the best bars in the city. He’s known for his updated take on the Amaretto Sour and a DIY grenadine that vastly improves on the versions found on store shelves. He’s also no slouch when it comes to the Hot Toddy. Morgenthaler’s Hot Toddy employs the bain-marie approach, which utilizes a mixing tin filled with hot water to heat another mixing tin containing the cocktail. It’s a sort of double-boiler concept, with one tin nestled inside the other, to warm the spirits so they release their aromatics. In this case, the spirit is bourbon and it’s joined by allspice dram, lemon juice and house-made ginger syrup. Once everything is heated up, pour it into a mug and top with a little hot water before sipping the comforting elixir. “I had been served so many warm or lukewarm toddies that I was looking for a way to drink the whole drink hot,” says Morgenthaler. “A splash of hot water alone doesn’t result in a hot drink.

During winter, the best cocktails have one more helpful attribute: They’re hot. Warm drinks like the Hot Toddy (spirit, sugar and hot water) and Mulled Wine (red wine with various mulling spices) reduce the cold-weather chill one toasty sip at a time. The same applies to the Francophile, a Mulled Wine variation from Alex Day of Proprietors LLC , the group behind a fleet of bars in New York and Los Angeles, including Death & Co. His drink features the French brandy Calvados, plus Rioja wine, cinnamon simple syrup, fresh lemon juice and water. Calvados gives the drink a rich backbone of apple and oak that merges seamlessly with the red Spanish wine and its hallmark notes of dark berries, plums and herbs. If you can’t find Rioja, aim for a medium-to-full-bodied wine with plenty of tannins and some acidity. Avoid bottlings that are too light, as those wines will get lost in the drink. Cinnamon syrup, which can be quickly made at home with sugar, water, and cinnamon sticks, acts as your sweetener, and lemon juice provides a hint of citrus and balance. Those four strong flavors are tempered with water, which adds necessary dilution and lengthens the drink. Combine the ingredients in a pot and heat it all on the stove for a few minutes, and you have a cocktail that will warm you to the bone.

When the weather turns cold, San Francisco bartender Jacques Bezuidenhout turns to the Heated Affair, a drink that will warm you better than any electric blanket. The cocktail features añejo tequila, a spiced apple cider that you make quickly on the stove and a topper of heavy cream. Served in an Irish Coffee mug with a cinnamon stick and dusting of fresh nutmeg, it’s a fine option whether you’re curled up on the couch under a blanket or hosting a holiday party. Many hot drinks call for whiskey or rum, so añejo tequila may not be the first spirit you think of when making cocktails, but it displays its flexibility in this recipe. The aged tequila takes on baking spice notes from the oak barrel, which meld seamlessly with the spiced apple cider. And the cream gives the whole package a silky, luxurious texture. Take one sip of the Heated Affair, and you’ll see that tequila works just as well in your winter warmers as it does in your summer refreshers. 11 Hot Boozy Drinks to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Partida añejo\xa0tequila'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'hot spiced apple cider'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon stick', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Pour boiling water into an Irish Coffee glass until it warms, then discard the water.', 'Add the tequila and hot spiced apple cider into the glass.', 'Top with a splash of heavy cream.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg and a cinnamon stick.']",127,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bring-me-back-something-french/,Bring Me Back Something French,Liquor.com,"Slow cookers are often considered solely as tools for cooking meals, something in which to heat chili or slow roast meats. But your Crock-Pot also happens to be the perfect vessel for large-format hot cocktails . Not only can it keep your cold-weather drink at the perfect sipping temperature, but it can maintain that temp for up to six hours. It doesn’t discriminate, either: you can give glöggs , Hot Toddies , mulled wines and boozy cocoa the slow cooker treatment, and soon enough your home or bar will be filled with a warm, aromatic holiday aroma. That’s especially true for the Bring Me Back Something French, an easy to make, easy to drink chocolatey concoction spiked with absinthe. There’s something about the marriage of anise and chocolate, which this rich, low-alcohol hot cocoa recipe exemplifies. Created by Stephen Denaro when he was at Craft & Commerce in San Diego, the Bring Me Back Something French is simple enough to build, with the bulk of the work being the preparation of the hot chocolate itself. Once you’ve made that and whipped up the vanilla whip cream, you’ll only need to add the absinthe (Denaro uses Pernod, but others will do as well). This makes it an excellent drink for your next holiday party, leaving you free to mingle while the drink simmers. Of course, if you’re not a fan of absinthe, you can swap it for another ingredient, though that fundamentally changes the recipe. Similarly, the vanilla whip cream is versatile—consider topping your next Emerald Isle of the Caribbean or Irish Coffee with it for an additional touch of vanilla. Finally, the drink calls for an unconventional garnish: two Pocky sticks, the flavor of which is your choice. This popular Japanese candy is fairly ubiquitous, but if you can’t find it at your local grocery store, check your nearest Asian speciality market. 4 Warming Crock-Pot Cocktail Recipes to Try at Home RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'absinthe, like Pernod'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'hot chocolate'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'vanilla whipped cream', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'decorative sugar', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Pocky sticks'}]","['Add the absinthe and 6 ounces of hot chocolate into a decorative mug and stir to combine.', 'Garnish with vanilla whipped cream, decorative sugar and 2 Pocky sticks.']",5,

At ski resorts around the world, powder hounds, ski bums and park rats can be found socializing and celebrating their success on the mountain with a round or two in classic après fashion. This late-afternoon activity is so popular that many snow bunnies skip the lifts altogether and simply appear for the après part of the day, creating a winter drinking culture unto itself. One popular place to ski and drink: Lake Tahoe. “The après scene in Tahoe is different all around the lake,” says Grace Rainwater, a bartender at Caliente in Lake Tahoe’s Kings Beach in California. The North Shore, where Rainwater bartends, is known for having a more local, less corporate feel. “As a local, coming down off the mountain has a mellow feel to the day, compared to summer when the sun stays out later and people are usually more in a party mode.” Nothing can compare to a warm, boozy cocktail to reheat your frozen bones après-ski. The Rumplesnuggler is made with hot chocolate, Baileys and Rumple Minze peppermint schnapps, plus whipped cream on top, if you want it. “It tastes like winter in your mouth,” says Rainwater. “And it definitely screams Lake Tahoe. Rumple Minze is one of the top sellers in the area, as is Baileys for coffee in the morning.” You don’t have to ski to enjoy the Rumplesnuggler. Maybe you’ve been shoveling snow for the past hour. Or maybe you’ve spent all day lying on the couch under a cozy blanket.

Hot cocktails, like the Hot Toddy and Irish Coffee , have the versatility to fight the chill while also raising your spirits. In Scandinavian countries, Glögg is the go-to hot drink for winter, especially around the holidays. This staple beverage is a type of mulled wine, that is spiced and sweetened wine served hot. But unlike most mulled wines, Glögg is known to include nuts and dried fruit. These additions provide hints of flavor but are also there for snacking, which is why Glögg is traditionally served with a spoon. This Glögg comes from chef Marcus Jernmark, who helmed Michelin-starred restaurants Aquavit in New York and Frantzén in Stockholm. He combines red wine with ruby port for a rich, hearty base. Vodka boosts the drink’s potency, and a medley of fruits and spices, including figs, oranges, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon and long pepper (a sweeter, more citrusy relative of black pepper used in Scandinavian cuisine) bring additional flavors.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/apple-chai-gin-and-tonic/,Apple Chai G&T,Liquor.com,"While the Gin & Tonic is often considered more of a warm weather drink, this approach from Canyon Shayer of Philadelphia Distilling incorporates fall flavors with an apple chai syrup. With the inclusion of the caffeinated tea, it takes the G&T from its iconic late-night status to a brunch-friendly highball. With apple cider vinegar and a slightly spicy chai tea, the apple chai syrup proves not too sweet, with nuances light enough that you don’t want a strong spirit to overpower them. Since Shayer works with Philadelphia Distilling he naturally goes for the company’s gin, Bluecoat American dry gin, for the cocktail’s base. With gentle botanicals it serves well in the drink, but it’s not widely available outside of Pennsylvania. Those who want something similar can find it with other American dry gins like Aviation American gin or Copper & King’s American dry gin . A London dry gin like Tanqueray or Plymouth will work fine as the drink’s base, but the aromatics and botanicals won’t be the same. When it comes to selecting a tonic, the drier the better. Normally, Gin & Tonics aren’t made with simple syrup or other sweeteners, so the 3/4 ounce of apple chai syrup will noticeably raise the sweetness level. Q tonic is relatively austere, making it a good choice, and Fever Tree is always reliable. If your Apple Chai G&Ts are still coming out too sweet, you can always pull back on the syrup. A benefit of the Apple Chai G&T is that if you’ve had your fill of the highball but still have leftover apple chai syrup, you can use it in other drinks. Perhaps the most obvious use for it would be switching the simple syrup in an Old Fashioned for the apple chai syrup; apple and chai spices pair well with dark spirits like brandy , bourbon and aged rum , and will give the drink an autumnal touch. Use it in drinks like the Ruby Chai Appletini for even deeper apple and chai flavors, or sweeten your favorite Hot Toddy recipe with it for extra fall flavors. 5 Gin Drinks Perfect for Winter Sipping FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Bluecoat American dry gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'apple chai syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'bottle (11 fl oz)', 'ingredient': 'tonic'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'star anise pod', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a Collins glass with ice and add the gin and apple chai syrup.', 'Top with the tonic and stir gently to combine.', 'Garnish with a star anise pod.']",7,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/golden-purl/,Golden Purl,Liquor.com,"When the weather turns cold, people often turn to rich, aged spirits like whiskey, brandy and dark rum. These are fine choices, but they’re not the only choices at your disposal. Enter: gin. With its bracing botanicals, gin is regularly reserved for warm weather, making an appearance in G&Ts on hot summer nights or whenever you want to indulge in a classic Martini . But you can take this spirit to new levels during the winter. Gin has notes of pine, florals, citrus, roots and warming spices, making it the perfect choice for cold-weather cocktails. This includes the Golden Purl. A purl is an old-school English drink classically involving hot ale. It can be served with or without warming spices and a nice dollop of gin. In this recipe from Denver-based writer Linnea Covington, the ale is replaced with warm sparkling cider. The fizzy apple cider adds refreshing effervescence to the drink and works well with the dry gin and the sweet, bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup, which brings a hefty, buttery quality to the mix. Take a sip of the Golden Purl, and you may think it’s laden with citrus, but save for the bitters and garnish, there’s none. All that fruit-forward acid is courtesy of the cider alone.

They warm the body quickly and taste far better than a sweater. “There’s something so comforting about a good ol’ Hot Buttered Rum —the spices, the rich mouthfeel and a good barrel-aged rum,” says Portland, Oregon bartender Bryan Galligos. The classic version is made with rum, boiling water and a batter composed of butter, sugar and spices. Galligos follows the general template with his version, dubbed the Hot Buttered Fun, but takes a couple liberties that add extra flavor and depth to the cocktail. He starts with Plantation five-year-old rum, which hails from Barbados and is aged first in American oak barrels before moving into French oak. Lemon juice adds balance, while the sweetener is a DIY syrup made from apple tea and demerara sugar. But the pièce de résistance? A pat of butter studded with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, star anise, cardamom, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper and brown sugar. It’s floated on the hot surface, so the spices melt into the liquid and the flavor develops as you drink. “You can’t beat butter,” says Galligos. No arguments here.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hit-me-baby-one-more-gluhwein/,Hit Me Baby One More Glühwein,Céline Bossart,"When the weather starts to change from sunny to gray and cold, it’s time to put away the blenders and shakers and pull out the crock pots. More than just useful in slow cooking a pork shoulder or a hearty stew, slow cookers are a reliable and convenient device for making and serving hot drinks. And it’s hard to think of a more welcome and crowd-pleasing warm drink for the holiday season, or anytime during winter, than mulled wine, also known in Germany and Austria as Glühwein. Between the ode to Britney and the subtly sweet aromatic liqueur that defines the flavor profile of this recipe, this easy mulled wine riff is a cold-weather crowd pleaser. The Hit Me Baby One More Glühwein calls for syrah; this robust wine is often used in wine-based drinks like Glühwein or Sangria because of its dry-yet-fruity and full-bodied flavor profile. However, any good, dry, slightly fruity red wine should do the trick. Just exercise caution when selecting one for quality: too cheap, and the final product will reflect that. Too pricey and well, you’ve used an expensive bottle of wine and dumped a bunch of spices in it. It’ll probably taste good but the overall quality will be lost in the mix. Thanks to the use of cream sherry—which adds some salinity, nuttiness, and richness—as well as a minimal touch of honey, expect a rich, round mouthfeel. Originally, the recipe called for Townshend Bluebird Alpine Liqueur from Portland, Oregon’s tea-based distillery Thomas & Sons . Sadly, the distillery closed in December of 2019; while there’s no direct substitution, any other Alpine Liqueur can fill in here. The point is to add some subtle sweetness as well as the botanicals that evoke the spirit of wintery mountain ranges and post-ski trip imbibing. While the recipe calls for an hour of cook time, the luxury of the crock pot is that it’s difficult (though not impossible) to overcook the wine. Just keep an eye on it, and if it goes for too long and starts to cook down at all, reduce the heat and top off with a little extra wine. The other convenience is that you can serve the punch straight from the pot, and it will give your dining table a centerpiece when entertaining. 4 Warming Crock-Pot Cocktail Recipes to Try at Home FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '750-milliliter bottle', 'ingredient': 'syrah red wine'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cream sherry'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'alpine liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': '1/2', 'ingredient': 'Peels and juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon stick', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'star anise', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a slow cooker and set temperature to “low” for approximately one hour.', 'Switch to “keep warm” and serve as desired.', 'Garnish with a swath of orange peel along with spices of choice, such as a cinnamon stick, star anise and grated nutmeg.']",10,liqueur

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/savory-margarita/,Savory Bell Pepper Margarita,Dylan Garret,"The Margarita is one of the most popular and versatile drinks in bartending. While the classic recipe has changed little in the decades since it was first created, it does lends itself to all kinds of twists and additions. Fruits like strawberry , pineapple and watermelon are all common ingredients to include in a Margarita, though vegetables often remain underappreciated. Though the Spicy Margarita famously utilizes muddled jalapeño to give a mild kick to the cocktail's classic lime-and-orange profile, bell peppers can create entirely new dimensions of savory flavor. The aptly-named Savory Margarita from bartending icon Charlotte Voisey uses fresh red bell pepper juice to impart maximum flavor, allowing more juice to integrate throughout the drink than simply muddling would provide. The result? A savory, zesty kick that's balanced with honey syrup and enlivened with fresh cilantro. 11 Margarita Variations to Try RELATED ARTICLE If you have a juicer, the fresh red bell pepper juice is easy to make—simply toss in three to four bell peppers and allow the machine to do its thing. If you don’t have a dedicated juicer, an ordinary blender can also fill in. Seed and dice the peppers before adding them to the blender, then pulse until liquified. You may need to include a splash of water if the resulting pepper pureé is too thick, but add it in small amounts to avoid over diluting the juice. After blending, strain the resulting pulp through a fine-mesh sieve or cheese cloth into a clean glass jar or pint container. The juice will keep, airtight, for up to a week in the refrigerator. You can swap some or all of the red peppers for yellow or orange ones, but keep in mind that it will affect the sweetness of the drink, as well as its hue.

That’s why you’ll find unique takes on the Margarita all over the world, some featuring different spirits and liqueurs, while others boast unexpected citrus juices or garnishes. At Espita Mezcaleria in Washington, D.C., you can order the Mayahuel, a mezcal-laced version of the Margarita. The bar is known for its mezcal selection, stocking 100-plus bottles and aiming to highlight small producers. So. naturally, that dedication to good mezcal bleeds into the cocktail menu. The Mayahuel is made with espadin mezcal, which is the most common type of mezcal and one that you will frequently see in cocktails. Espita chooses an approachable espadin—nothing too smoky, so the other ingredients can shine. Those ingredients include triple sec, lime juice and agave nectar, putting the drink squarely in Margarita territory. However, it’s the garnish where the drink takes an especially fun turn. The Mayahuel calls for the glass to be rimmed with sal de gusano, or worm salt. This traditional salt is made by combining the dried, ground larvae found on agave plants with salt, chiles and sometimes citrus. In Mexico, it’s common to serve sal de gusano with mezcal, often accompanied by orange slices or jicama. The snack can be dipped into the salt and eaten between sips of the spirit. At Espita, they bring that worm salt directly to the rim of the cocktail glass, so you get a taste of the savory garnish with each sip. It’s a tasty pairing that will keep you going back for more.

These cocktails ooze class, served in stylish coupes or Nick & Nora glasses, garnished thoughtfully with fresh herbs or a simple yet elegant peel from a citrus fruit. The ¡A Huevo! is not one of those drinks. Something between a Michelada and Margarita , it comes from Casey Elsass—bartender and founder of Bushwick Kitchen, a company that makes hot sauces, maple syrup and honey. Its name, which roughly translates to “Hell yeah!’’, speaks for the drink—the ¡A Huevo! is silly, fun and the sort of thing to serve at your next game day gathering without getting too fancy about it. And despite its humble ingredients, or because of them, it still tastes great. According to Elsass, the tequila gets a sweetening assist from Bud Light Lime-A-Rita . This cheap malt beverage is essentially a canned and flavored beer masquerading as a margarita. The act is enhanced in the ¡A Huevo! with a bit of additional lime. “Fresh lime juice pushes the acid forward,” says Elsass. The choice of tequila is really up to the drink’s maker. Despite the temptation to use something really cheap, however, it’s still best to go with something you’d want to drink in a Margarita; this is especially true if you plan on making other drinks with the tequila (say, for instance, a Margarita). For hot sauce, Elsass says he’s a “ Valentina guy,” referencing the brand of pourable hot sauce from Guadalajara, and that it “leaves a gentle burn on the end.” As that sauce isn’t readily available in all markets, feel free to add whatever sauce you like best and with whatever level of heat you enjoy most. “Follow your heart,” Elsass says.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'hot sauce'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Bud Light Lime-A-Rita to top'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'tsp', 'ingredient': 'kosher salt'}]","['Salt the rim of a rocks glass.', 'Add the tequila and lime juice and hot sauce to a shaker with plenty of ice, and shake vigorously for 30 seconds.', 'Strain into the prepared glass, and top with Bud Light Lime-A-Rita.']",0,tequila

The Guadalajara Silver has stuck around since then for a reason—it’s bright, complex and expressive, and while it may seem like a lot of ingredients at first glance, this ultra-refreshing Margarita riff couldn’t be easier to make. For this recipe, Merino originally used Don Roberto’s Plata expression, but for the sake of convenience or preference, you can use virtually any unaged tequila when making the Guadalajara Silver at home. This style of tequila, which is commonly referred to as “blanco” or “silver,” typically do not undergo the barrel aging process and are often matured in stainless steel tanks, though some do spend up to 60 days in oak casks. Blanco tequilas are known for having fresh, youthful qualities, such as citrus elements and distinct grassiness along with notes like baking spices and garden herbs on the nose and palate. Merino’s use of this type of tequila in the Guadalajara Silver mirrors the freshness of three different just-squeezed juices, while ginger liqueur and a cinnamon-sugar rim tie it all together with a sharp, spicy bite. Here’s how to make your very own Guadalajara Silver at home.","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Sugar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ground cinnamon'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'silver tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ginger liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Granny Smith apple juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'apple slices', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Mix equal amounts of sugar and cinnamon on a small plate and use to coat the rim of a rocks glass.', 'Fill the glass with ice.', 'Add the tequila, juices and ginger liqueur to a shaker and fill with ice.', 'Shake and strain into the prepared glass.', 'Garnish with Granny Smith apple slices.']",0,tequila

Made from the refreshing combination of tequila , fresh lime juice, orange liqueur and sometimes agave nectar, the ingredients in a Margarita come together to create a refreshing, citrus-forward cocktail perfect for sipping on a hot summer day. The harmonious blend of ingredients also makes an ideal base for which to layer in new seasonal flavors: Think spicy, strawberry or pineapple margaritas. This Margarita variation from Australian bartender Ben Davidson takes the classic Margarita from summer to winter by integrating blood orange juice. Blood oranges are deep-red oranges that are sweeter, less tart and more floral than navel oranges. They are in season from winter to early spring in Mediterranean climates.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/becharita/,Becharita,Liquor.com,"Becherovka dates back to 1807 when it debuted in Karlovy Vary, near the western tip of what is now the Czech Republic. The bittersweet liqueur is made with an all-natural herbal recipe featuring more than 20 ingredients, plus mineral-rich water from its hometown. Becherovka is often described as having prominent notes of cinnamon and ginger, and though it’s regularly consumed as a shot in its home country, the liqueur can also be mixed into a variety of cocktails, including the Becharita. This recipe comes from drinks pro Simon Ford, but he’s not the cocktail’s creator—he says that it was invented by an unknown bartender, and the recipe was passed along to him. The Becharita is a fairly liberal take on the classic Margarita , but it shows the liqueur’s versatility. It contains tequila and fresh lime juice, and then rather than triple sec to complete the trinity, it includes Becherovka, peach nectar and simple syrup. The Becherovka adds its trademark notes of cinnamon and ginger, while the peach nectar puts fruit flavors front and center. In the U.S., Becherovka doesn’t have the same name recognition as other European-made digestifs like Jägermeister , but it’s still the go-to drink in the Czech Republic. If you head into a bar there, you’ll find locals making toasts and knocking back shots. You can do the same, whether you’re in Prague or at home—it has become a popular option stateside, following its acquisition by drinks giant Pernod Ricard in 2011.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/strawberry-basil-margarita/,Strawberry Basil Margarita,Liquor.com,"The Margarita is one of the most adored drinks of all time. Beloved by everyone from more casual drinkers to serious cocktail bartenders, the drink strikes that golden balance of tart and sweet, boozy and refreshing. On its own, it’s a near-perfect concoction, and there’s really no reason to mess with it. But there’s no reason to not mess with it, either—that’s part of the fun of the Margarita. Indeed, messing around and adding ingredients to a Margarita is one of the most appealing aspects of the drink. And fresh, real ingredients can do wonders for the classic cocktail. This is exemplified with the Strawberry Basil Margarita, a variation that has risen to be almost as iconic as the original itself. One of the best parts about the Strawberry Basil Margarita is that it’s not much more difficult to throw together than your traditional Marg. In this recipe from bartender Trudy Thomas of the Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, all that is required is muddling basil, strawberries, lime juice and simple syrup together, then adding tequila and Cointreau (or another triple sec if you’re not feeling up for a splurge). For extra sweetness and to enhance the fruitiness of the drink, the Strawberry Basil Margarita also receives the addition of a generous splash of maraschino liqueur. This won’t give the drink an intense cherry-like flavor, but it will accentuate the berry notes in a satisfying way. Like any drink with strawberries and/or basil, this libation is one for the warmer months, when fruit is ripe and basil is lush. Of course, with international trade and global markets, you can find strawberries and basil year-round, but unless it’s summer where you are, they won’t be as good. Instead try a drink like the Blood Orange Margarita during the colder months, when that citrus is in season.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'medium', 'ingredient': 'strawberries'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'basil leaves'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'basil leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the strawberries, basil, lime juice and simple syrup.', 'Add the tequila, Cointreau and maraschino liqueur and fill the shaker with ice, then shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Margarita glass or rocks glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with an additional basil leaf and a lime wheel.']",12,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/black-widow/,Black Widow,Liquor.com,"Black Widow may leave you thinking about creepy, crawly spiders. Or a Marvel movie starring Scarlett Johansson. But take one sip of this cocktail, and it may change your associations forever. Because this Black Widow combines tequila, lime juice and agave nectar (so, the makings of a good Margarita ) with fresh blackberries—hence the name—and basil leaves. Lest you were concerned, it gets its bite from that blanco tequila, not venom. The recipe comes from Duggan McDonnell, a San Francisco bartender and the author of “Drinking the Devil’s Acre: A Love Letter from San Francisco and Her Cocktails.” He begins by muddling the blackberries and basil in a shaker, releasing the former’s juices and the latter’s sweet herbal qualities. This step not only provides a punch of fresh flavor, but it also produces the drink’s bright-red color. Choose your favorite tequila for this cocktail, but make sure you select a blanco rather than a reposado or añejo. The dry, peppery, earthy profile of an unaged blanco props up the drink with a solid backbone and merges perfectly with the sweet berries and tart lime. On the other hand, a tequila that spent time in barrels would feature oaky accents like vanilla and caramel, which you don’t want in this drink. Shake everything together with ice, strain the refreshing contents into your glass and don’t forget the fresh basil and blackberry garnish for the full effect.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dirty-martini/,Dirty Martini,Dylan Garret,"The Dirty Martini features gin or vodka, dry vermouth, and olive brine. It's is one of the most popular savory cocktails ever created, and though it may feel like a modern creation, the drink has been a go-to Martini variation for over a hundred years. Believed to have originated in 1901, the Dirty Martini is often credited to New York bartender John O’Connor, who found inspiration in the classic Martini's olive garnish. First made by muddling the olive into the drink, and later by adding a splash of olive brine, the Dirty Martini took decades to reach a wide fan base. It eventually found favor among drinkers, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who often mixed them for guests in the White House. The Evolution of Martini Styles RELATED ARTICLE As the Dirty Martini has grown in popularity, bartenders have increasingly begun to tailor the drink, improving the it with better technique and higher quality ingredients. That includes fresh vermouth and artisan olive juice. Why the Dirty Martini Works Most frequently comprised of just gin or vodka and dry vermouth, the classic Martini creates an incredibly versatile and flexible template to experiment with. The classic Dry Martini is the standard bearer, but countless riffs take the drink in new directions, from the 50/50 Martini , which combines equals parts gin and dry vermouth, to the Perfect Martini , which includes both sweet and dry vermouth. Each of these variations essentially revolves around changing the weight of the cocktail to place the focus on a different aspect of the drink. A Dry Martini favors the spirit, only using a minute amount of vermouth to add nose to the cocktail without softening the gin or vodka excessively. A Wet Martini or 50/50 shifts toward vermouth, creating a more aromatically complex drink with heavier body. Understanding the Main Types of Vermouth RELATED ARTICLE The Dirty Martini uses brine in much the same way we use salt in cooking, to accentuate both the sweet and savory components of vermouth while tamping down any bitterness. As the brine takes on natural oils from the olives, this also allows it to create mouthfeel and body in the Martini, without increasing the total volume of vermouth. Should a Dirty Martini Use Vodka or Gin? As with all Martinis, the choice of gin or vodka is a matter of preference. However, while many bartenders default to gin as the ideal option for a standard Martini, many find vodka to be the better choice for a Dirty Martini. This is because the spirit’s more neutral profile allows the olive brine to shine more prominently, without getting muddled by gin's heavier botanicals. You can choose whichever spirit you prefer, as both do an admirable job, but if you're looking for a more olive-forward option, vodka may be your ideal choice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/5050-martini/,50/50 Martini,Liquor.com,"The classic Martini has a storied history, although one that is difficult to pin down with precision. The Dry Martini as we know it today likely took form around the turn of the 20th century, and has been a popular vehicle for experimentation ever since. The usual recipe of gin, dry vermouth and sometimes bitters leaves a lot of room for interpretation. Go heavy on the gin for a drier drink, and use more vermouth for a wetter drink. But even those Wet Martinis typically don’t give the gin and vermouth equal footing. For that, you must look to the 50/50 Martini. This variation calls for equal parts gin and dry vermouth , yielding a drink that is lower in alcohol and far less dry than most recipes. The drink’s origins are even fuzzier than the classic, and it’s likely the 50/50 ratio of ingredients has been experimented with many times over the years. But the drink’s first appearance in a cocktail book belongs to Harry Craddock’s famed 1930 tome, The Savoy Cocktail Book . The Right Way to Order a Martini RELATED ARTICLE Like many old-school drinks, the 50/50 Martini all but disappeared from rotation until a band of pioneering bartenders brought it back to life in the late-1990s and early-2000s. Sasha Petraske served the cocktail at Milk & Honey, and Audrey Saunders put it on her menu at the influential Pegu Club—both located in New York. Dubbed the “Fitty-Fitty,” Pegu Club’s version featured identical measures of gin and vermouth, plus one dash each of Fee Brother’s orange bitters and Regan’s orange bitters. In fact, it was at Pegu Club that many drinkers were first introduced to the 50/50 Martini’s charms. When making the cocktail for yourself, you have three important decisions: which gin to use, which vermouth to use, and whether to add orange bitters. This ability to choose your own adventure allows you to personalize the drink to your tastes. A London dry gin and floral French vermouth veers more traditional, while a modern, less juniper-heavy gin paired with an herbal, bitter vermouth can take the flavor in new directions. Orange bitters are there to provide structure and a mild zesty note, should that sound appealing. With its lighter flavor profile and lower-alcohol sensibilities, the 50/50 might not be the Martini you’re used to, but it’s a Martini worth meeting.

Its name directly translates to Christmas Punch, and while there are many variations of it, with households having their own recipes and personal touches, its main elements are winter spices, fresh fruits and dark spirits.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-beatnik/,Beatnik,Liquor.com,"This stirred nightcap comes from San Francisco bar pro Duggan McDonnell, combining a trio of ingredients not often found together in the same cocktail glass: bourbon, tawny port and the bittersweet amaro Averna. Amari might be known primarily as something to be sipped from a cordial glass after dinner, but there’s a world of possibility that comes with the category. Made by macerating a combination of ingredients such as herbs, citrus peels, spices, roots, and barks, an amaro (or bitter Italian liqueur) can come in many different forms—bright and bitter, like Campari or Aperol, or deep, dark, and bittersweet, like Braulio or Averna. In the Beatnik cocktail’s case, the viscosity and gentle herbaceousness of Averna makes an intriguing base, especially when paired with sweet, nutty tawny port and an ounce of bourbon. “Bittersweet cocktails are always my go-to,” says award-winning bartender GN Chan, who co-owns and operates cocktail bar Double Chicken Please in New York City’s Lower East Side neighborhood with fellow bartender extraordinare Faye Chen. “[The Beatnik] is a spirit-forward cocktail and is slightly desserty; personally, I like it with my cigar after dinner.” When it comes to using Averna in cocktails, Chan offers a few pointers: “Averna has very nice, earthy, herbaceous aroma, [and] it goes really well with citrus and berries. That’s why tawny port is one of its best friends.” McDonnell calls for a specific bourbon, Hudson Whiskey's Bright Lights, Big Bourbon, in this drink. Until its relaunch in autumn 2020 it was known as Hudson Baby Bourbon, so if you already have a bottle of that whiskey on your bar cart, it's exactly what you'll want to use in this drink. Its relatively hefty ABV of 46% (that's 92 proof) allows it to hold up well to the large measures of the drink's other ingredients, and its notes of vanilla and salted caramel complement the flavors of the Averna and the nuttiness of the tawny port.

It’s a real winner at parties, where you can lay out various ingredients and let your guests choose their own adventure. Different chocolates will produce different tasting drinks; just be sure to choose a chocolate that will melt smoothly in your mug. The milk is also up to you—choose whole milk for a richer drink, and lower-fat milk for a lighter beverage. Those same principles apply to the spirits, too. If you want to spike yours with whiskey, go for it. If someone would rather use rum, no problem: Break out the rum. And if another person prefers añejo tequila or brandy, great, both spirits make a fine drink. There are no rules here, but aged spirits tend to work best.

Versions of the cocktail date back to Colonial America, and recipes have since been printed in cocktail tomes like Jerry Thomas’s famed 1862 “Bartenders Guide” and mid-20th century Tiki books. So, you can’t dispute the drink’s place in American cocktail history, but you can debate its merit. One of the chief complaints about the Hot Buttered Rum is that many recipes call for adding a dollop of butter to the drink before serving, which leaves an unappetizing oil slick on top of the cocktail. The best solution to this buttery problem, according to author Wayne Curtis, is to skip the last-minute butter and instead use a batter made with, oddly enough, ice cream. This easy tweak to the typical recipe yields a friendlier drink that looks and tastes better than the original. Make the batter by mixing the ice cream with butter, brown sugar, sugar, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Store the mixture in the freezer and you’ll be ready to use it during the holidays or whenever the craving strikes. When the time comes, all you need to do is fetch some rum and boiling water. Merge the three ingredients in a mug, and you’ll have a smooth, creamy and perfectly incorporated Hot Buttered Rum that’s ready to warm you up on a cold day.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/buddys-busy/,Buddy’s Busy,Liquor.com,"Beer is football’s favorite drink. And for good reason—a refreshing beer pairs perfectly with long afternoons and salty snacks like chips and wings. But there’s no reason cocktails can’t make an appearance on game day. So for the 2016 football season, we asked a bartender from each NFL team’s hometown to provide the perfect cocktail to represent their team. Chicago bartender Christiana DeLucca created Buddy’s Busy to honor the Chicago Bears. “This cocktail is an ode to the ’85 Bears and the fleeting Honey Bears cheerleaders. I have vivid memories of watching them both during that season, even at six years old,” says DeLucca. “It’s also an homage to Buddy Ryan’s 4–6 defense. That man is a legend, and this is my tip o’ the hat to him in cocktail form.” The drink features bourbon, Bärenjäger and Jeppson’s Malört , plus honey, fresh lemon juice and chai. It then receives a topping of freshly whipped cream before it’s dusted with nutmeg. It’s hot, soothing and sports three kinds of liquor, so it’s ready to address celebratory moments as well as heartbreaking losses. Bärenjäger is a German-made honey liqueur whose name translates to “bear hunter” and whose recipe dates back to the 18th century. It was originally formulated to lure bears out of their dwellings, but today it’s just a friendly addition to cocktails that provides some 70-proof honey sweetness to everything it touches. Jeppson’s Malört is a bitingly bitter wormwood-based liqueur with a rabid following in Illinois—the state drink’s 90% of the bottles produced. Founded by Carl Jeppson, a Swedish immigrant living in Chicago at the time, Malört was intended to mimic besk brännvin, a style of extra-bitter wormwood schnapps that was popular in Sweden. That herbal bitterness is rounded out by the Bärenjäger and a dose of buckwheat honey. Lemon juice adds balance to the equation, before the drink receives a dose of chai black tea, a topper of freshly whipped cream and a nutmeg garnish. “Served Toddy style, this cocktail is all about embracing the fall season,” says DeLucca. “Make a large batch, grab a thermos, and you’ve got the perfect tailgating cocktail to impress your friends.” 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'heavy whipping cream'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Bärenjäger'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Jeppson’s Malört'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Davids Tea Pumpkin Chai black tea'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add heavy whipping cream to an empty bottle, and shake for about 1 minute until lightly whipped.', 'Add the bourbon, Bärenjäger, Jeppson’s Malört, honey and lemon juice to a mug or other glass, then add the hot tea.', 'Top with the freshly whipped cream.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",0,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/marguerite/,Marguerite,Liquor.com,"The Martini is an iconic cocktail, but its entrance to the cocktail scene was preceded by several important drinks, including the Martinez , which calls for sweet vermouth, and the lesser-known Marguerite. The earliest written mention of the Marguerite dates to 1900, when the recipe appeared in Harry Johnson’s New and Improved Bartender’s Manual . The original recipe called for equal parts Plymouth gin and French (dry) vermouth, plus orange bitters and a dash of anisette, a sweet anise-flavored liqueur. It didn’t take long for subsequent versions to pop up, and by 1904 the anisette had been dropped. This tweak resulted in a drier drink and put us one step closer to the Dry Martini as we know it today. This recipe comes from bartending legend Dale DeGroff, who sticks to the preferred formula of Plymouth gin, dry vermouth, and orange bitters. Plymouth gin, which is composed of seven botanicals, including orange peels and green cardamom, is an important component of the cocktail. Falling between Old Tom, a sweeter style of gin called for in the Martinez, and bone-dry London dry gin, Plymouth is soft and citrusy with a subtle juniper note. Its character complements the vermouth and pairs deftly with the orange bitters, allowing all three ingredients to shine. The next time you’re craving a gin cocktail, try stirring up the Marguerite. It hits all the familiar notes of a Martini, and it’s still plenty stiff, but it provides a softer drinking experience from start to finish.

In February 2019, within Dubai’s sleek W hotel, Bottura opened Torno Subito , a bright and spunky restaurant inspired by the time the chef spent during the 1960s summering along the Italian Riviera. It’s rife with seafood dishes like orecchiette cooked in burrata juice and creamed salted cod, and bar supervisor Manuel Mora devised a cocktail list that leans heavily on Italian ingredients, such as a blend of olive oils he uses in the Massimo Bond, a riff on the classic Dry Martini . Mora says he wanted to create a twist on the classic cocktail but with a much richer flavor and smoother delivery. So he turned to a process called nitrogen cavitation that induces rapid flavor infusion via “homogenizing cells and tissues using rapid decompression of gases.” “I add nitrous oxide to the mixture of ingredients in the cream whipper, and the pressurized gas dissolves into the cells of the ingredients,” says Mora. When the pressure is released, nitrogen bubbles form within the cells and expand, breaking the cell walls and ultimately releasing flavor compounds that easily dissolve and permeate the gin. Mora then blends that mixture with several Ligurian olive oils, melted sage-infused butter and fat-washes the elixir for eight days. However, to simplify the process, Mora devised an easier recipe for home bartenders. Named after both Bottura and James Bond—the iconic Martini lover—the Massimo Bond offers a sophisticated new way to look at the Dirty Martini . 11 Martini Variations to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sage leaves'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'olive oil gin'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Mancino secco vermouth or Martini extra dry Italian vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'pink Himalayan salt solution'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: Taggiasca olive, skewered', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sage leaves'}]","['Add the sage leaves into a mixing glass and crush very gently with a muddler.', 'Add the olive oil gin, vermouth, salt solution and ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a skewered Taggiasca olive and 3 sage leaves.']",13,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/color-changing-martini/,Color-Changing Martini,Liquor.com,"When the classic Martini was invented, bartenders could never have known the iterations it would go through. They might have been able to predict subtle twists involving olive juice and various liqueurs, as such progressions are natural. But Martinis that change color right before your eyes? Probably not. The Color-Changing Martini was created by Desiree Bacala, a bartender at Public Belt inside the Hilton New Orleans Riverside hotel. It changes color from deep purple to a bright pink, which may seem like magic, but there’s science behind the phenomenon. The cocktail features gin, ginger liqueur, b’Lure—a butterfly pea flower extract—and simple syrup, plus a dose of freshly squeezed lemon juice. The edible blossom infuses the drink with an intense indigo tone that, when mixed with a high-acid ingredient, causes the color to shift from deep blue to pink or purple. In this case, the lemon juice causes that change, but other acidic ingredients like tonic can also produce the eye-catching effect. It’s easy to dismiss the Color-Changing Martini and similar drinks as too elaborate or technical to try at home, but don’t be intimidated. One of the great aspects of b’Lure is its accessibility. There is no need for high-tech equipment or hours of prep. Squeeze a few drops into your drink, mix with an acid, and, like magic, the color will change. If you really want to impress your friends (or even yourself), you can also freeze the citrus into ice cubes. As the lemony cubes melt, they will interact with the butterfly pea flower extract and slowly alter the color as they infuse the drink with flavor. This Is How to Turn Your Cocktails Purple.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smoky-martini/,Smoky Martini,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to think of a pre-dinner drink more respected and sublime than the Dry Martini . Elegant, bracing, strong, and refined, it’s the perfect opening to a steak dinner or other hearty meal, as well as a lovely way to end an evening. But how can you add further depth, richness, and boozy sophistication to the classic cocktail? The answer comes from bartending legend Dale DeGroff. For his Smoky Martini, the educator, author, and historian replaces the vermouth in the classic with a blended Scotch whisky. In sparing quantities, the spirit’s smoky and savory notes dance beautifully with gin’s botanicals. In fact, this cocktail has a serious literary pedigree. In Norman Mailer’s 1991 novel Harlot’s Ghost , a character based on real-life CIA agent William King Harvey, who ran the Agency’s West Berlin operations in the 1950s, mixes a Martini by rinsing the ice in a shaker with scotch before adding the gin. Bartenders at the time, according to DeGroff, picked up on the recipe and started referring to it as the Berlin Station Chief. “I am not sure whether Mailer’s research is so good that he would have wanted a drink that the character would have actually been drinking in 1956,” says DeGroff, “but I was serving Smoky Martinis in the 1970s.” We can’t be certain whether it was a CIA agent, a legendary author, or a clever bartender who first put scotch in a Martini.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cherry-bulldog/,Cherry Bulldog,Liquor.com,"Gin is a workhorse cocktail ingredient that pairs with all manner of modifiers, from liqueurs and fresh citrus to vermouth. You can see this in classics like the Gimlet and Martini and also in creative originals, as bartenders regularly turn to gin for a drink’s base spirit. But cherries are one companion you don’t often see joining gin in the glass. We’re not talking about cherry liqueurs like maraschino or Herring Cherry—we mean the bright-red fruits that are often employed to top Manhattans and ice cream sundaes. The Cherry Bulldog cocktail shows that cherries and gin belong together. This recipe by veteran New York bartender Michael Waterhouse features cherries, lime wedges, a star anise pod, demerara sugar, London dry gin and ruby port, plus a cherry garnish, naturally. Waterhouse specifically calls for fresh Bing cherries, which are large, dark and firm cherries known for their sweet taste. Although one of the most widely cultivated cherry varieties, Bings are a mid-year fruit that are typically available in June and July. So, when the season arrives, take full advantage and stock up. Then you’ll be ready to mix Cherry Bulldogs at a moment’s notice, and you’ll also have a ready supply of healthy snacks. The cherries are muddled with the lime wedges, star anise pod and sugar, providing a flavor-packed mixture in the shaker before any of the liquid ingredients go in. The dry gin adds its trademark botanical, juniper-forward punch, while the ruby port lends luscious notes of red fruits and its eye-catching color. Shaken and strained, the red-hued cocktail pops with cherry notes, citrus and spice, all tempered by the herbal gin and sweet port. When making the drink at home, be sure to double-strain the contents into your glass, as you don’t want any of those gritty bits of star anise impeding your sips.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/breakfast-martini/,Breakfast Martini,Alex Frane,"Normally, when people think of drinks that are acceptable alongside their eggs and toast, their minds go to the holy trinity of brunch drinks: the Bloody Mary, Mimosa and Ramos Gin Fizz. Generally, the Martini is not counted amongst those august peers, as normally the only time to drink them during the day is if you’re throwing back to the era of the “three Martini lunch.” Then London bartender Salvatore Calabrese created a Martini you can enjoy any time of day without being a midcentury business executive. The secret is including orange marmalade. The story goes that Calabrese, who normally opted for an espresso for breakfast, developed the idea for the Breakfast Martini after his wife encouraged him to have some toast and marmalade one morning. He then went to work at the Library Bar at the Lanesborough Hotel and created what has become a modern classic. Despite its name and its gin base, the cocktail doesn’t share much in common with your average Martini. Instead, it has similarities to a White Lady , with gin, orange liqueur and freshly squeezed lemon juice; some versions of it even call for an egg white, though that is not included in the original recipe. There’s also a resemblance to another breakfast drink, the Corpse Reviver #2 , which likewise includes gin, orange liqueur, and lemon juice, though that cocktail adds absinthe and an aperitif. The exact ingredients for the cocktail are flexible. Feel free to use whatever gin style or brand most appeals. Similarly, while most recipes call for Combier as the orange liqueur, others like Cointreau or Grand Marnier can work well instead. While it is called the Breakfast Martini, there’s nothing stopping you from enjoying it at another time of day. The drink is bright, juicy, and vivid, with a touch of sweetness and a good balance of tartness, perfect for a pre-dinner aperitif or a late night indulgence. If you really love it, you can even try your hand at making your own kumquat marmalade for a real treat .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lady-in-blue/,Lady in Blue,Liquor.com,"Gin is the starting point for many great drinks, from well-known classics to modern inventions. Its dry, botanical profile blends seamlessly into both spirit-forward and citrusy cocktails, making it a tried-and-true choice for professional bartenders and enthusiasts. This is evident in everything from the Martini to the White Lady , a 1919 cocktail that was created by legendary barkeep Harry MacElhone. It showcases gin alongside orange liqueur, lemon juice and egg white, and it’s the inspiration for the Lady in Blue, a modern adaptation from Louisville bartender Eron Plevan. Plevan created the drink while working at the famed Seelbach hotel . His recipe features dry gin, creme de violette, blue curaçao , lemon juice, simple syrup and orange flower water. The blue and aromatic cocktail has a floral flavor tempered by the dry gin and tart lemon, and it receives an extra dose of eye-catching color via an edible flower garnish. The Lady in Blue skips the White Lady’s egg white, so the former lacks the frothy texture of the latter. It also mixes things up by adding a small measure of creme de violette, a violet liqueur best known for its use in the Aviation . This, plus the orange flower water, is what gives the Lady in Blue its floral, perfumed character. Blue curaçao is a Caribbean liqueur made using the dried peel of the Laraha citrus fruit, and then dyed blue. It’s poured last into the Lady in Blue, after the cocktail has been shaken and strained, as a tribute to the long-term ghostly guest of the supposedly haunted hotel. You can accomplish this final step by slowly slipping the liqueur down the side of the glass so that it layers on the bottom. But if that’s too much work, you can also add it directly into your shaker with the rest of the ingredients.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cosmopolitan-1934/,Cosmopolitan 1934,Liquor.com,"There has been plenty written about the famously pink 1990s institution that is the Cosmopolitan . Unlike most cocktails, whose origins are cloudy at best, the creation of the Cosmo can be clearly traced to Toby Cecchini, who purportedly invented the drink in 1988 while working at The Odeon in New York City. And, of course, its popularity can be largely attributed to the drink’s presence on “Sex and the City”. While the Cosmopolitan is a perfectly pleasing drink, it’s also very much an artifact of its time. During the 1980s and 1990s, vodka reigned supreme amongst spirits, even in cocktail bars. However, go back a few decades to the end of Prohibition and the second age of cocktail invention, and you’ll not see much in the way of vodka drinks (vodka would take off a few years later with the creation of the Moscow Mule in 1941). What was a popular spirit in the latter part of the 1930s was gin. From the Martini to the Martinez , this juniper-centric infused spirit was very much in vogue. So when Naren Young—founder of Bartender magazine and the creative director at New York City bar Dante when it won the top spot from the World’s 50 Best Bars—put his 1930s spin on the 1980s classic, he switched out the citrus vodka for gin. He specifically uses Nolet’s silver gin, a fruit and floral-forward Dutch gin rather than the more commonplace London Dry. Cointreau sticks around in the drink, but lemon juice replaces the lime for a touch more sweetness. Most important, though, is the swapping of a homemade raspberry syrup for the cranberry juice that gives the drink its signature pink flush. Like changing vodka for gin, it encompasses the earlier era better, as cranberry juice in drinks wasn’t much of a trend until after the 1960s, when a collective of cranberry growers called Ocean Spray started publishing recipe booklets that included cranberry juice. The raspberry syrup gives the drink a gentle sweetness and fruitiness without overpowering it. It’s also useful for making the Clover Club, a close relative of the Cosmopolitan 1934.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': ""Nolet's silver gin""}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'raspberry syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dehydrated orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Cointreau, lemon juice and raspberry syrup to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a flamed orange peel and a dehydrated orange wheel (a fresh orange wheel can be used instead).']",16,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/black-russian/,Black Russian,Dylan Garret,"The Black Russian is a simple, two-ingredient cocktail that consists of vodka and coffee liqueur. It’s the forebearer to the more popular White Russian , which follows the same base but includes cream. Despite its name, the Black Russian has no direct ties to the country that shares its name. Rather, the moniker simply comes from its use of vodka, much the same as the Moscow Mule , which was invented in Los Angeles. The Black Russian’s origins seem to lay with a bartender named Gustave Tops at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels, Belgium, sometime around 1949. It’s said that Tops first created the drink for Perle Mesta, a U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg, who was a socialite known for hosting lavish parties. Why the Black Russian Works Though a seemingly basic, two-part cocktail , the Black Russian still follows a well-established cocktail flavor template: spirit, sweet, and bitters. In the drink, the spirit is of course vodka, while coffee liqueur pulls double duty as both the sweetening and bittering agent, albeit with an emphasis on the former. 10 Easy Two-Ingredient Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE While traditionally made with Kahlúa , a range of fantastic coffee liqueurs are now available on the market that allow you to tailor the drink to your specific tastes. A bottle like New Orleans-made St. George’s NOLA Coffee Liqueur will add notes of chicory and a more heavily roasted coffee aroma. If you’re looking for a less sweet option, Fratelli Branca Borghetti emphasizes the coffee’s bitterness and brings more espresso-like flavors. If you looking to mix things up but want to keep it accessible, Australia-based Mr. Black Coffee Liqueur balances both sides, while keeping the caffeine level high (containing up to 40% the amount of caffeine found in a shot of espresso). All told, the cocktail still works fantastically as an after-dinner option, and its simplicity remains a selling point.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/midori-sour/,Midori Sour,Liquor.com,"The Midori Sour is an emblem of 1970s. Its chief ingredient was launched in the U.S. in 1978 by Suntory, the Japanese company best known for coveted whiskeys and beers. Midori debuted stateside at Studio 54, the notorious New York nightclub, which was a fitting venue for the bright and showy liqueur. After enjoying success during the sweet cocktail heyday of the 1980s and ’90s, Midori fell out of favor amid the ensuing craft cocktail renaissance. But recently, it's found renewed life, as bartenders discover new uses for the liqueur’s distinctive flavor and color. Given its almost singular profile, Midori has few substitutes. So when an occasion calls for a bright-green drink or a customer demands a melon-flavored cocktail, Midori is ready to heed the call. What is Midori? Midori’s flavor is derived from Japanese muskmelons and the cantaloupe-like yubari fruit, which are both infused into neutral grain spirits. Before bottling, the melon spirit is blended with brandy and sugar and dosed with food coloring to achieve its characteristic intense color. Midori can be used in countless drinks, but it’s the Midori Sour that made the liqueur a household name. However, early versions of the cocktail often worked to turn the drink into a punchline, disguising Midori’s melon flavor with corn-syrup-rich sour mix, similar to how many Margaritas of the era were degraded by mass-produced artificially flavored mixers rather than created with fresh ingredients.

Its citrus stock recipe was conceptualized by co-founders Kelsey Ramage and Iain Griffiths alongside Ryan Chetiyawardana in London bar Dandelyan’s juicing room. It’s a simple yet effective 30-minute process of pressure-cooking spent citrus husks (pulp and all) in water, then straining and adjusting with acid and sugar to produce a liquid that essentially acts as a juice substitute or volume enhancer. It’s a waste-reduction and resource-doubling technique that offers something the usual suspects ( oleo saccharum , cordials, preserves, dehydrating for garnishes, and the like) do not. This recipe originally appeared as part of “ Repurpose Your Citrus with This Waste-Reducing Hack .”",[],"['Add the water and husks to a large pot and let boil for 5 minutes.', 'Remove the husks (your stock will go bitter if you leave any longer), giving a quick squeeze back into the mixture as you pull them out.

But if you’re a “Star Trek” fan who loves themed cocktails, well, your options have been limited. Fortunately, enterprising barkeeps like John deBary have concocted cocktails like the Romulan Ale Fizz to please the most passionate Trekkies. Romulan Ale is banned in the Federation, but that shouldn’t stop you from enjoying this fun cocktail, which is essentially a Gin Fizz sporting the Romulan’s characteristic cobalt color. It features navy-strength gin , blue curaçao, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white. Tonic marries the ingredients together and lends effervescence, while a few drops of orange blossom water provide a dose of floral aromatics.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sloe-gin-fizz/,Sloe Gin Fizz,Liquor.com,"Sloes are tiny berries that grow wild in hedgerows around England. Unpleasantly astringent on their own, they are popular in sweetened jams and preserves, and they develop a rich, tart flavor when infused in gin. Naturally, enterprising distillers have been incorporating them into liquor since the 17th century. The spirit takes on the essence and bright color of the berries, and then sugar is typically added to counter the fruit’s tartness. What’s left is not technically gin, but actually a gin-based liqueur. To experience the authentic flavor of sloe berries, use a British-style sloe gin, such as Plymouth, Hayman’s or Sipsmith. Most sloe gins are less boozy than their unflavored counterparts, and it’s common for them to clock in around 25% to 30% ABV. The British traditionally used sloe gin in wintry drinks, but it’s become most famous for its turn in America’s refreshing Sloe Gin Fizz, where it’s paired with club soda, citrus and simple syrup. This synergistic combo yields a cocktail that is sharp and quaffable, with sloe gin’s characteristic reddish purple hue. The Sloe Gin Fizz is certainly the most famous and craft-focused cocktail to utilize the colorful spirit, but sloe gin can also be found in ’80s-era favorites like the Alabama Slammer. However, while that college staple may feature the liqueur, it doesn’t highlight it front-and-center like the fizz. The Sloe Gin Fizz is a breezy take on the classic Gin Fizz , which uses a not-sloe variety as its base. While most Gin Fizzes employ egg white for a silky texture and creamy head, the sloe version often skips this protein-packed ingredient. However, that doesn’t mean you have to. If you’d like to add egg white to your drink, simply shake all the ingredients without ice to emulsify the egg with the liquids, then shake again with ice to chill the drink. You’ll be left with the same refreshing cocktail you know and love, but one that’s sporting a richer body and thicker head. Another easy way to experiment with the cocktail is by splitting the base between sloe gin and dry gin. This results in a cocktail that walks the line between a Gin Fizz and Sloe Gin Fizz, with milder berry notes and a fainter color—but one that still features the same easy-drinking sensibilities. 6 Collins-Style Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sloe gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the sloe gin, lemon juice and simple syrup into a cocktail shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Fill a highball or Collins glass with ice, and strain the contents of the shaker into the glass.', 'Top with the club soda.', 'Garnish with a lemon wedge and a cherry.']",207,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-fizz/,Gin Fizz,Liquor.com,"The fizz is a school of cocktail that features a spirit alongside citrus, sugar and sparkling water. If that sounds like a sour, plus soda, that’s because, well, it is. Both drinks often contain egg white, too. The History of the Gin Fizz The first printed recipe for a Gin Fizz appeared in the 1876 edition of The Bar-tenders Guide by Jerry Thomas. It appeared in that edition as a recipe included in the updated edition’s appendix, as noted by cocktail historian David Wondrich. The Gin Fizz is basically the frothy, bubbly, protein-packed cousin to the Tom Collins, which combines gin, lemon, sugar and soda. Within a few years of the Gin Fizz being included in Thomas’ updated book, the drink became immensely popular. Often as a mellow end-of-the-night send-off. In time, an egg yolk was added to the recipe to create the Golden Fizz, and an egg white included to launch the Silver Fizz. Fizzes enjoyed particular popularity stateside during the first few decades of the 20th century, up until the encroachment of Prohibition. The most famous Gin Fizz variation of all became the Ramos Gin Fizz , which is characterized by its inclusion of heavy cream and orange flower water. Invented in New Orleans, and still a popular cocktail in some parts of the city, it’s a luxurious take on the original Gin Fizz. There’s also the Sloe Gin Fizz, a riff that sports tart, berry-flavored sloe gin and often skips the egg white. Understanding the Main Types of Gin RELATED ARTICLE Why the Gin Fizz Works By all means, dabble with any and all fizzes. But you may appreciate the genre’s siblings more after tasting the original. To start there, with the classic Gin Fizz, begin with a good gin. The gin, as the only spirit in the cocktail, provides the base that the rest of the ingredients stand on. So now’s not the time to skimp on quality. A London Dry gin will add bracing botanical notes of juniper and the like against the tart citrus and creamy egg, while a modern-style gin with softer, more floral notes will produce an equally delicious—albeit different—version. If you want a thicker drink with a sturdy head, you will want to dry-shake the cocktail first. That means to shake it without ice to help the liquid ingredients merge with the egg white. If you’re going to take the dry-shake route, remember that a good dry-shake requires at least 15 seconds of shaking to properly meld the ingredients. Don’t cut corners here, if froth is your goal. Then, once you have accomplished your wrist workout and the clock has crept past 15 seconds, shake again with ice until everything’s cold, and strain the contents into your glass for a gorgeous layered look.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/green-deacon/,Green Deacon,Liquor.com,"At first glance after making the Green Deacon, you might be wondering where it got its name. This gin concoction comes out vividly orange thanks to the addition of grapefruit juice and sloe gin, not green. But its creator, bartending veteran behind New York City’s PDT and Portland, Oregon’s Takibi , Jim Meehan, has a story for how the drink was named. The drink’s history begins with a little-known cocktail called the Rosy Deacon, which was found in the “Stan Jones Bar Guide.” It calls for a mix of London dry gin, sloe gin and grapefruit juice. Sloe gin is an English spirit made with a gin base, then flavored with the astringent, tart sloe berries that grow wild throughout England. They give it the bright red color and tart flavors, which are balanced with added sweetener for a very different flavor than traditional gin. It’s most famous application is in a Sloe Gin Fizz . Meehan created the Green Deacon when Plymouth introduced its sloe gin to the United States. “This one was created when Plymouth Sloe Gin became available, many years after I’d begged Simon Ford [of Ford’s Gin and previous Plymouth brand ambassador] and Pernod Ricard to import it to the US,” Meehan says. His tweak to the drink was simple but dramatic: a rinse of absinthe , which at the time of the drink’s creation had just returned to the US for the first time since Prohibition. “Absinthe was still a popular ingredient back then—as it had just been legalized in 2007—and a friend named J.C. Iglesias suggested I add a rinse of it to the classic Rosy Deacon cocktail I’d served him,” Meehan explains. “We named the Rosy Deacon variation the Green Deacon to delineate the difference the rinse made to the original formula.” Because of the particularities of its ingredients, it’s not recommended to substitute another dry gin or sloe gin. If you’re really set on creating the Green Deacon at home, it’s advisable to stick with Plymouth for both, as that’s what his drink is balanced around. The absinthe, however, is more versatile as it only rinses the glass. Meehan suggests using one from St. George, a celebrated Californian distillery. While the grapefruit garnish might look a bit funny in a small cocktail glass, it’s all part of the presentation and the drink’s charm.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-gin-fizz/,Ginger Gin Fizz,Liquor.com,"The Gin Fizz is a classic. A simple-but-delicious marriage of a Gin Rickey and a Gin Sour , the drink is a popular beverage for both late-night drinking as well as for brunch. The Ginger Gin Fizz, served at Barcelona’s buzzy gin-focused cocktail bar Xixbar , is ideal for an early-morning pick-me-up, with the bright, bracing and slightly spicy inclusion of ginger to help start the day with a kick. Essentially, the drink works as a Gin Fizz but with a few minor tweaks. The smallest of these is adding some lime juice to the usual lemon juice. It’s only a quarter ounce, but it pairs nicely with ginger and adds extra tartness. That, in turn, is balanced by egg white, though there’s less here than normally called for in a Gin Fizz. The big change is the use of a ginger-infused gin. The process for making this is simple, though it takes a while. Merely slice up a quarter-cup of ginger, add it to your favorite gin and let it sit for a few weeks in a cool, dry space. Alternatively, using a sous vide device to rapidly infuse the ginger into the spirit can bring that time frame from a few weeks down to a few hours. But for those who aren’t blessed with a sous vide device at home, it only takes patience. That’s not all for the ginger, though: The Ginger Gin Fizz also calls for a few drops of ginger bitters. There are a few options on the market these days, including Hella Cocktail Co. , Bob’s Bitters and the popular Bittermens Bitters . The drink only calls for a few drops, but you can try them in other drinks to add some kick, like an Old Fashioned , Manhattan or even a Martini in place of orange bitters. For those who really adore the spice, try using the ginger-infused gin and the ginger bitters in your next Martini.

https://www.liquor.com/berry-smash-cocktail-recipe-7091311,Berry Smash,Audrey Morgan,"“The pink non-alcoholic beverage has a bad rep for always being too pink or just tasting like juice,” says Lauren “LP” Paylor. “I developed the Berry Smash as a beverage that could be enjoyed and appreciated as an N/A beverage and that has layers of flavors and complexity.” The non-alcoholic drinks category is of particular importance to Paylor, a pro bartender who holds double-duty as the CEO of Focus on Health , a non-profit that provides health and wellness programming for the hospitality industry. For her pink drink, Paylor looked to the typical smash format, a broader cocktail template that often calls for herbs and seasonal fruit. It includes a bevy of berries and mint leaves muddled with simple syrup, which are combined with cooled hibiscus tea and two herb-forward offerings from Seedlip, a non-alcoholic distilled spirits brand. Seedlip’s Garden expression includes peas and botanicals such as rosemary, spearmint, and thyme, while the citrusy Grove expression features ingredients like Mediterranean oranges, lemon peel, lemongrass, and ginger. The drink’s striking hue comes from the inclusion of hibiscus tea. “I love using tea in beverages,” says Paylor. “It serves [as] a diluting element in your beverage, adds complexity with flavor, can be manipulated with intensity depending on how long you steep it or how concentrated the tea is, and can sometimes mimic flavors that you would find in alcohol.” When brewing the hibiscus tea for this recipe, allow for a longer steep time to maximize its flavor, then allow it to cool to room temperature before adding to the other ingredients. Paylor’s creation is finished with ginger beer, which adds heat and effervescence. The result? A refreshing drink that is far more complex—and delicious—than the sum of its parts. 18 of the Best Non-Alcoholic Drinks to Make Year-Round RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberries'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'raspberries'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'blackberry'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Seedlip Grove'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Seedlip Garden'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'brewed hibiscus tea'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: mint sprig and powdered sugar', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle fruit and mint leaves with simple syrup.', 'Add remaining ingredients to the shaker and fill with ice.', 'Shake and strain into a highball glass filled with fresh pebble ice.', 'Top with ginger beer.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig and powdered sugar.']",6,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/stone-sour/,Stone Sour,Alex Frane,"Like many pre-Probhibition cocktails, the Stone Sour has a murky history—its exact origin and the reason for its name are both obscure. Its first recorded appearance seems to be in the pages of “The Ideal Bartender.” That book’s writer, bartender Tom Bullock, was the first Black American to publish a cocktail recipe book when he published this tome in 1917. His recipe for the Stone Sour called not for whiskey, but for Old Tom gin —this (often) barrel-aged gin is darker and sweeter than the more ubiquitous London dry style, and has only made a resurgence in recent years. Cocktail historian David Wondrich even suggests that the Stone Sour is the first published variation on a Gin Gimlet. In essence, though, the Stone Sour is a Whiskey Sour with added orange juice. Unlike lemon or lime, orange juice isn’t always the best-suited for cocktails, sometimes bringing an odd balance of sweet and sour that can be challenging to mix with. But it shines here, especially when freshly squeezed (really, if you plan on using pasteurized or concentrate orange juice, you might as well make a different drink). It’s refreshing while still maintaining its boldness, making it even easier to drink than your traditional sour. Given the extra volume of juice, however, it’s advisable to stick to a higher proof bourbon—something in the 100-proof range will serve admirably. And, if you enjoy the Stone Sour made with whiskey, try using an Old Tom gin like Bullock first did, or even try using Amaretto—it’s definitely on the sweeter side, but the Amaretto Stone Sour is another popular version of the cocktail. Try This 1970s Take on a Classic Sour 37 ratings One confusing aspect of the Stone Sour is that it also goes by the moniker the California Sour. Dale DeGroff, yet another lauded cocktail historian and writer, wrote in his book “The Craft of the Cocktail” that the two names were for the same drink, which was from California (It’s DeGroff’s general recipe that is featured here). However, that statement is complicated by the fact that Bullock never seemed to have lived or bartended in California. In any case, the Stone Sour (or California Sour) faded in popularity with the arrival of Prohibition, only to make a brief resurgence in the 1990s before dipping yet again during the so-called Cocktail Renaissance.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/izak/,Izak,Liquor.com,"Spirits, citrus and sugar: the holy trinity that creates one of the oldest drink categories, the sour. While some famous sours get their own titles—the Gimlet , Margarita and Daiquiri for instance—the humble Whiskey Sour has no such special designation. Still, that doesn’t mean it’s any less a delicious or compelling drink than any of its siblings, especially when bartenders take the time to play with it, adding their own spins and takes on the beloved classic . The Izak, from Massachusetts-based bartender Nick Checchio, enlivens the Whiskey Sour with the addition of some fresh squeezed orange juice, a generous splash of Italian amaro Cynar and, most notably, with spiced notes of cinnamon and dried harissa in a house-made syrup. The result is a nuanced but bracing sipper. For the booze side of things, Checchio uses Evan Williams White Label bourbon. This affordable whiskey is a favorite of bartenders for its low price tag, good quality and high proof. Checchio also adds some Cynar to the drink, an Italian amaro well-loved for its slightly vegetal, heavily aromatic bittersweet properties. Though famously made with artichokes, it doesn’t actually taste like the vegetable, so don’t let its reputation discourage you from including it in this, or any other, drink. The crux to the Izak, though, is the house-made harissa syrup, a heady mix of cinnamon, sugar and Izak N.37 from La Boîte , a New York City-based spice shop and blender.

The orange gourd is also a great candidate for drinking. You’ve got your typical Pumpkin Spice Lattes , popularized at a certain coffee chain and reconfigured into cocktails. You’ve also got Pumpkin Spice Old Fashioneds and other recipes. At their worst, pumpkin drinks can be cloying and unbalanced, but at their best, they are delicious seasonal treats. The Spiced Pumpkin Flip lands squarely in the latter category. This recipe from veteran bartender Naren Young features all the flavors of fall: bourbon, amaretto , and pumpkin in two forms—ale and butter—plus agave nectar and a whole egg, all topped with grated nutmeg. He says that he was inspired to create the cocktail after trying bartender Jim Meehan’s Great Pumpkin (rye, applejack, maple syrup, pumpkin ale and a whole egg) at PDT, the acclaimed New York bar. Young changed the whiskey, scrapped the applejack and accented his version with amaretto’s trademark notes of almonds and stone fruit. The result is a rich, silky, effervescent cocktail loaded with pumpkin flavor, perfect for holiday parties or chilly evenings by the fire.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smoky-sour/,Smoky Sour,Liquor.com,"This tantalizing cocktail by Jim Kearns—a New York City bartender and the beverage director of Golden Age Hospitality bars—is a smoky and frothy twist on the traditional Whiskey Sour . Already a delicious and popular drink, Kearns adds smoke and extra aromatics with two types of syrup: one, a turbinado and cinnamon syrup, the other made with smoky lapsang souchong tea. For his take on the classic, Kearns uses Tincup Whiskey . A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and American single malt whiskey from Colorado (where the distillery is located), Tincup is a moderately priced whiskey with large availability. Nevertheless, substituting it for another bourbon, or even rye, is acceptable, especially if you have a high-rye bourbon on hand. While the final recipe is as easy to throw together as any Whiskey Sour recipe with egg whites, prepping the two syrups is where the bulk of the work lies. The recipe calls for making a large volume of both syrups, and each will last around two weeks in the fridge. Because of this, it’s best to make the drink in large batches—say, for entertaining guests—unless you plan on making a lot throughout the week. The other option, once you’ve made enough Smoky Sours to suit your tastes, is to try the syrups in other drinks. For instance, the smoky tea syrup can add complexity to your favorite Bourbon Old Fashioned recipe, while the cinnamon syrup works well in a number of autumnal cocktails, and pairs well with aged rums in drinks like the Alyssum or the Undead Gentleman .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/new-york-sour-3/,Port New York Sour,Liquor.com,"Port was created in Portugal as a way to preserve the country’s red wines during their long, hot journey down the river from the vineyards in the Douro Valley to the town of Porto, where the wines are stored in warehouses and then shipped around the world. Port probably isn’t the first item that comes to mind when you’re stocking your bar with cocktail-friendly ingredients. It may not even be the second—or the tenth. But maybe it should be, as one bottle of port can multi-task to perform the job of several ingredients. It can add sweetness, replace vermouth, add multilayered flavor and temper the alcohol content of high-proof drinks. “Generally, port has a round, comforting, viscous sweetness that can play really nicely with Sours, Bucks and Mules,” says Washington, D.C., bartender Sarah Rosner. “I have also noticed a trend toward low-ABV cocktails recently and think it will start shifting from a modifier to a base.” Rosner uses the versatile ingredient in her Port New York Sour recipe, a riff on the New York Sour that skips the optional egg white and replaces red wine with tawny port. She begins with bourbon, fresh lemon juice and simple syrup, and then floats the port over the top of the drink, creating an eye-catching halo effect. That healthy one-ounce pour of tawny port helps to deplete the bottle fast (port only lasts a few weeks once open and refrigerated), while lending nutty and caramel notes to the cocktail.

It combines wine with fruit, sugar and sometimes liquor, giving the maker nearly unlimited permutations at their disposal. Red wine, brandy and berries will produce a far different Sangria than one made with white wine, vodka and grapes. Therein lies the fun. The Front Porch Swing was created by bartending vet H. Joseph Ehrmann, the proprietor of Elixir in San Francisco, which he opened in 2003. His take on Sangria features your choice of Square One cucumber vodka or Square One botanical spirit. The former combines rye vodka with the essence of fresh cucumbers, while the latter also begins with rye spirit, but then gets infused with eight botanicals: pear, rose, chamomile, lemon verbena, lavender, rosemary, coriander and citrus peel. It’s floral, fruity and herbal, walking the line between vodka and gin to lend complexity to cocktails. Ehrmann also enlists white wine (he suggests sauvignon blanc, Sancerre, albariño or verdejo), plus St-Germain elderflower liqueur, a handful of fruit and either mint or tarragon—dealer’s choice. Shake all your ingredients together and pour the contents unstrained into a wine glass. Doing so leaves you with a cornucopia of fragrant snacks swimming in your drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pink-peppercorn-botanical-gimlet/,Pink Peppercorn Botanical Gimlet,Liquor.com,"The Gimlet is a classic cocktail composed of gin, lime juice and sugar. Like many classics, it’s also a favorite jumping off point for bartenders—both the professional and at-home variety—to experiment. The well-balanced ingredients are welcoming to simple swaps like using vodka in place of gin (hello, Vodka Gimlet ) as well as more elaborate outside influences, like muddled fruits and herbs. The Pink Peppercorn Botanical Gimlet updates the cocktail’s original formula to include a handful of new ingredients, including spicy peppercorns and agave nectar, rather than sugar. But its most intriguing tweak involves a botanical liquor from Square One Organic Spirits , which was founded in 2004 by Allison Evanow, a pioneer in the category. “The qualifying factor to be called ‘botanical’ anything is that you have to actually use the real plant in some way,” she says. From this launching point, distillers can cross into other categories, like botanical whiskey or rum. Square One Botanical is distilled from organic rye and water and infused with chamomile, citrus peel, coriander, lavender, lemon verbena, pear, rose and rosemary. The unaged spirit is not gin and it’s not billed as vodka. “I think bartenders especially, but also more knowledgeable consumers, are now understanding that a reference to botanical spirits is simply a broader genus term for a spirit that relies on its main flavor profile from a collection of botanicals regardless of spirit type,” says Evanow. The botanical spirit lays down a base of fruity, floral and herbal notes, while freshly muddled pink peppercorns lend aromatic spice. Agave nectar and lime juice provide the necessary sweetness and citrus to balance the flavors, producing a Gimlet variation that is light, refreshing and will keep you coming back for more.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sea-blues/,Sea Blues,Kelly Magyarics,"It’s a poolside sipper and a musical rom-com starring a then-skinny, ebony-haired postwar Elvis Presley. The Blue Hawaii is one of those iconic cocktails that encapsulates its namesake location every bit as the backdrop of Diamond Head volcano crater on Waikiki Beach. Now a modern take at the very location where the original was first mixed pays homage to its creator and to contemporary cocktail culture. The Blue Hawaii was created in 1957 at Honolulu’s Kaiser Hawaiian Village (now Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Resort ) by legendary head bartender Harry Yee. The story parallels that of the Moscow Mule , in which the genesis of the recipe was to promote and sell a boozy ingredient, in this case blue curaçao. A sales representative of Dutch distiller Bols asked Yee to design a drink that featured this shocking azure citrus liqueur. After experimenting with several different versions, he settled on one that shook (or blended, depending on guest preference) vodka, light rum, curaçao, pineapple juice and sweet-and-sour mix, served in a tall glass garnished with a pineapple and a cherry. The cocktail predates Hawaii’s statehood by two years, and it’s not Yee’s only claim to fame. “He’s also credited with being the first to add banana to a Daiquiri and is also remembered for his signature garnishes,” says Benjamin Lihn, the beverage director at Hilton Hawaiian Village. “My favorite is a unique and memorable wooden back scratcher to accompany the highly potent Tropical Itch.” But back to his timeless tipple, which made its way all over Oahu in versions that may stray far from the original. In September 2018, in honor of Yee’s hundredth birthday, the hotel hosted a reception for his friends and family, along with a bartending competition where a half-dozen local bartenders offered elevated variations on the classic. The Sea Blues is the Hilton Hawaiian Village’s own inspired take available at the property’s Bali Steak & Seafood. It starts with a base of Ocean vodka , which is distilled on Maui using organic sugar cane and deep ocean water, and mixed with Malibu coconut rum, Bols blue curaçao and freshly pressed lemon and pineapple juices. It’s presented over an ice sphere made with coconut water and cream of coconut in a glass rimmed with toasted coconut flakes and garnished with an orchid. As the ice melts, the drink takes on a creamy mellow flavor and silky texture that are both pretty irresistible. As Lihn says, “There’s nothing comparable to enjoying a Blue Hawaii (or any of its thoughtful incarnations) looking out over Waikiki’s widest stretch of beach and the place that started it all.” Mahalo, Yee.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Vodka'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coconut rum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Bols blue curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'wedge', 'ingredient': 'Lemon'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Coconut ice sphere'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'toasted coconut flakes', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible orchid', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'wedge', 'ingredient': 'pineapple'}]","['Rub the lemon wedge on the outside of a double Old Fashioned glass, coat in toasted coconut flakes and set aside.', 'Add the Ocean vodka, Malibu coconut rum, Bols Blue Curaçao, lemon juice and pineapple juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass over the coconut ice sphere (or a large ice sphere or cube).', 'Garnish with an edible orchid and pineapple wedge.']",17,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/harvey-wallbanger/,Harvey Wallbanger,Liquor.com,"The Harvey Wallbanger is a modern classic cocktail that was reportedly born in the 1950s, when it was first prepared by California bartender Donato “Duke” Antone. It’s basically a Screwdriver with the addition of Galliano, an Italian liqueur. The Harvey Wallbanger may have been invented in the ’50s (although that origin is debated), but it didn’t become a runaway sensation until the early 1970s. An import company’s marketing director, George Bednar, created an ad campaign that helped the drink fly off shelves as customers began to order it by name. Galliano is made with vanilla and a medley of herbs and spices, including star anise, juniper, lavender and cinnamon. It clocks in at 42.3% alcohol-by-volume, so it’s no slouch in the booze department, which means it doesn’t get lost in drinks. Still, most people know Galliano more for its tall, slender, bright yellow bottle than its flavor. But with its distinct taste, even small amounts can transform a cocktail. That’s evident in the Harvey Wallbanger, which is notably different from the Screwdriver despite the scant half ounce of Galliano used in the drink. The Harvey Wallbanger is a breeze to put together. You don’t even need a shaker; just build it right in the glass. The vodka and orange juice go in first, and the Galliano is floated on top.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/screwdriver/,Screwdriver,Liquor.com,"The Screwdriver is a classic combination of vodka and orange juice that has been designated an International Bartender Association official cocktail. The history of the Screwdriver is somewhat debatable, even though mention of it in literature goes back to at least 1940s, when vodka was first gaining traction in the United States. Though uncomplicated, the Screwdriver is one of the most well-known highballs ever created. To this day, it remains one of the first cocktail recipes many ever learn, and countless people's introduction to mixed drinks. Who Invented the Screwdriver Cocktail? The Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails places the drink's inception around the time of World War II when American civilians and servicemen abroad, unable to find a steady supply of familiar spirits like whiskey, took to cutting neutral spirits and Turkish vodka with orange juice to make them more palaptable. The drink gained visibility as vodka brands like Smirnoff, seeking to gain a foothold in the U.S. market, began to incorporate the Screwdriver cocktail into marketing campaigns over the following decades. The origins of the Screwdriver's name are less clear. One commonly repeated story is that the name resulted from factory workers stirring the drink with a screwdriver when a spoon couldn't be found, though little evidence can be found to support this. Coincidentally, a similar story exists about the etymology of the word ""cocktail"" itself—from early iterations that were allegedly stirred with a rooster's tail feather—as well as the Rusty Nail supposedly being stirred with, well, a rusty nail. If true, this all begs the question of why so many people throughout drinking history had such a tough time finding spoons. Everything You Need to Know About the Drinks That Could Save Your Morning RELATED ARTICLE Questionable origin stories aside, the cocktail's two-ingredient simplicity means it’s possible the drink appeared in multiple places around the same time, as people took to adding orange juice to whatever spirit they could find. After all, the Mimosa (sparkling wine and orange juice) had already been in rotation for a couple of decades by then, and it’s not a far stretch from sparkling wine to vodka.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/amaretto-sour/,Amaretto Sour,Dylan Garret,"The Amaretto Sour is thought to have first originated in the 1970s as a promotional push from liqueur brand Disaronno , then known as Amaretto di Saronno. It's a take on the classic sour template of drinks—those that include a spirit combined with sweet and sour elements—that's unique for a few reasons. While most sours use a base spirit paired with syrup or a liqueur for sweetness, balanced with fresh lemon or lime juice, the original Amaretto sour only required two ingredients: amaretto and lemon juice. This is because amaretto itself provided ample sugar to balance the citrus, filling the part of both base spirit and sweetener. Unfortunately, as the drink aged through the 1980s and '90s, prefabricated artificial ""sour mix"" began to replace fresh lemon and sugar in high-volume bars across the globe. While these mixers did a disservice to many classic Sour cocktails, they were especially detrimental to the Amaretto Sour, creating a double dose of sugar that led the cocktail to be associated with a super saccharine profile. However, modern bartenders have since rehabilitated the drink, finding ways to keep the spirit of the original almond- and marzipan-forward cocktail, while shaping it toward modern tastes. What Makes the Amaretto Sour Work Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that’s typically flavored with almonds or apricot stones. Its distinctive profile can be incorporated into numerous cocktails, but notes of deep cherry and toasted nuts lend themselves particularly well to cocktails (like the Sour) which benefit from both depth and sweetness. To further improve the classic Amaretto Sour, Portland, Oregon, bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler uses fresh lemon juice and high-proof bourbon to round out the cocktail, plus egg white for a dash of body and a silky texture. Egg white may seem unusual, but it’s a traditional addition to many sours, including the Whiskey Sour and Pisco Sour. Morgenthaler’s take is magic. The relatively small amount of high-proof bourbon doesn’t overshadow the amaretto, but instead bolsters the liqueur, allowing it to present strongly alongside tart citrus. Frothy, sweet, sour, nutty and packing a punch, these minor changes create a more balanced cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/full-monte/,Full Monte,Liquor.com,"When made with good whiskey, high-quality vermouth and bitters, the Manhattan is an unimpeachable classic, revered by drinkers since it first appeared at New York City’s Manhattan Club around 1880. Like many old-school winners, the cocktail has resulted in many twists. But one of those variations simply flips the typical 2:1 whiskey-to-vermouth ratio on its head, giving vermouth the spotlight. When you swap the ingredients in a Manhattan , “the other component shines through, and it unveils a more rich, aromatic and almost spicy component,” says Jenelle Engleson, a beverage director and sommelier in Nashville. She skips vermouth entirely in her Full Monte cocktail, choosing instead to pair rye whiskey with Amaro Montenegro. This Italian liqueur dates back to 1885 and is made from a secret blend of 40 botanicals, which coalesce into a predominate flavor of orange peels, florals and spice. Engleson appreciates Amaro Montenegro’s relatively low 23% ABV and its spicy profile, finding that it creates a balanced Manhattan variation that is as breezy to make as it is to drink. Given the rise of amari at bars around the world, and drinkers collectively acquiring a taste for digestifs, the Full Monte is a friendly option that will fall right into the comfort zone for many stirred-cocktail aficionados. The Reverse Manhattan (and similar drinks that dial up the vermouth or amaro while dialing down the full-proof spirit) isn’t a new concept. This approach was common in the 19th-century when vermouth featured prominently in drinks, including in the Manhattan, whose formula leaned heavier on the vermouth than today’s recipe.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/reverse-manhattan/,Reverse Manhattan,Kevin Gray,"Popular legend pegs the Manhattan’s invention to New York City’s Manhattan Club around 1880. Shortly after its debut, it became one of America’s most popular drinks, and it’s easy to see why: The timeless mix of American whiskey and Italian vermouth, accented with a couple dashes of bitters, is well-balanced and tasty. All these decades later, it’s still in high demand. Like any classic cocktail, the Manhattan has spurred many riffs, including other drinks named for NYC boroughs and neighborhoods, like the Brooklyn, Bronx and Red Hook, which call on other spirits and liqueurs. But one riff, the Reverse Manhattan, simply reverses the typical 2:1 whiskey-to-vermouth ratio and makes vermouth the star. Though vermouth is mainly used today as a modifier, Justin Lavenue, the co-owner and operator of The Roosevelt Room in Austin, points out that it was poured more liberally in the mid-to-late 1800s. That includes in Manhattans, as 19th-century drinkers were likely to have enjoyed a recipe that featured equal parts whiskey and vermouth, or possibly more vermouth than whiskey. “In a lot of ways, the Reverse Manhattan is an homage to how people used to drink vermouth and an homage to the genesis of cocktails as a whole,” he says. “If balanced correctly, [it] can be a wildly delicious drink.” Of course, the quality of the vermouth counts here. Rather than relying on one bottle to do all the work, Lavenue enlists three high-quality Italians—Cocchi Vermouth di Torino, Punt e Mes and Carpano Antica Formula—in precise ratios. You don’t have to combine your vermouths, but Lavenue’s recipe yields a blend that is rich and herbal with a hint of bitterness, and it stands tall next to the rye whiskey. The next time you want a Manhattan, try this about-face version. The Reverse Manhattan is a recognizable take on the classic that brings all the flavor with less of the alcohol, so it’s a great option for starting or ending your evening with a lighter-than-usual whiskey drink. 5 Modern Takes on the Reverse Manhattan RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth blend'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'marasca cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the sweet vermouth blend, rye whiskey and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a marasca cherry.']",48,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/deshler/,Deshler,Alex Frane,"The Deshler is a pre-Prohibition cocktail that first appeared in print in Hugo R. Ensllin’s 1917 “Recipes for Mixed Drinks.” According to the brand Cointreau, it was the first cocktail created with the orange liqueur in New York City. So it’s fitting that this slight twist on the original version of the recipe is from New York City bartender and self-proclaimed “Tiki pirate” Brian Miller , the founder of the once celebrated but now-closed Tiki bar the Polynesian . But this spirit-forward, rye whiskey-based drink would never be mistaken for a Tiki cocktail even if it were served in a fish-shaped mug. A stirred cocktail that draws from whiskey classics like the Manhattan and Sazerac , the Deshler is a sophisticated drink that is sure to win over those who love a darker, more spirit-forward cocktail. Like a Manhattan, the Deshler adds a bit of fortified wine to its rye whiskey. However, rather than a standard sweet vermouth, it specifically calls for Dubonnet rouge. This aromatic aperitif is well over a century old, dating back to 19th-century France. Like sweet vermouth, it’s fortified and flavored with botanicals, but includes quinine, the same bitter herb that gives tonic water its telltale sharpness. There’s no real substitution for Dubonnet rouge in the Deshler, but if pressed you could use Lillet Rouge or Byrrh, which are somewhat similar aperitifs. A splash of Cointreau adds a touch more sweetness and some citrusy depth, while two dashes of Peychaud’s bitters add even more botanicals as well as a deeper crimson hue. In the recipe’s original formulation, the rye whiskey and Dubonnet rouge were called for in equal amounts, plus two dashes of Cointreau and two of Peychaud’s. Here, the rye and Dubonnet are in the two-to-one proportions of a standard Manhattan. The two dashes of Peychaud's remain, while the Cointreau is cranked up slightly for a more pronounced fruity flavor. The result is strong and elegant, and may overtake the Manhattan as your favorite late-night cocktail.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dubonnet rouge'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': ""Peychaud's bitters""}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add rye whiskey, Dubonnet rouge, Cointreau and Peychaud’s bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an orange twist.']",14,whiskey

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-bee-sting/,Bee Sting,Liquor.com,"Scotch drinks tend to be more uncommon than other, more ubiquitous whiskey-based drinks using, say, bourbon or rye. One of the most famous, besides the Blood & Sand , is the Rusty Nail , a two-to-one combination of scotch (blended or single malt) and Drambuie, a sweet, scotch-based herbal liqueur. The Bee Sting, from bartending veteran Jonathan Pogash, is a bit like a cross between a Rusty Nail and a scotch sour. In it, Laphroaig—a lauded single malt whisky from the storm-lashed Scottish island of Islay —is mixed with Bärenjäger , a German honey liqueur. Its name translates to Bear Hunter, as it is reportedly based on an 18th century German recipe used to lure bears (and has no relationship to Jägermeister, which means Master Hunter). Sweet, botanical and rich, Bärenjäger adds considerable complexity to the already layered scotch whisky, and pairs with it in a similar fashion as Drambuie does in the Rusty Nail. To add even more botanicals, Pogash uses a quarter-ounce of Fernet-Branca . This Italian digestif has long been associated as a bartender’s drink, especially in San Francisco where it first caught on as a trend. Botanical, minty and bittersweet, it is both a great after-dinner libation as well as an ingredient in cocktails like the Bee Sting. Rather than use the more familiar lemon or lime juice, or even orange, Pogash uses tangerine juice, which adds a nice balance of sweetness and tartness. That acidity is mellowed a bit by egg white, which add a silky, creamy mouthfeel to the drink. If the egg white is fresh and properly shaken (that is, a dry shake before being shaken again with ice), there should be a thick layer of white foam on top of the finished drink. A few dashes of Peychaud’s bitters add both bright aromatics as well as a lovely visual.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rusty-nail/,Rusty Nail,Dale DeGroff,"For decades, one of the hottest cocktails was the Rusty Nail. But after a good run, the simple combination of scotch and the scotch-based liqueur Drambuie, a word derived from Gaelic meaning “the drink that satisfies,” has fallen off most bar menus and is rarely ordered by patrons. Just as mystifying as its disappearance was its appearance in the first place. The lineage of the potent after-dinner libation is contested, with many believing it was invented in 1937 for the British Industries Fair trade show. It does appear in the 1967 edition of Old Mister Boston Official Bartender’s Guide , the cocktail book of record through the post-Prohibition 20th century. (A similar drink, dubbed the Little Club #1, is included in Ted Saucier’s 1951 Bottoms Up .) By the late 1960s, bars in New Orleans and New York were serving the concoction, and “Have you tried a Rusty Nail?” was a common refrain. The Rusty Nail is often credited to the clever bartenders at the 21 Club in Manhattan sometime in the early 1960s. It makes sense, being that the establishment created the famous B & B—half Bénédictine and half cognac—as well. It’s easy to imagine that the talented crew applied the same formula to another cordial and liquor, but I haven’t been able to substantiate that claim. Lore has it that the Rat Pack was enamored with the drink, which may have been responsible for the wide appeal in those years. In the 1970s, I mixed many a Rusty Nail at the joints I worked at in New York. They were also a hit at P.J. Clarke’s, a favorite late-night haunt of Frank Sinatra. The Comeback of the Disco Drink: Which Vintage Cocktails Deserve to Be Saved? RELATED ARTICLE How to Make a Rusty Nail As with lots of classics, the recipe varies widely. Ted Haigh, the author of Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails , likes two parts scotch to one part Drambuie; Old Mister Boston calls for a one-to-one ratio; and many modern versions are far drier, with some suggesting four parts whisky to one part liqueur. You could also substitute bourbon for scotch and get a Rusty Spike. But the Rusty Nail is a classic for a reason, and the two-to-one ratio will always be a fine example of the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-bottom-line/,The Bottom Line,Liquor.com,"Often when making a scotch cocktail like a Blood & Sand or Rob Roy , you’ll want to reach for one of the middle shelves, grabbing something blended or in the younger range of single malts. Otherwise, you risk making a drink that would cost upwards of $40 at a bar. But sometimes it can be a lot of fun, albeit pricey fun, to grab a premium scotch and make a drink with it. That’s what San Francisco bar pro Kevin Diedrich did with The Bottom Line—in it, Highland Park 18-year-old takes center stage. This smoky, complex spirit comes from the Orkney Islands off the northern tip of Scotland, and in this drink it serves as a deeply complex and bold base, standing up to the other ingredients and coming through strong. The bottom line is that any whisky lover should try this smoky, layered drink at least once. If you don’t end up caring for it, at least you’ll have a fine bottle of scotch on hand for sipping. Besides the aforementioned whisky, Diedrich includes a number of ingredients not as commonly used in cocktails. Manzanilla sherry mixes remarkably well with scotch, and here it adds its distinct nuttiness and salinity to the drink . Bärenjäger honey liqueur (unrelated to Jägermeister) adds sweetness, and Amaro CioCiaro lends a bittersweet botanical layer. The amaro can be difficult to find in some areas—substituting another amaro like Amer Picon or Ramazzotti could potentially work, but the flavor profile will be slightly different. Equal parts orange and Angostura bitters round the drink out, like how salt and pepper finishes a dish. Another thing to keep in mind is that each of these ingredients contains alcohol, which means The Bottom Line is a very strong drink. A few too many of these and your hangover the next day may be the real bottom line. Besides, if you’re using such an expensive whisky, it’s probably best to keep it to the occasional indulgence rather than mixing multiples batches in a night.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/campbeltown/,Campbeltown,Liquor.com,"While scotch is often relegated to a few drinks like the Rob Roy or Penicillin , there are multitudes of use for the family of whiskies. Leave it to bars in Scotland, then, to come up with some. The Campbeltown comes from Bramble Bar & Lounge in Edinburgh, a moody, stylish spot that often makes its way onto lists of the world’s best cocktail bars. With a single malt whisky as its base, this stirred drink has bold, deep flavors for those who like their drinks strong yet nuanced. The Campbeltown is not a cheap drink to make. It begins with Springbank 10-year-old-scotch, a well-balanced whisky with a $100 price tag. Besides giving the drink its bold smokiness and depth, it also gives the cocktail its name, as the Springbank distillery is located in Campbeltown. The single malt scotch has the depth and richness to stand up to the drink’s green Chartreuse, a famous herbal liqueur made by Carthusian monks with a secret recipe. While not as expensive as the Springbank 10-year-old, it’s still a pricey spirit, averaging $50 a bottle. Luckily, the drink only calls for half-an-ounce of it, and the Chartreuse can also be used in cocktails like the Last Word , Bijou and a number of others. The third element of this botanical, spirit-forward cocktail is Cherry Heering, a sweet and tart cherry liqueur. One of its most well-known uses is in another scotch cocktail, the Blood & Sand . Other cherry liqueurs on the market, most famously maraschino liqueur, tend to be less sweet than Heering, so if you plan on substituting one of them be sure to taste for sweetness. You can always add a touch of simple syrup, if need be. If the price tag per drink is intimidating, you could substitute a more affordable scotch. Blended whiskies often work well in mixed drinks and generally have a lower price tag, while another bold single malt could handle the green Chartreuse. However, the flavor profile is balanced around the Springbank, so any change could lead to an inferior drink. Plus, the name wouldn’t fit anymore, though that’s less of a concern.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/scottish-beats/,Scottish Beats,Liquor.com,"The Blood & Sand is a classic drink, yet it’s an uncommon kind of cocktail—while most whiskey-based drinks use bourbon or rye, the Blood & Sand is one of the rare few that use scotch whisky. Though a somewhat divisive drink, it has its adherents, as well as its fans who enjoy playing with the formula. This variation on the cocktail comes from Jason Percival, the former bar manager at the now-closed Post 390 in Boston. The Scottish Beats is even more unorthodox than the original model, as it swaps out the orange juice for sweet vermouth and, oddly, beet juice. Like any good whisky drink, the quality of the Scottish Beats relies on its base spirit. However, because it gets a number of other ingredients, including orange liqueur and beets, there’s no reason to splurge on expensive, aged single malts. A blended whisky like Johnnie Walker’s red or black labels or an affordable single malt should do the trick. By far the most unusual component in this cocktail, and what makes it a unique concoction, is the use of beet puree. Steaming the beets before letting them cool and peeling them is the best way to go about it. Much of the sweetness in the cocktails comes from Cherry Heering, a Scandinavian cherry liqueur. If you choose to substitute another cherry liqueur in its place, like maraschino liqueur, be sure to taste for sweetness before serving as the Heering tends to be on the sweeter side of things. Keep in mind, too, that the liqueur adds some of the deep red color that defines the drink. The color, sweetness and botanicals of the drink are also bumped up by the addition of sweet vermouth, while Cointreau (or another good orange liqueur if need be) adds brightness and the necessary orange element that normally comes in the form of freshly squeezed juice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/scotch-and-soda/,Scotch & Soda,Jordan Mackay,"When I was in my early 20s, living in Austin and still a relatively inexperienced drinker, I had a slightly older friend who favored Scotch & Soda. Upon entering one of his usual haunts, this commanding fellow would bark, “Two Dewar’s & Sodas with a twist.” I would sip mine, even though I despised the wan, punchless, boring, watery concoction. Fast-forward 15 years, and I’m fixing a Whiskey & Soda nightly—and loving it. What happened? Is it just my old-man-ification? I don’t think so. Instead, I believe I’ve come to appreciate the subtle art of dilution and the sweetness, the liveliness and the sheer drinkability that a little bit of water can bring to an otherwise pure and complex spirit. It turns out my newfound predilection for Scotch & Soda has scientific heft. “Aroma molecules are also more chemically similar to alcohol molecules than they are to water, so they tend to cling to alcohol, and are quicker to evaporate out of a drink when there’s less alcohol to cling to,” wrote food scientist Harold McGee in The New York Times. “Add water and there’s less alcohol to irritate and burn, and more aroma release.” To my mouth, the liquor’s flavor emerges in a way that doesn’t batter the tongue. The bubbles make the mixture quaffable and refreshing, especially suited for a sticky August evening. I don’t use a prized single malt or rare bourbon, but rather a good-quality, high-intensity blend like Pig’s Nose scotch or a midrange bourbon like Bulleit. The chunkier the spirit, the better it works. Be sure to find whiskeys in which the toast and woodiness is balanced by the fruity sweetness of malt or grain. I prefer a ratio of two parts soda to one part whiskey, which can carry you through a whole night—the buzz of the Scotch & Soda builds slowly and is easy to maintain at a gentle, humming level. If only I’d understood that 15 years ago. 6 Highballs to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'scotch'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the scotch to a highball glass filled with ice.', 'Top with club soda and stir briefly to combine.', 'Garnish with an optional lemon twist.']",179,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/harvest-time/,Harvest Time,Liquor.com,"Both locations of RedFarm are local New York City go-tos for hip dim sum and a red-and-white-checkered farmhouse vibe. Beverage director and veteran bartender Shawn Chen designed the Harvest Time as a pleasing, warming cocktail for when autumn and winter come to The Big Apple.

It might even become your go-to hot drink for fall and winter revelry. For the boozy base, Chen would use BenRiach Curiositas, a peat-heavy scotch from Speyside. Any other single malt with a strong peat presence could also potentially work, so feel free to use what you have on hand—stick to the smokier scotch brands if you want to maintain the campfire vibes of the original recipe. To the scotch, Chen adds a small measure of Campari. This vivid red Italian liqueur is not commonly used in hot drinks or mixed with apple cider, but the small amount of it adds nuance and depth to the Harvest Time. Along with a house made ginger syrup (which is made with brown sugar for extra depth and richness), Chen also adds yuzu, an East Asian citrus fruit, for tartness and balance.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tart-n-sand/,Tart ’n’ Sand,Liquor.com,"The Blood & Sand is a classic cocktail that combines the seemingly disparate ingredients scotch, cherry brandy, sweet vermouth and orange juice. It first appeared in 1930 in “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ” by Harry Craddock, so the strange drink has stood the test of time because, somehow, it works. But once you’ve mastered the classic, it’s time to experiment with one of the many variations the Blood & Sand has spawned over the decades. That includes the Tart ’n’ Sand from bartender and brand ambassador Charlotte Voisey. The Tart ’n’ Sand begins where it should, with a good scotch . Voisey chooses Glenfiddich 12-year-old, a mellow and mixable single malt with notes of fresh pear and sweet, subtle oak. From there, she takes a few thoughtful liberties, subbing pink grapefruit juice and lemon juice for the orange juice and replacing sweet vermouth with Lillet rouge, a French wine-based aperitif. The orange isn’t completely lost, however, as Voisey enlists Solerno, a liqueur made with ripe Sanguinello blood oranges from Sicily. That covers all the bases, minus the cherry brandy. Voisey achieves this last flavor addition by mudding a handful of Luxardo marasca cherries in the shaker before adding the liquid components. The sweet and syrupy fruit adds a rich vein of cherry flavor to the cocktail and contributes to its gorgeous red hue. The Tart ’n’ Sand isn’t the classic version of the cocktail you’ll find on bar menus all over the world, but it’s worth sampling. With its blend of tart citrus, richly flavored orange liqueur and sweet cherries, it might even be better than the original. 9 Ways to Use Blood Oranges in Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Luxardo marasca cherries'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Glenfiddich 12-year-old single malt scotch whisky'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Solerno blood orange liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lillet Rouge aperitif'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pink grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the cherries.', 'Add the scotch, blood orange liqueur, Lillet rouge, pink grapefruit juice, lemon juice and orange bitters into the shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass or a coupe.', 'Garnish with an orange wheel.']",0,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whiskey-sour/,Whiskey Sour,Dylan Garret,"Spirit, citrus and sugar are the trinity that combine to form the classic sour, one of the oldest types of cocktails. One of the most popular members of this group, the Whiskey Sour, has sated thirsty drinkers for more than one and a half centuries. It’s unknown exactly when the cocktail was conceived (or who was the architect), but its history stretches back to at least the administration of Abraham Lincoln, and the first printed recipe appeared circa 1862 in Jerry Thomas's famed book The Bar-Tenders Guide . The Whiskey Sour was traditionally made with whiskey, lemon juice, sugar and egg white, an ingredient that tames the tart flavor and creates a richer, smoother texture. Today the egg is optional, and it’s often more common to find bars serving Whiskey Sours without egg white. But if you want to taste the original incarnation of the drink, and put a little protein in your system, give it a try. When using egg white, you’ll want to perform a “dry shake,” meaning to shake all the ingredients without ice before shaking again with fresh ice. This incorporates the ingredients together while aerating the egg, akin to making a meringue. It creates a fuller-bodied drink with a more luxurious mouthfeel. What's a Sour Cocktail? ""Sours"" are a broad category of cocktails that generally denote any drink comprised of a base spirit balanced with sugar (usually in the form of simple syrup, but also including liqueurs, honey, agave syrup, and others) and citric acid (most commonly lemon or lime juice). Despite their name, these drinks aren't always actually sour in flavor, and ratios can change the drink to make sweeter or more spirit forward concoctions. Still, many of the world's most popular drinks fall under this umbrella. When used as a general modifier after the name of a spirit, such as Gin Sour, the default formulation has historically meant the inclusion of lemon juice and sugar, compacted by the creation of mass-produced ""sour mix"" in the 20th century—in effect an (often poor) attempt at making a shelf-stable approximation of fresh lemon juice and sugar. However, as many spirit categories have developed their own signature versions of the sour template (like the Pisco Sour , with its lime and bitters), the term now often denotes drinks with more specific specifications. Variations on the Whiskey Sour Few drinks in the cocktail canon are as quick to satisfy as a sour, and the basic template has created an entire category of cocktails that include everything from the Daiquiri to the Margarita , Mai Tai , Sidecar , and countless more. Even the humble lemonade employs the sour template of acid-plus-sugar, albeit generally sweetened more heavily. But the Whiskey Sour itself has spawned many more specific whiskey-based variations, like the red wine-topped New York Sour , or honey-forward Gold Rush . As long as you follow this three-part template, almost any similar component can be swapped in to create instant, well-balanced refreshment. For a classic Whiskey Sour, bourbon is a fantastic option, thickened with egg white and topped with a few dashes of aromatic bitters for a complementary spice note. Follow that format, and you can’t go wrong. However, one of the best things about the sour is that it’s highly customizable. Translation: You do you.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kentucky-flyer/,Kentucky Flyer,Liquor.com,"The Kentucky Flyer was created by bartender Sierra Zimei in 2011, when she was working at the Four Seasons in San Francisco. It’s a variation on the classic Aviation cocktail, which dates back to the early 20th century and combines gin, maraschino liqueur, crème de violette and fresh lemon juice. Named for the state’s reputation as a whiskey powerhouse, the Kentucky Flyer features rye whiskey, maraschino liqueur and lemon juice. It skips the crème de violette, a practice that was also common among Aviation-makers for decades, considering that this violet-hued liqueur disappeared from the market in the 1960s and remained unavailable (in the United States, at least) until 2007. While many cocktails take years or even decades to get their due, Zimei’s Kentucky Flyer was an instant hit. Locals gravitated to the well-balanced drink, and bar legend and author Gary Regan included it on his list of the 101 Best New Cocktails of 2011, helping to spread the word among bartenders and enthusiasts. Make a Kentucky Flyer for yourself, and you will quickly see the appeal. The rye and lemon combination is strong and tart, with its Whiskey Sour vibes accented by the maraschino liqueur’s bittersweet cherry notes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/aviation/,Aviation,Kevin Gray,"The Aviation is a classic gin cocktail dating back to the turn of the 20th century, and it first appeared in Huge Enslinn’s book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” in 1916 while he was tending bar at New York City’s Hotel Wallick. In the ensuing decades, it was all but forgotten. That’s because one of the drink’s primary ingredients, crème de violette liqueur, disappeared from the market during the 1960s. In 2007, Minneapolis importer Haus Alpenz began importing Rothman & Winter crème de violette from Austria right at the height of the craft cocktail renaissance. The liqueur’s newfound availability led to the Aviation reappearing on bar menus across the United States market, as bartenders rediscovered this classic recipe. The Aviation combines gin, maraschino liqueur and fresh lemon juice alongside that crème de violette, creating a unique, floral cocktail. Gin provides a sturdy base, while maraschino liqueur lends its trademark bittersweet cherry notes and lemon adds necessary acidity. Crème de violette is exceedingly flower-like, so it’s important to use it sparingly and measure your ingredients. Too much, and your Aviation will taste like a bowl of potpourri. Beyond Rothman & Winter’s bottle, you can also try Creme Yvette, a historic liqueur that was revived in 2009, 40 years after production stopped. It’s made from parma violet petals and also features blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, orange peel, honey and vanilla. Brands including The Bitter Truth and Giffard also now offer violet liqueurs that work well in the Aviation. Some will argue that you can’t make a proper Aviation without the violet-hued liqueur. However, during its absence, the Aviation continued to find favor among enterprising drinkers who simply made the drink without it. This was likely fueled in part by “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” in which author Harry Craddock included a violette-less Aviation in his 1930 tome. That makes an interesting drink to be sure, but if you want to taste the original recipe, you need the purple stuff. Regardless of which brand you choose, let’s hope that at least one of these examples sticks around. That way, consumers will never again have to live in a world without crème de violette.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whiskey-sour-3/,Ward III Whiskey Sour,Liquor.com,"The Whiskey Sour is a gold standard of sours—a sweet, tart, and boozy mixture of whiskey, lemon juice and simple syrup. One way to add an additional complexity and a striking visual appeal to the drink is to make it a New York Sour . This century-plus-old variation on the traditional sour is a simple one: The drink is finished with a crimson float of red wine. That’s how bartender Kenneth McCoy made the standard Whiskey Sour at New York City’s now-shuttered Ward III . McCoy was using Heaven Hill bourbon, a bottled-in-bond bourbon from Bardstown, Kentucky. McCoy found that the soft caramel notes of Heaven Hill bourbon could handle a little extra tartness, so he adjusted the typical proportions in the drink from equal parts citrus and simple syrup to a bit heavy on the lemon side. And, as with a New York Sour, he added a red wine float using Chianti, a relatively high-acid red wine. The balance in this drink is also helped by the inclusion of egg whites. They provide a beautiful layer of foam—which is created in part by dry-shaking the drink with no ice before shaking again with ice. But the egg whites also add richness and a silky mouthfeel that can smooth some of the sharper, more acerbic edges of the citrus juice and tart red wine. To really step up the visuals of the drink, it’s possible to pour the red wine carefully down the back of a bar spoon whose tip is just under the layer of egg white foam. When poured, it should settle and float under the foam, creating a vivid red band between the lush brown drink and the white foam. Don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t come out right the first time. As with any bartending trick, it can take many tries to master. That just means more opportunities to experience McCoy’s balanced, intriguing take on this classic. 6 Things You Should Know About the Whiskey Sour RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'red wine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and egg white to a shaker and dry-shake (without ice) vigorously for 30 seconds.', 'Add ice and shake again until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain using a hand-held strainer into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Gently float the wine on top by drizzling it over the back of a bar spoon.', 'Garnish with a skewered maraschino cherry and orange wheel.']",27,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/irish-maid/,Irish Maid,Liquor.com,"The Kentucky Maid was created by Sam Ross, the acclaimed New York bartender formerly of legendary hotspot Milk & Honey who is also responsible for modern classics like the Penicillin and the Paper Plane . The drink features bourbon, lime juice, simple syrup, mint and cucumber and is a refreshing way to quench thirsts—and kill time. After its debut, the Kentucky Maid kicked off a versatile family of cocktails, in which a base spirit is combined with fresh, seasonal ingredients, including cucumber. Sub gin for bourbon, and you have a London Maid. Use Irish whiskey, and you’re now face-to-face with the Irish Maid. The Irish Maid is similar to a Whiskey Smash , which calls for muddling lemon wedges in a shaker before combining the remaining ingredients: whiskey, sugar and mint. The Irish Maid, though, calls for muddling cucumber slices to release their fresh juices before shaking the remaining ingredients—St-Germain elderflower liqueur, citrus and simple syrup—with ice and straining the contents into a rocks glass. The cocktail is floral and refreshing. With its burst of aromatics and the cooling touch of cucumber, it makes a convincing case for whiskey as a summer drink. Serve the Irish Maid to guests at your next backyard barbecue or enjoy it by yourself on a warm afternoon.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/midnight-special/,Midnight Special,Liquor.com,"Whiskey is a versatile spirit. It can be employed in all-liquor drinks like the Manhattan and Old Fashioned or paired with citrus, soda, berries and more. There’s not a lot it can’t do, which makes it ripe for experimentation. Just take a look at the Midnight Special. This cocktail by Camille Cavan, the bar manager at Portland, Oregon’s Quaintrelle , recalls the tart sweetness of a Whiskey Sour with the subtle bitterness of a Boulevardier (bourbon, Campari, sweet vermouth) or an Old Pal (rye, Campari, dry vermouth). The drink begins with a bourbon base. Dark and nutty Oloroso sherry provides structure, and Tempus Fugit Gran Classico brings a bitter touch. Made from a maceration of 25 aromatic herbs and roots including wormwood, gentian, orange peel and rhubarb, Gran Classico is a departure in flavor from bright-red Campari. But it works similarly to how Campari impacts a Boulevardier: by lending a bitter herbaceous note to the cocktail. Fresh lemon juice and simple syrup supply balance, and—when combined with egg white—continue the Whiskey Sour comparisons. But the egg white is used differently than in the typical sour. Rather than being added to the shaker and combined with all the other components, it’s shaken by itself and deployed as a topper. The frothy head acts as a base for the drops of black walnut bitters, which provide their nutty aromas with each sip. In the end, this is a citrus-forward drink, rounded out with rich sherry and bitter aperitif. It’s reminiscent of a classic Whiskey Sour, but it charts a path that is all its own. Mix one the next time you want a drink that is new and complex, but familiar. 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Tempus Fugit Gran Classico'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'bitters', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all the ingredients except the egg white to a shaker with ice and shake vigorously.', 'Fine-strain into a rocks glass over 1 large ice cube.', 'Add the egg white to an empty shaker and dry-shake without ice for about 10 seconds, and pour over the cocktail.', 'Garnish with a few drops of black walnut bitters.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gaelic-flip/,Gaelic Flip,Liquor.com,"While eggs are far from uncommon ingredients in cocktails, it’s mostly limited to egg whites in drinks like sours, which help balance those drinks’ sweet and acidic qualities. But the flip is a historic family of drinks that uses the whole egg, along with a spirit and some kind of sweetener, and it’s this simple blueprint that the Gaelic Flip is based on. From Chicago bartender Charles Joly—the founder of Crafthouse Cocktails , a line of bottled cocktails—the drink uses Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth and a mix of allspice liqueur and simple syrup for sweetness. The result is a foamy, rich and silky drink that, when made right, is as stunning to look at as it is to drink. Joly uses Bushmills in his recipe, a popular brand of Irish whiskey. Affordable and reliable, it is a solid and sumptuous base for the Gaelic Flip. Using other brands like Jamesons, Powers or Tullamore DEW is acceptable as well. However, considering how much the whiskey will get muted with allspice and egg, it’s best to avoid using something too pricey. Instead, save the expensive Irish whiskeys for sipping, or at least use them in a more spirit-forward cocktail like a Tipperary or an Irish Old Fashioned . Even more so than with an egg white drink, a flip benefits from what’s known in the industry as a dry shake. For that, simply build the cocktail as normal in the shaker, but omit the ice for the time being. After a vigorous shaking to build up the foam, add the ice and shake again until well-chilled, and double strain using a handheld strainer into your awaiting chilled vessel. If properly crafted, the drink should have a thick layer of foam on top, one that will act as a buoyant pillow for the freshly grated nutmeg to rest on. Why Is There a Whole Egg in my Drink?

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/moscow-mule-cocktail-recipe/,Moscow Mule,Liquor.com,"The Moscow Mule is a classic combination of vodka, ginger beer, and lime. Known for it's iconic copper mug, the drink's enduring popularity has left it as a mainstay in bars since the mid-20th century. Despite its name, the Moscow Mule was actually invented in Los Angeles as part of an early stateside marketing push for vodka, and the drink itself is considered an example of the Buck family of drinks—those that include a spirit with citrus and ginger beer. The History of the Moscow Mule The Moscow Mule is a mid-century classic that was born in 1941 and helped contribute to vodka’s rise in America. As the legend goes , it was concocted by two men. John Martin needed to sell Smirnoff vodka, a new and generally unknown spirit during the middle of the 20th century that his distribution company had recently purchased. Another man, bar owner Jack Morgan, wanted to deplete the stash of ginger beer taking up space at his Cock ‘n’ Bull pub. They decided to combine the two ingredients with a little lime, and the rest is history. (Though there is a conflicting origin story that says that a bartender by the name of Wes Price was the true originator of the cocktail’s recipe.) The origin of the Moscow Mule mug is slightly less clear, though evidence points to the connection originating with a Russian woman named Sophie Berezinski, who's father owned copper factory called Moscow Copper Co. Allegedly, poor sales in their home country left the younger Berezinski to travel to the U.S. to find new buyers. As historian David Wondrich observes, the copper mugs reached Cock 'n' Bull and were used to create a visually distinct presentation for the new cocktail, helped along by Martin who took Polaroid instant photos (then a recent invention) of Los Angeles bartenders and guests holding the copper mugs alongside bottles of Smirnoff. The photos were displayed throughout the bar and given to patrons to share, almost in the same vein as modern social media influencers. As the photos proliferated throughout the Los Angeles cocktail community, it helped to spur demand for the novel drink. Regardless of how the drink was invented, the easygoing combination of vodka, spicy ginger and tart lime—all packaged neatly in an eye-catching mug—was a hit. More than a quarter century later, the Moscow Mule remains a star. It has even spawned variations, like the Mezcal Mule with mezcal and the Kentucky Mule with bourbon. The 12 Best Ginger Beers for Your Home Bar RELATED ARTICLE Why the Moscow Mule Works The simple cocktail combines vodka with ginger beer and fresh lime juice. It’s a no-tools-required drink that is built right in that shiny copper mug. Of course, while said mug is always preferred for serving, it’s not essential and shouldn’t deter you from making a Moscow Mule. The drink tastes great no matter the receptacle. So if a highball glass or rocks glass is all you have on hand, don’t fret. Any preferred vodka will work nicely in the mule, but high-quality ginger beer is a must. You want a top-notch option that and offers enough of a spicy bite to complement the liquor and lime. And keep that bottle cold before you employ it your Moscow Mule. Cold keeps the bubbles brisk and helps stall dilution when you mix all the drink’s ingredients. This recipe brings the legendary drink up to date while remaining true to its refreshing roots. At its core, the Moscow Mule is deceptively simple and incredibly easy to mix, perfect for any season.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/audrey-saunders-ginger-beer/,Ginger Beer,Kara Newman,"There are many different ways to make ginger beer, the bolder and often spicier cousin to the more well-known ginger ale. Some include naturally fermented and lightly alcoholic variations that can take weeks to fully develop, or industrialized versions that are more akin to a strongly flavored soft drink than a brewed beverage. This version from famed bar professional Audrey Saunders splits the difference, providing a ginger beer recipe that can be made and served on demand, while still providing a depth of profile and homemade flavor. At the now-closed New York cocktail oasis Pegu Club, proprietor Audrey Saunders’ Gin-Gin Mule rightfully earned a place in the modern-day cocktail canon. She described the famously gingery cocktail as a cross between a Moscow Mule (another ginger beer-based drink) and a Mojito (usually a rum drink but here made with gin). Gin-Gin Mule 48 ratings While this refreshing cocktail certainly can be made with store-bought ginger fizz, it is even better when mixed with something homemade. By creating a concentrated ginger beer base and mixing it with soda water to create effervescence, you have a combination that can come together from scratch in about an hour, and will keep refrigerated for up to two weeks. “Store-bought stuff has a peppery, more than gingery, profile,” says Saunders, interviewed in the book New York Cocktails (Cider Mill Press, $20) by Amanda Schuster. In addition, many brands can be “insipid,” she says. While Pegu Club made their ginger beer by the gallon, here’s a smaller-scale version to try at home. It takes a little time—note the one-hour wait for the ingredients to fully integrate.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/burgundy-and-gold/,Burgundy & Gold,Liquor.com,"Being a football fan and a bartender means at some point you might be obligated to craft a drink in honor of your favorite, hopefully hometown, team. That’s the case with the Burgundy & Gold from bartender Kevin Diedrich, co-owner of Pacific Cocktail Haven in San Francisco. While his bar is there, his team remains in Washington, D.C., and though it lost its problematic name, the team still retains the colors the drink is named for: burgundy and gold. “Being a Washington [football] fan in San Francisco is tough, as I imagine it is for any foreign fan in a city that’s not their own,” says Diedrich. The Burgundy & Gold is a playful take on the traditional Whiskey Sour , bolstered by tart kalamansi and balanced with a deep, fruity ruby port float. Rather than employing bourbon, Diedrich uses rye whiskey out of homage for the team’s home. “It... was one of the first spirits to be made in D.C.,” he says. Specifically, Diedrich uses one from Copper Fox Distillery, located in Sperryville, Virginia, about an hour and a half outside of D.C. If that bottle is not available in your area, you can substitute another American rye whiskey. Far more unusual than using rye for bourbon, though, is replacing some of the lemon juice traditionally included in a Whiskey Sour recipe with kalamansi puree. The diminutive, green-skinned and yellow-fleshed citrus fruit is native to the Philippines and other areas of the Pacific Islands and Southeast Asia, and is often referred to as a Philippine lime or lemon. The yellow flesh gives the cocktail its signature golden hue, as well as tart, floral body. For the burgundy portion of the Burgundy & Gold, Diedrich takes a page out of the New York Sour book and finishes the drink with a red wine float. And rather than a more familiar red wine, say one from Burgundy, he uses port. The fortified wine imparts a dark ruby hue and a gentle sweetness, which is aided by a touch of pomegranate molasses. While the drink works fine in any rocks glass, there’s always room for more gold to complete the image. “A gold-rimmed glass is a plus,” Diedrich says.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rub-rye/,Rub & Rye,Liquor.com,"When it comes to backyard summertime drinking there are plenty of options, from the Mint Julep to all manner of Shandy variations. The Rub & Rye, from bartending expert Francesco Lafranconi, is a summery drink that eschews a usual approach in favor of a unique one. It evokes the flavors of a beer-fueled barbecue cookout, and is finished with beef jerky to drive the flavors home. It balances salty and sweet, boozy and refreshing for a drink that will pair perfectly with your next summer grill. This tall, foamy concoction starts with rye whiskey, and while the recipe calls for Bulleit, use whichever rye you like best. With lemon juice, egg white and maple syrup rather than simple syrup, it’s essentially a maple Whiskey Sour —which is a solid start to a drink—but Lafranconi doesn’t stop there. He tops the concoction with five ounces of Belgian beer, in particular the Scaldis Pêche Mel, a strong peach ale. It might seem counterintuitive, but the subtle peach flavors along with the other ingredients evoke a sense of summertime revelry. However, if the peach puts you off, you can substitute with another Belgian ale. Be sure to stay on the brighter side, though, as an ale that is too dark and overly malty can throw off the other flavors. The drink also gets five drops of barbecue bitters, and for that ingredient there are not a lot of options. By far the most popular and available brand for them is the Bitter End, which produces the Memphis Barbecue bitters. Smoky and tangy, they mimic the flavors of Memphis-style barbecue, which is perfect for finishing the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/yard-sale/,Yard Sale,Liquor.com,"An après-ski drink has, over the years, evolved to be its own kind of loose category of cocktails. While there are no firm rules for what designates a drink an après-ski (other than the obvious factor of being served after a ski trip, normally in a lodge or cabin of some sort) they’re often served hot—like the consummate Hot Toddy . Others include heavily botanical spirits like alpine liqueurs while others still are strong, spirit-forward concoctions that warm you from the inside-out despite being served cold. Such is the Yard Sale, from Stephen Gill, the bar manager at Horn & Cantle Saloon at Lone Mountain Ranch in Big Sky, Montana. In ski jargon, a “yard sale” is when you wipe out on the mountain and your equipment (poles, skis, goggles) flies everywhere across the snow like items spread across a lawn at a yard sale. After such a tumble, with cold hands and wet hair, an après-ski is more necessary than ever, especially something strong. “What I want after skiing all day is something that goes straight to the face,” Gill says. “The whole premise of the drink is that it’ll give you the confidence to get back up after you yard-sale.” To make his high-octane concoction more Montana, Gill barrel-ages the finished cocktail for about three weeks. It’s served at the resort saloon but, he says, “it’s like a secret-menu kind of deal.” Gill doesn’t hold back with the spirits, using equal parts of three different base liquors: bourbon, rye whiskey and calvados (a French apple brandy)‚ as well as an equal part of sweet vermouth. While the recipe isn’t particular about the brand of liquors, the vermouth called for is Carpano Antica Formula , a pricey but widely respected Italian sweet vermouth. Others, like Punt e Mes or Dolin Rouge, are acceptable substitutes that won’t alter the flavor profile too much. Of course, most people don’t have empty barrels hanging around the house for a three-month aging stint. However, if you’re really serious about replicating the exact flavors of Gill’s boozy concoction, the best way to go about aging cocktails is to start with a liter-barrel.","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'calvados'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vermouth'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.', 'Garnish with a skewered lemon twist and Luxardo maraschino cherry.', 'Optional: barrel-age the entire completed cocktail for 3 weeks.']",14,bourbon

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/butter-and-smoke/,Butter & Smoke,Liquor.com,"Across the country, bartenders are using smoke to infuse their cocktails with more flavor. Smoke can be achieved by burning wood in a cocktail smoker , of course, but lighting stalky herbs like thyme, rosemary and lavender brings additional flavor to drinks. Plus, it’s a fun parlor trick for cocktail parties. The Butter & Smoke was created by Zachary Gross, the beverage director at Sen Sakana , a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant in New York City. To make it, he utilizes thyme smoke alongside pumpkin butter-infused bourbon, cranberry bitters and Gran Classico, a bitter aperitif made from aromatic herbs and roots, including wormwood, gentian, orange peel and rhubarb. “This combination is perfect because the homemade pumpkin butter adds depth and richness to the bourbon, along with a touch of fall spice,” says Gross. “This whole combination is completed by smoking the cocktail with thyme, which is another essential fall flavor.” Go ahead and play with fire, and try making the Butter & Smoke for yourself. Creating the pumpkin-butter-infused bourbon is an extra step that must be completed ahead of time, but the result is worth it. You’ll be the proud new owner of a delicious whiskey, and you’ll have plenty of leftovers for experimenting with other seasonal drinks during fall and winter. 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'sprig', 'ingredient': 'thyme'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pumpkin-butter-infused fat-washed bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Tempus Fugit Gran Classico bitter aperitif'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'thyme sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cranberries', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Light a thyme sprig using a kitchen torch, place it inside a rocks glass, and set the rocks glass upside down on a granite countertop or other fireproof surface.', 'Add the remaining ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass over a large ice cube, and swirl to incorporate the smoke into the liquid.', 'Garnish with a thyme sprig and cranberries.']",14,bourbon

Pairing its complex flavors and 110-proof strength with other ingredients in cocktails is no easy task, but green Chartreuse is a bartender favorite that’s required in acclaimed classics like the Last Word. “Chartreuse, in my opinion, is the king of liqueurs,” says Adam Gamboa, the lead bartender at Il Posto in Denver. “It’s powerful, unique, smooth and versatile and leaves me questioning what hidden flavors and aromatics I have yet to discover.” He likes using it in gin-based cocktails, noting it complements a variety of ingredients, including lime, pineapple, absinthe and various herbs. But one unexpected friend of Chartreuse is whiskey, which has enough character to hold its own with the forceful liqueur. “Creating a beautifully balanced cocktail with Chartreuse can be challenging, as few spirits stand up to its bold profile,” he says, proving his point with his Chartreuse Manhattan.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/uncle-angelos-eggnog/,Uncle Angelo’s Eggnog,Liquor.com,"Eggnog is a holiday staple that has been gracing glasses for centuries. Its key components are eggs, cream, sugar, spice and a spirit, but within that definition lies a lot of room for experimentation. Eggnog can be consumed hot or cold. Some people make it with bourbon or rum, while others choose cognac or sherry or a combination of spirits. Many recipes suggest shaking the ingredients with ice, while others treat the drink more like a baked good, enlisting bowls, whisks and spatulas to whip and combine eggs. There’s not one right way to make Eggnog, but if you’re going to follow someone’s lead, you might as well follow King Cocktail himself, Dale DeGroff . He created this Uncle Angelo’s Eggnog recipe, which features a split base of bourbon and spiced rum. The ingredients are simple—spirits, eggs, sugar, milk and cream—but the procedure requires a few steps. Egg whites and yolks are separated and mixed with the other ingredients, then eventually combined, yielding a fluffy and rich version of the drink. Make a batch during the holidays to treat yourself and your guests to a sweet and creamy treat. This recipe yields 12 servings, so once the punch bowl is filled, set out cups and a ladle, and then sit back and relax. Your job is done.

Finally, says Jason Sorbet, beverage director of The Chloe in New Orleans, freshly-squeezed lime juice gives the Mamie Taylor a bright lift, tying the drink together in a centuries-old classic flavor combination. “Mule-style cocktails are loosely based on the Buck cocktail family, which by extension is related to the Collins —these originated in the late 1800s, as ginger beer was commonly used as a digestive aid,” Sorbet shares. Depending on the ginger beer and whisky you use in your drink, he adds, you can create dramatically different flavor profiles with little risk of missing the mark. “Ginger beer pairs well with most spirits, but I’d say it works best with whiskey—specifically blended scotch—[thanks to] vanilla, maple, and burnt sugar characteristics.” Here‘s how to make the Mamie Taylor at home.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-buck/,Gin Buck,Liquor.com,"The buck is a style of cocktail that is defined as containing a spirit, citrus and either ginger ale or ginger beer. It’s believed that the name stems from the Horse’s Neck, which was traditionally a glass of nonalcoholic ginger ale. Adding liquor to the drink became known as a “buck” because it contained a kick. Bucks are refreshing and endlessly customizable, hence their popularity behind bars and with drinkers. The first bucks date to the mid-1800s and were typically spiked with whiskey, but any spirit works. If you’ve ever had a Moscow Mule (vodka) or a Dark ’n Stormy (rum), you’ve had a buck, while other examples may contain brandy, tequila and even aquavit. The Gin Buck, of course, calls for gin. The simple, sweet and bubbly drink was a popular summer cooler during the Roaring ’20s and into the ’40s. Today, the Gin Buck is overshadowed by whiskey-based bucks and Moscow Mules, but it deserves a place on your to-drink list, especially when the weather’s warm and you want a quaffable option for drinking outdoors. Despite its simplicity, the Gin Buck still offers opportunities to be tailored to your tastes. Start with the gin. A drier bottle that predominately showcases juniper will provide a different experience than one that is softer with more citrus. Then there’s the ginger. Ginger beer is spicier and bolder than ginger ale and more akin to what people were drinking a century ago. Both options make tasty cocktails, so try both to see which you prefer. Finally, you need fruit. Lemon and lime juice work great, so again it comes down to personal preference. Match your garnish to your juice, and you’re done. Fortunately, the delicious Gin Buck in your hand is easy to replicate, should you require a refill or receive jealous glances from thirsty friends.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/blood-and-sand/,Blood & Sand,Gary Regan,"The Blood & Sand is a classic scotch-based cocktail. The recipe first appeared in 1930 in The Savoy Cocktail Book by Harry Craddock. But did Craddock invent it, or only put it in his book? No one knows. So if we don’t know its inventor and we’ve no idea about the establishment in which it originally reared its spicy little head (unless it was the Savoy), what do we know about the drink? Nothing, save the fact that, in all probability, it was named for a 1922 movie starring Rudolph Valentino, the silent-film star known as “The Latin Lover.” Valentino’s performance in Blood and Sand —it centered on a bullfighter and was based on the novel by Vincente Blasco Ibáñez—was said to have been one of his finest, though the picture itself wasn’t exactly hailed as a masterpiece. “It is the story’s name and not the story or plot that made ‘Blood and Sand’ the big hit,” wrote a reviewer at the time. Such is not the case with the cocktail. The drink was introduced to me by Dale DeGroff when he held forth from behind the bar at New York’s Rainbow Room, circa 1997. When DeGroff told me about it, he said that the list of ingredients pretty much confounded him, so he had to try one. I concurred. Scotch, cherry brandy, sweet vermouth and orange juice don’t seem to belong in the same crib, let alone the same glass. The fact is that this Blood and Sand works very well, indeed.

In each market, the fun events brought together local personalities, scotch eggs and good drinks, like My Golden Dram. It’s rare that you see scotch and Champagne together in a glass, but that’s exactly what’s happening here. My Golden Dram walks the middle ground between a classic Champagne Cocktail, which features champagne, sugar and bitters, and a Seelbach , which calls for bourbon, Cointreau, Champagne and both Angostura and Peychaud’s bitters. This cocktail really shows what scotch can do in drinks, even when used modestly, and proves that not all scotch cocktails must be dark and moody. Aberfeldy 12-year has notes of honeyed fruit, vanilla, fudge and spices, with a whisper of smoke on the finish. Pair that with an aromatic bitters-soaked sugar cube and effervescent Champagne, and you have a refreshing scotch cocktail that’s packed with flavor and fit for a celebration. 8 Sparkling Wine Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sugar cube'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aberfeldy 12-year-old scotch'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Prosecco'}]","['Place a napkin over the top of a Champagne flute, and put a sugar cube on the napkin.', 'Soak the sugar cube with 3 dashes of Angostura bitters, then flip the napkin so the cube falls into the flute.', 'Add the scotch, stir lightly, and top with the prosecco .']",10,scotch
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whisky-mac/,Whisky Mac,Liquor.com,"This old-school whiskey cocktail is shorthand for the Whisky Macdonald, so named for Colonel Hector “Fighting Mac” MacDonald. McDonald first crafted the drink circa 1900, while serving during the British Raj in India. It’s a simple combination of blended scotch and Stone’s Original green ginger wine, a fortified wine described on the bottle as a “ginger flavored currant wine,” one that clocks in at 13.9% ABV. Ginger was popular around the turn of the 20th century as a remedy for a host of ailments, from digestive issues to cholera. Naturally, British soldiers stationed in India gravitated toward ginger wine, similar to how sailors drank the vitamin-packed Gimlet to ward off scurvy. Eventually, those soldiers began mixing ginger wine with scotch whisky, and the Whisky Mac was born. The Whisky Mac is a relatively obscure cocktail, and one you likely won’t find on many bar menus. But it remains popular among in-the-know drinkers who appreciate its unique flavor and potency. Fortunately, the drink is easy to make, especially because you can source the ginger wine online. Once you have your two ingredients in hand, you build the Whisky Mac right in your glass with ice—no shaking, stirring or bar tools required. Today, it’s traditionally served over ice, but the Whisky Mac can also be served at room temperature or even mixed with hot water. Its invigorating effects work wonders on chilly ski slopes, fishing trips and other places where flasked cocktails might appear. This recipe uses a 3:2 ratio of scotch to ginger wine, but those desiring more pronounced ginger flavor can combine their drink using a 1:1 ratio. Does the Whisky Mac Cocktail Deserve a Comeback?

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rusty-compass/,Rusty Compass,Liquor.com,"While bourbon and rye rule the whiskey cocktail world, with drinks from the Sazerac to the Manhattan , their brethren across the ocean in that gray and misty northern tip of the United Kingdom see less use in mixed drinks. Generally, scotch is consumed on its own, or maybe with a bit of water to help open up its flavors. But The Peat Monster from Compass Box Whisky needs no such aid in unlocking its bold and smoky self. It forms the base of the Rusty Compass from bartending veteran Meaghan Dorman, and while the drink won’t do much to help you get home if you’re lost at sea, it does, at least, taste delicious. In such a bold and potent concoction, the Peat Monster is assertive enough to not get lost in the rich flavors of Drambuie . It is a bit like doubling down, though, as Drambuie is a scotch-based liqueur flavored with honey, herbs and spices. There’s a clear precedent, though: the Rusty Nail , a 2-to-1 mix of scotch and Drambuie that gives the Rusty Compass the inspiration for the other part of its name. The Rusty Compass also gets some added bittersweetness from Cherry Heering Liqueur . This liqueur comes by way of Denmark and is a neutral grain spirit flavored with cherries and spices. Like scotch and Drambuie, scotch and Heering have a cocktail precedent, as well: the Blood & Sand , arguably the most famous of scotch drinks, also features a mix of Heering and scotch. If Heering isn’t readily available, it’s acceptable to substitute for another fine cherry liqueur like Luxardo maraschino. If using, say, a kirsch, which is unsweetened, a dash or two of simple syrup might be required. However, using one of those substitutions will impact the drink’s signature ruby hue. This crimson concoction is no slouch.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/emerald/,Emerald,Liquor.com,"When it comes to celebrating Irish holidays like St. Patrick’s Day, there are generally only a handful of widely known options. There’s the Irish Shot , whose regrettable previous moniker of Irish Car Bomb has thankfully been slowly abandoned. There’s the beloved Irish Coffee , a quintessential cold-weather drink. And there’s the Tipperary , a lush and rich cocktail with Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, green Chartreuse and bitters. It’s a bit of a short list, so fans of the oft-misunderstood but beloved family of Irish whiskeys are often looking for something new. For an easy, familiar take on a classic, why not turn to one of the mothers of all whiskey drinks, the singular Manhattan? After all, the Tipperary is essentially the same drink, only with the addition of half an ounce of green Chartreuse . The beauty of the Irish Manhattan is that it takes very little thought. Merely substitute your favorite Irish whiskey for the traditional rye or bourbon in the drink, and call it good. But the other benefit of the Manhattan, Irish or otherwise, is the flexibility of it.

Over the decades, it has enjoyed a rollercoaster rise and fall, going from a revered refreshment to a bastardized version of its former self, characterized by blenders and artificially flavored mixed. These days, it’s back on top, once more a respected member of the current cocktail canon. And yet, bartenders still manage to tweak the traditional recipe in new and unusual ways. Variations like the Hemingway Daiquiri and freshly made Strawberry Daiquiri will always have their place on the bar. But occasionally the bounds of the cocktail’s limits are tested, like you find with this Magic Cotton Candy Daiquiri. This fun, irreverent take on the classic swaps out sugar (usually simple syrup ) for cotton candy, that fluffy, sugary childhood treat. When the cold liquid is poured over the cotton candy in the glass, a bit of magic happens, and the cotton candy melts, disappearing before your very eyes. The sugar incorporates into the rum and the tart lime, helping to balance the cocktail, and the liquid’s color changes depending on the type of cotton candy you choose.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/marzipan-old-fashioned/,Marzipan Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"The Old Fashioned is as traditional a cocktail as you can get, with a straightforward mix of spirit, sugar and bitters. That simplicity allows for a lot of play, leading to countless variations on the tried-and-true recipe. One such variation comes from Cody Pruitt, the beverage director at New York City’s Anfora , a wine and cocktail bar in the West Village. However, rather than the more expected base ingredients like bourbon or even rum , Pruitt uses something a little more unconventional: two types of agave spirits, with mezcal and reposado tequila acting as a mixed base. Pruitt uses a blend of Los Amantes joven mezcal and Espolón reposado tequila for the Marzipan Old Fashioned. The “joven” in the mezcal refers to it, like many mezcals on the market, being un-aged, leaving it clear and bright. If substituting another mezcal you may have on hand, be sure to use another clear version. Similarly, the tequila is a reposado from Espolón, which means it’s been aged for less than a year, leaving it with a pale gold color. While Espolón is a fairly popular brand for bartenders because of its price point and quality, it too can be switched out as long as its replacement is both of decent quality and a reposado. Equally significant to the craft of the Marzipan Old Fashioned is the ingredient that gives the cocktail its name. Rather than using the traditional simple syrup (a mix of sugar and water), Pruitt melts De La Rosa peanut marzipan candies into a marzipan syrup for the drink. Like the two spirits, this sweet treat comes from Mexico and has a strong history of more than 70 years of candy production. Luckily, these classic Mexican peanut candies are available regularly throughout the United States, as well as for purchase online. To make the sweetener, Pruitt simmers the candies with water until the peanuts separate from the candy and the marzipan incorporates with the water, turning into a syrup. The resulting syrup will still have some nuttiness from the candies, and a touch of oloroso sherry further enhances while also giving the drink some increased complexity, salinity and richness. In particular, Pruitt uses Lustau, a popular sherry brand among bartenders for its high quality and relatively low cost.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Los Amantes joven mezcal'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Espolón reposado tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lustau oloroso sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'marzipan syrup'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir.', 'Strain into a double rocks glass over a large ice cube.']",0,mezcal

Created by bartender Brandi Austin at STIRR in Dallas, the drink is essentially a boozy recreation of melted mint chocolate ice cream—or a mint chocolate milkshake. It calls for Irish cream liqueur, creme de menthe liqueur and Frangelico, a hazelnut-based liqueur with overtones of cocoa and vanilla. Somewhat ironically, Bailey’s Irish Cream , the brand specified for the Mint Chocolate Chip Shot, doesn’t have much in the way of chocolate; the famous liqueur just has a touch of cocoa extract. If you’re up for it, making your own Irish cream is a fun approach. Frangelico adds a nuttiness and a bit more cocoa, but Austin omits it sometimes, substituting vodka instead to make the drink “a touch more potent.” Whether you use vodka or Frangelico, the drink receives an extra bit of chocolate in the form of chocolate sauce (or syrup) drizzled in the shot glass. Irish Cream Liqueur RELATED ARTICLE Austin doesn’t specify the kind of creme de menthe used, but it comes down to a matter of color preference. Using green creme de menthe will give the shot that familiar verdant hue of many mint chocolate ice cream brands, while using a white one will make it more of a black-and-white drink. Since this creation is served as a shot rather than a full cocktail, it’s generally made in a large volume, then doled out as one-ounce pours when entertaining. Given the relatively lower alcohol percentage in each liqueur, it’s best to avoid freezing them—unless you want a slushy with ice crystals in it. Storing the batch in the fridge until serving time is the preferred approach. Additionally, chilling the shot glasses before filling them keeps the drink nice and cool, ready to be topped with whipped cream and downed as a sweet, rich dessert shot.","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Baileys Irish Cream'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'creme de menthe'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Frangelico'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Chocolate sauce'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'whipped cream', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine the Baileys Irish Cream, creme de menthe and Frangelico in a pitcher, and place in the refrigerator to chill.', 'Drizzle chocolate sauce in each of 8 shot glasses.', 'Add 1 1/2 ounces of the pre-batched drink to each glass.', 'Garnish with mint leaves and whipped cream.']",10,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/devils-margarita/,Devil’s Margarita,Liquor.com,"A well-made Margarita is pure joy. That synergistic combination of earthy tequila, tart lime and sweetener (usually orange liqueur or agave nectar) hits all the right notes. But when you crave a more impish cocktail, the Devil’s Margarita is here for you. And you don’t have to wait until Halloween to drink it. This tasty twist on the classic updates the traditional formula with a float of red wine—ideally a fruity medium-bodied wine such as cabernet franc—which adds a dash of depth and color. The Devil’s Margarita isn’t the only cocktail to request a red wine float. The New York Sour, which is a Whiskey Sour topped with red wine, dates to the late 1800s and is another pleasant means of mixing spirits with wine. So, this Margarita is in good company. The recipe calls for agave-forward blanco tequila. The unaged expression lends notes of citrus and pepper, absent any of the oaky vanilla and caramel flavors found in aged varieties. Fresh lime juice is key to any good Margarita, so be sure that’s on your grocery list. And rather than orange liqueur or agave nectar, you will sweeten this drink with simple syrup to allow the other ingredients to shine. Pro tip: Skip the salted rim. It’s a nice addition to most Margaritas, but in this case it clashes with the wine’s acidity. Plus, it looks too much like a halo for this devilish drink.

Instead, it’s a cocktail from New York drinks pro Mayur Subbarao that riffs on the classic Corpse Reviver No. 2 . The original drink combines equal parts gin, lemon juice, orange liqueur and Lillet blanc with a dash of absinthe, while the Necromancer leans more heavily on the absinthe, dials back the gin and swaps elderflower liqueur for orange liqueur. The resulting cocktail is herbal, floral and aromatic, with a full three-quarters of an ounce of absinthe. The elderflower liqueur brings floral sweetness, while the Lillet blanc, a French wine-based aperitif, lends body alongside notes of citrus and honey. Fresh lemon juice provides balance and keeps the strong flavors in check. Corpse Revivers are a family of drinks dating back to at least the 1870s that were meant to wake one from the dead. In other words, they were consumed to combat hangovers and put some pep in your step at the start of a new day. The Necromancer falls in line. It’s herbal, tart and refreshing, so if coffee isn’t getting the job done, try starting your morning with one of these.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/red-beans-rice-orgeat/,Red Beans & Rice Orgeat,Tara Rizzi,"When I first began bartending at Seaworthy , the oyster bar at Ace Hotel in New Orleans, I was asked to make sure it retained its Tiki vibe. As someone with a severe nut allergy, I was immediately alarmed. Orgeat , the staple sweetener used in Tiki drinks , is made with almonds. I did some research and learned that orgeat was originally made with barley as an alternative to dairy that would not spoil. I also learned that the popular rice drink horchata is derived from the Catalan word for barley, orxata. My initial thought was to make an horchata orgeat, but it lacked depth, playfulness and a true New Orleans feel. Then the idea of a red beans and rice orgeat came to me. The red beans give it the feel of adzuki (the sweet red bean mash popular in Chinese pastries), and I chose orange blossom water instead of rose water as the citrus complements the vanilla beans better and makes the orgeat a little more versatile for classic Tiki drinks. The cocktail on Seaworthy’s current menu that contains this nut-free version of orgeat is called the Curiouser & Curiouser, a nod to “Alice in Wonderland.” This drink is made with sweet-pea-flower-infused gin, cucumber juice, lemon and the red beans and rice orgeat. It was our bestseller the summer of 2019 and, best of all, I can enjoy one myself.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'red beans'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'white rice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'orange blossom water'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'vanilla beans'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}]","['In a large rondeau pot, toast beans and rice until lightly browned.', 'Add vodka, orange blossom water, vanilla beans and 8 cups water and bring to a boil.', 'Remove from heat, strain liquid and reserve liquid.', 'Put resulting mash back in pot, add 8 cups sugar and 8 cups water.', 'Bring to a boil, remove from heat, strain and reserve liquid.', 'Combine mash and both reserved liquids.', 'Keeps in refrigerator for up to one month.']",10,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-saturn/,Saturn,Liquor.com,"Normally, when considering the wide world of Tiki drinks, you’ll think of rum, as the spirit dominates the scene with its Mai Tais and Zombies . Surprisingly, the second most common spirit seen in these faux-tropical drinks is probably gin, and the most famous of these gin-based Tiki cocktails is the Saturn. Though it uses the juniper-based spirit, it also includes many of the hallmarks of Tiki bartending: fresh juices, multiple syrups and a complicated, interesting history. It “carries the regality of a Mai Tai with the drinkability of a Tom Collins ,” according to Garret Richard of New York City’s Slowly Shirley and The Happiest Hour . California bartender  J. “Popo” Galsini introduced the Saturn to the world in 1967 when he won the International Bartender’s Association World Championship with it. Originally he titled his gin creation the X-15 after an American rocket plane, but shortly after doing so one of those planes crashed, killing its pilot. Reportedly, Galsini changed the name of the drink to the Saturn for the competition, in honor of the Saturn rocket that propelled the first Apollo rocket flight into space, months after the fateful X-15 crash. Galsini’s storied history involved decades at multiple bars in California, mainly tropical-themed ones during the style’s mid-century heyday. However, his invention would have likely remained lost to the annals of time were it not for serendipity: historian and Tiki specialist Jeff “Beachbum” Berry happened upon a commemorative glass at a thrift shop in Southern California. He didn’t buy it, but he did copy the outline of the recipe down, and would later publish it in his 2010 recipe book “Beachbum Berry Remixed.” As for the drink itself, it’s understandable why it’s become a mainstay on Tiki menus. Despite starting with gin, the drink is very much in the category thanks to the inclusion of sweet-tart passion fruit syrup and the rich, nutty flavors of falernum and orgeat . But even with three different syrups it’s not too sweet, thanks to the bitterness of gin instead of the inherent sweetness of rum. Also like many drinks under the paper umbrella of Tiki, the Saturn is served as an icy blended drink, making it extra refreshing and enlivening. With its edible flower garnish, it’s a striking drink to behold.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'passion fruit syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'falernum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orgeat'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible flower', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, lemon juice, passion fruit syrup, falernum and orgeat to a blender with crushed ice, and blend until smooth.', 'Pour unstrained into a Tiki mug or highball glass.', 'Garnish with an edible flower and an orange twist.']",38,gin

It features cognac, rye whiskey, two amari, and orgeat. Orgeat is a nut-based syrup that lends silky sweetness to iconic tropical cocktails like the Mai Tai , Scorpion, and Fog Cutter. It was originally made with barley, but once it was discovered that almonds produce more flavor, barley was dropped from the recipe. Today, almond orgeat still reigns, but bartenders are experimenting with other nuts, including walnuts, hazelnuts, and pistachios. The exact proportions of orgeat vary by the maker, but the syrup generally consists of a combination of ground blanched nuts, sugar, and a floral component, like orange blossom water or rose water. In the Tender Nob, orgeat adds sweetness and body, while complementing the spirits and Italian liqueurs. Diedrich uses a housemade walnut orgeat, but for simplicity’s sake we’ve updated the recipe to feature an almond-based orgeat. Rye and cognac are a popular duo, employed in other classics like the Vieux Carré . Strega is an herbal liqueur based on a 150-year-old recipe that is said to include up to 70 different botanicals—one being saffron, which gives it its signature bright yellow color.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mai-tai/,Latitude 29 Mai Tai,Liquor.com,"The Mai Tai is the quintessential torch bearer of Tiki, and the movement’s flagship drink. It made its flowery foray into American culture between the 1930s and 1950s, thanks to tropical-minded entrepreneurs like Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt (a.k.a. Donn Beach) and Victor Jules Bergeron (a.k.a. Trader Vic). Then, it suffered some ill use in the 1980s and 1990s, which saw its once pristine amalgamation of rums, orange liqueur, lime juice, orgeat and simple syrup befouled by the inclusion of fruit juices and artificial sweeteners. Luckily, the later part of the 2000s saw a Tiki revival that restored the cocktail to its once noble heights. This classic recipe comes from Tiki historian Jeff “Beachbum” Berry, the owner of New Orleans’ ode to Tikidom, Latitude 29. The recipe isn’t so much a variation on the drink as it is a faithful recreation of an original recipe—but what is specified are the rums used in Berry’s version. While both popular brands, it is possible to be in a market where you can’t find the Coruba dark Jamaican rum or the Rhum Clément V.S.O.P. In this case, the best move is to find a close approximation of each, like another dark Jamaican rum to fill in for the Coruba. Rhum agricole, the Rhum Clément in Berry’s recipe, is a type of rum that is made with sugar cane rather than molasses. This gives the spirit bright, floral and sometimes grassy or vegetal notes. The vieux in the name refers to the rum being aged for at least three years. So if you are going for a different rhum agricole, make sure it’s an aged one to best replicate the Latitude 29 Mai Tai. Another aspect of this particular version of the timeless drink is the use of the Latitude 29 Formula orgeat made by Orgeat Works, a company specializing in bar syrups for Tiki cocktails. Founder Adam Kolesar worked with Berry to craft an orgeat that was specifically designed for Latitude’s Mai Tais, and is a close approximation of the syrup Trader Vic would have been using in 1944.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/nutty-ocho-rios/,Nutty Ocho Rios,Liquor.com,"This cocktail from Austin bartender Shane Paule is a nutty take on the classic Mai Tai —not because it’s strange, but because it has macadamia nut liqueur in it. Like many tropically inspired drinks, the Nutty Ocho Rios features a split-base of two types of rum. White rum provides structure and backbone, while Jamaican rum adds an element of rich, flavorful funk. Next up is orgeat, a sweet syrup that plays an important role in many Tiki classics. It’s typically made with almonds, but it can also be produced with other nuts, including cashews, pecans and pistachios. Paule stays traditional here, going the almond route. So far, he’s sticking pretty close to the traditional Mai Tai recipe, but here’s where Paule’s drink diverges from the path: It skips the orange curaçao and instead opts for more nutty flavor (an apt choice given the cocktail’s name) by using a half ounce of Trader Vic’s macadamia nut liqueur. This fun ingredient is made with Hawaiian macadamia nuts and sports flavors of toasted nuts and sweet vanilla to go with its creamy mouthfeel. Together with the orgeat, it intensifies the earthy flavors of the drink, complementing the tried-and-true combination of rum and lime. It also lends additional octane at 26.5% ABV.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/my-thai/,My Thai,Liquor.com,"The Mai Tai is one of the all-time cocktail greats. Historically the flagship drink of Tiki bartending and an overall excellent use for rum, the drink spent a few years being abused with sugary syrups and fruit juices. These days, most bars bothering to put one on their menu hew much closer to the original blend of rums, lime juice, orgeat and orange liqueur, and the Mai Tai has been generally restored to its proper place in the cocktail oeuvre. And its versatility remains one of its most charming aspects, with bartenders riffing on the drink in numerous ways. One such variation is the My Thai from bartending icon and author Jim Meehan, the co-founder of the legendary speakeasy Please Don’t Tell in New York City and Hong Kong, and founder of Portland, Oregon’s izakaya Takibi. While Mai Tai recipes are often flexible on the rum used, the My Thai is particular when it calls for Banks 5-Island Blend rum , a blend of more than 20 different rums from Trinidad, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados and Java in Indonesia. “The addition of Indonesian arrack to a blend of West Indies rums is what made Banks 5 unique when it launched back in 2010,” says Meehan. “This recipe—created around that time—reimagined Trader Vic looking to Thailand instead of Tahiti as part of the inspiration behind his most famous cocktail.” To enhance the Thai elements of the drink, the My Thai gets added heat from a Thai chile pepper muddled with Grand Marnier. And rather than orgeat , the almond and rose water syrup normally used in Mai Tais, it employs coconut milk, which helps to mellow some of the pepper’s burn. Because coconut milk is far less sweet than orgeat—and because Meehan doesn’t use simple syrup in the recipe—this frees the drink up for some additional sugar in the form of fresh pineapple juice. The result is a Mai Tai with Thai flavors, perfect for dinner parties and patio drinking.

The bar is known for stocking one of the country’s most impressive rum selections, but this drink skips rum entirely, instead calling on gin as its base spirit. Gin isn’t a common ingredient in Tiki and tropical drinks, but it does make an appearance on occasion—most notably in cocktails like the Singapore Sling and the Suffering Bastard . Gin’s botanicals play nicely with a variety of citrus and other fruit juices, as well as orgeat and liqueurs, which all feature heavily in Tiki drinks.

Club soda rounds the flavors out and provides effervescence with each sip. Smuggler’s Cove Straits Sling shares several ingredients with the Singapore Sling, which also includes Herring cherry liqueur and Benedictine in addition to gin. Those similarities diverge in the juice and sweetener departments, though. The Singapore version calls for pineapple and lime juices, plus Grand Marnier, a richly flavored orange liqueur. The Smuggler’s Cove cocktail sticks to lemon juice and uses demarara syrup for sweetener, yielding a drink that’s a little sweet, a little tart and a lot delicious.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pearl-diver/,Pearl Diver,Liquor.com,"Tiki drinks include a bevy of ingredients that are rarely found outside the Tiki-tropical canon , including orgeat, falernum and gardenia mix. Jeff “Beachbum” Berry is credited with reviving the latter, as well as a historically accurate version of the mix‘s raison d’etre, the Pearl Diver cocktail, back in 2006. At his bar Latitude 29 in New Orleans, he continues to showcase gardenia mix in the Pontchartrain Pearl Diver, which also includes Jamaican rum, passion fruit and lime. But this is the classic Pearl Diver, combining two types of rum—an aged column-still rum and rich demerara rum—along with gardenia mix, fresh lime and orange juices, and aromatic bitters. Gardenia mix, or more accurately Don’s Gardenia Mix, combines honey, butter, cinnamon syrup, allspice and vanilla, whipped together with a spatula or electric mixer. It’s one of the many flavor-bomb concoctions imagined by the Tiki legend Donn Beach, proprietor of famed bar Don the Beachcomber and inventor of many now-classic cocktails. “Gardenia mix is a spiced honey-butter cordial,” says Anthony Schmidt, the beverage director of San Diego’s Consortium Holdings projects, which includes Tiki bar False Idol . In the Pearl Diver, it adds rich spice and vanilla notes to the cocktail, but he says that gardenia mix doesn’t need to be confined to this drink or Tiki drinks in general. “It adds a desirable richness to beverages while limiting the impact of sweetness. In other words, you can develop texture and richness while maintaining a not-too-sweet beverage balance.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/holy-water/,Holy Water,Virginia Miller,"The Holy Water is the flagship cocktail at Seaworthy, in the Ace Hotel in New Orleans. Created by beverage consultant Lauren Schell, the drink is served in a custom tarot glass from local shop Flambeauxs. It sees Hamilton Jamaican gold rum steeped with golden raisins, orange peels, vanilla bean, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and other spices, then shaken with Maison rouge cognac, lemon, lime and grapefruit juices, with a float of Angostura bitters on top. A half-lime garnish filled with green Chartreuse and a sugar cube is then lit tableside, caramelizing the sugar and releasing aromas of citrus, herbs and spice. Paying a little extra means that guests get to leave with the glass in hand. “The fire caramelizes the sugar, giving the drink depth and added richness,” says Schell. “It’s a crucial element of balance, in addition to being eye-catching and purposefully interactive.” “The Holy Water is interesting because you have a blend of citrus, almond, french oak, spiced rum, and herbs from the flamed Chartreuse,” says Seaworthy’s beverage director, Matt Ray. “It’s a classic tiki drink in the sense that as the layers interact and the ice melts, the cocktail actively changes. It rewards you for taking your time.” Infusing the rum with all the required botanicals makes a lot of sense for the crew at Seaworthy, who sell multiple glasses of it a night. For home bartenders, though, it can be a bit overkill.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/momisette/,Momisette,Liquor.com,"Wander through nearly any city in France, and you’ll see crowds gathering at cafes during the afternoon hours for cocktails and conversation. It’s the kind of ritual you’ll want to join. And if you find yourself in the southeastern part of the country, particularly in or around Marseille, those drinks are likely to contain pastis. Pastis is an anise-flavored liqueur made by macerating aniseed or star anise with licorice root and herbs. This mixture is combined with a neutral base spirit and typically bottled at 40% to 45% ABV. In France, the two big names in pastis are Pernod and Ricard, which are today owned by the merged mega-conglomerate Pernod Ricard. The common way to drink pastis is by mixing it with cold water, which results in a cloudy mixture that is given the nickname Milk of Marseille. The Momisette cocktail takes things one step further by adding orgeat, the sweet and creamy syrup that is essential in Tiki classics like the Mai Tai , and by using sparkling water instead of still water. Momisette is French for “tiny mummy,” which is difficult to explain but a fun fact you can share while mixing up a round for your friends. The simple combination of pastis, orgeat and bubbly water yields a refreshing drink with a silky smooth flavor and texture. Most orgeats are made by combining almonds with sugar, water and a fortifying spirit like brandy, plus a dash of orange flower water. However, modern recipes sometimes call for different nuts, including pistachios and hazelnuts. Commercial orgeat will most likely feature almonds, but if you’re making it at home, you can use your preferred nut, knowing that almond-based orgeat will make the most traditional Momisette cocktail. Pastis hit the market in 1932 during the period when absinthe was banned, and while the two drinks are made differently and feature some different ingredients, they are similar in taste. Pastis is a solid substitute in cocktails like the Sazerac , which calls for a small measure of absinthe. So, if you buy a bottle of pastis, you can find several uses for it beyond the Momisette.

Most commonly you’ll see ingredients like cinnamon, vanilla, mint, clove and ginger. But herbs more traditionally used in savory cooking are less common, which makes the turmeric-infused Lazy Sunday so rare. Native to India and areas of Southeast Asia, the golden-hued turmeric is a popular inclusion in many cultures’ cooking for its reported health benefits and its subtle, ginger-like flavor. More often than not it is found dried and powdered, as it is in the recipe for the Lazy Sunday. The Lazy Sunday comes from Anna Maceda, the co-owner and bar manager of Italian restaurant and bar Campana in Portland, Oregon. In the cocktail, she combines tequila with grapefruit juice, cinnamon syrup and a house-made turmeric tea, then tops it with club soda. Tequila and grapefruit are a time-honored combination, with drinks like the Paloma , while the cinnamon syrup adds gentle heat and sweetness. Topping the cocktail with soda water would make a perfectly delectable highball, but Maceda goes further, dialing up the complexity with her turmeric tea. “Turmeric really balances the sweetness of the other ingredients, and its spice complements the Ceylon cinnamon beautifully,” she says. “Turmeric also has a ton of health benefits thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, and I think a cocktail can be somewhat healthy, too.” As for the name, Maceda says it came naturally. “It was my dream to sit around all day on Sunday and drink these,” she says. “I'm not kidding: It was my fantasy drink.”","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'turmeric tea'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda water, to top'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: grapefruit twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the soda water.', 'Garnish with a grapefruit twist.']",4,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/appletini/,Appletini,Nonna Titulauri,"It’s probably been awhile since you’ve seen an Appletini on the menu at your favorite bar, but there was a time when the neon-colored phenom dominated cocktail culture. Both sweet and sour with a subtle kick and the complexion of liquid kryptonite, the Apple Martini was a smash hit from the moment it burst onto the scene more than two decades ago. It all started one Fourth of July at a West Hollywood restaurant called Lola’s, when owner Loren “Lola” Dunsworth was approached by a representative from then-fledgling vodka brand Ketel One with the idea of making a signature Martini . Dunsworth noticed a lonely bottle of apple schnapps on the back bar and asked bartender Adam Karston to see if he could whip something up using the two. He combined equal parts DeKuyper Pucker sour apple schnapps imitation liqueur and Ketel One vodka and added a splash of house-made sweet-and-sour mix, and, just like that, a legend was born. The cocktail was so successful that it had to be taken off the menu. “They were easy to drink because you didn’t really taste the alcohol,” says Dunsworth. “People were abusing them. I thought, Let’s take it off for a while. But there was such an uproar that we quickly ended up putting it back.” Within six months, word of the cocktail spread across the country, and soon every bar and restaurant worth its Martini menu was flaunting its own version of the green concoction. But none of them stood up to the original Appletini. One difference, says Dunsworth, is that Lola’s garnished its drink with Granny Smith apple slices, which the bar marinated in lemon water and ice to keep fresh. “People would say to me, ‘Oh, my God, it just tastes so much better here.’” The Appletini marched proudly into the late-1990s and early aughts as a symbol of innocence and pre-9/11 America. Part punchline and part guilty pleasure, it was always the happy person’s drink more than the cool kid’s go-to. It’s what Zach Braff’s character ordered on “Scrubs” and the toast of choice during the Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker meeting in “The Social Network .” The Appletini was, by all definitions, a globally recognized modern classic. “Don’t get me wrong, the craft cocktail movement is great,” says Dunsworth. “But many of the drinks are kind of fly-by-night. Very few of them stick because they’re too complicated and have too many ingredients. The true classics, like the Manhattan , are simple and easy to make. They have staying power.” In 2013, after 17 years of happy hours and sticky bar tops, Lola’s closed its doors for the last time. But its signature cocktail lives on, albeit in a more contemporary form. Bartenders have been remaking the cocktail using everything from fresh Granny Smith apple juice to craft-quality apple liqueurs to chai-infused apple juice . We came up with our own updated version of the classic that substitutes Calvados and fresh Granny Smith apple juice for apple schnapps. A tiny bit of lemon juice and simple syrup highlights the green flavor profile that helped popularize the drink.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Calvados'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Granny Smith apple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Granny Smith apple slices', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add crushed ice into a cocktail glass and set aside to chill.', 'Add the vodka, Calvados, apple juice, lemon juice and simple syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Discard the ice from the cocktail glass and double-strain the mixture into the glass.', 'Garnish with a skewered brandied cherry and 3 Granny Smith apple slices.']",21,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/applejack-rabbit/,Applejack Rabbit,Liquor.com,"The Applejack Rabbit first appeared in Judge Jr.’s obscure 1927 tome, “ Here’s How ,” but it gained momentum in the mid-aughts thanks to Jim Meehan . At the time, the lauded bartender best known for his work at PDT in New York was behind the stick at Gramercy Tavern. Even though it’s an old American spirit, applejack wasn’t yet a mainstream product at contemporary bars or regularly requested by drinkers. Meehan constructed the drink with Laird’s bonded apple brandy, fresh lemon juice, fresh orange juice and maple syrup. He increased the lemon juice quotient slightly from the original recipe to give the luxurious notes of the brandy and maple syrup more backbone. The drink was popular, and even got some press, but its true test came when Lisa Laird Dunn of Laird & Company—the country’s oldest distiller dating back to 1698—stepped into the bar for a taste. Up to that point, Laird Dunn’s cocktail experience with her family’s applejack had been relegated mostly to sticky-sweet Jack Roses . But this cocktail—the warm apple notes made decadent with maple syrup, and the citrus juices adding levity and balance—was revelatory. “I’d never experienced anything like this,” says Laird Dunn. “I was floored.” Hey, if it’s good enough for a ninth-generation Laird, it’s probably good enough for anyone.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/angels-face/,Angel’s Face,Liquor.com,"Cocktails come in all shapes, sizes and styles, but most include one base spirit accented by liqueurs, fruit juices, fortified wines and other ingredients. Some, however, exert their strength with multiple base spirits, finding balance in two or more full-flavored liquors. That’s the case with the Angel’s Face, an original recipe from Brooklyn bartender Jay Zimmerman that combines gin and applejack , plus apricot liqueur. Gin is a classic base ingredient that holds up everything from the straight-spirits Martini to the citrusy Gimlet , but rarely does it join forces with applejack. Applejack is a type of apple brandy that dates back to the late 1600s. American colonists in the Northeast turned their apple harvests into hard cider, eventually realizing they had the beginnings of something stronger. They increased the cider’s alcohol content by leaving barrels outside overnight to freeze. Known as “jacking,” this method allowed these clever colonists to separate the alcohol that didn’t freeze from the ice remaining in the barrels, resulting in a high-proof spirit they dubbed “applejack.” Applejack is best known as an ingredient in the classic Jack Rose , but in the Angel’s Face it lends its trademark fruit notes to the botanical gin. Apricot liqueur brings additional fruit flavor and some sweetness to the cocktail. The ingredients are applied in equal parts, stirred with ice and garnished with an orange peel, so the drink is easy to create at home. You might not see an angel’s face with each sip, but it tastes heavenly just the same.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/nouveau-sangaree/,Nouveau Sangaree,Liquor.com,"Sangria might be Spanish in origin, but that doesn’t mean you can’t put an international spin on it. That’s exactly what famous New York City bartender and author Jim Meehan does with the Nouveau Sangaree, a Sangria twist with French and New England elements. While still bright and cheering, the drink has a lovely autumnal quality to it. And, rather than making a whole pitcher’s worth, this recipe is for single servings. As with any Sangria variation, this one starts with red wine. Specifically, Meehan uses Beaujolais Nouveau, a light red French wine made with gamay and released in November each year. Besides giving the drink part of its name, the wine gives it a bright, vivid base. You can use another wine, but if you do you’ll want to make sure to use something on the lighter-bodied side, like an American pinot noir. Classic Sangria 119 ratings Rather than a traditional brandy like cognac, Meehan opts for an American staple: Laird’s Bottled in Bond Apple Brandy, one of the oldest liquors in the country. Made from 100% apples, this rich and golden spirit evokes the autumn, and its apple flavors come through clearly even in cocktails. To add to that feeling of autumn in New England, Meehan sweetens the drink with a bit of maple syrup—grade B, which is darker and stronger than grade A. Sloe gin, a gin-based liquor flavored with English sloe berries, adds a touch of Old England. Meehan uses Plymouth sloe gin, but another sloe gin can be used instead—but keep in mind that traditional gin is not an accurate substitute. One way the Nouveau Sangaree differs from traditional sangria is with its presentation—rather than being served in a pitcher and poured over ice, it’s served in a cocktail glass with no ice, dusted with cinnamon and garnished with an apple slice. It’s like a full glass of Sangria condensed into a single cocktail-sized serving. 9 Red Wine Cocktails to Try Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Beaujolais nouveau wine'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Laird’s straight bottled in bond apple brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Plymouth sloe gin'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grade B maple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: apple slices', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: grated cinnamon', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Beaujolais nouveau (or other red wine), Laird’s apple brandy, sloe gin, maple syrup and Angostura bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with thin apple slices and grated cinnamon.']",10,brandy

Infusing the coconut into the whiskey is key in that it brings substantial body and richness to the drink, adding to this spirit-forward cocktail’s overall complexity.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/autumn/,Autumn,Liquor.com,"Bar veteran and drink writer Naren Young developed this cocktail and named it as straightforward as possible: the Autumn encapsulates the spirit of fall, mixing multiple ingredients each with their own autumnal aspects. The Autumn begins with apples: Laird’s Applejack, in particular. This historic spirit comes from the United States’s oldest active distillery. Applejack is very similar to apple brandy , only it’s a blend of apple distillate and neutral grain spirits, like vodka. The result is lighter and crisper while very apple-forward. To that, Young adds amontillado sherry, which gives the drink a strong backbone and rich nuttiness without adding much to the overall proof. The Autumn also gets a quarter-ounce of pear brandy to dial up the fall fruit aspect. Young opts for Clear Creek pear brandy, from the oldest operating distillery in Oregon. Clear Creek’s pear brandy is world-renowned, but you can can get away with using another— the pear brandy from from St. George Spirits in California, for instance, is also exceptional. Rather than simple syrup, Young leans into the fall vibes with maple syrup, then finishes the drink with more apple elements in the form of apple bitters. There are a few producers now making apple bitters, and they can also be used to add a subtle autumnal touch to your favorite Old Fashioned , Manhattan , or Hot Toddy recipe. Normally, the Autumn is stirred and served chilled over a large ice cube.

Consisting of gin, fresh lemon juice, sugar and Champagne, the drink is a lot friendlier than the name implies. Like many classic drinks, the French 75’s origin is mired in mystery and debate. According to drinks historian David Wondrich, the recipe first appeared in 1927 at the height of Prohibition in a book called “Here’s How” that was published by a New York humor magazine. The cocktail was soon immortalized in 1930 in the pages of Harry Craddock’s “The Savoy Cocktail Book,” which solidified the French 75’s spread in bars and homes around the world. How it was invented, however, is less clear. It’s likely that the drink cannot be attributed to one person, and instead, was the simple product of experimentation. Discerning drinkers in the 19th and early 20th centuries were known to combine gin and Champagne, a duo well-suited to sugar and lemons. But when the combination was given the French 75 moniker, its fate was sealed as a classic. That said, it’s possible that the first French 75s didn’t contain gin at all. Cognac and Champagne were also fast friends, and some recipe books call for cognac in place of gin. This much is certain: Both spirits make an excellent French 75, so mix whichever version you prefer. Today the French 75 is a fixture in cocktail bars, but it’s also a fan-favorite during brunch. The effervescent drink offers a boozier kick than a Mimosa , while still providing ultimate refreshment before, during and after your eggs Benedict. Whenever you choose to drink the French 75—and whichever spirit you choose as its base—this is one classic you’ll want to rediscover again and again.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/oaxacan-old-fashioned/,Oaxaca Old Fashioned,Kevin Gray,"The Oaxaca Old Fashioned helped kick off the mezcal craze in the United States. Created in 2007 by New York bartender Phil Ward, the Oaxaca Old Fashioned introduced countless drinkers to the earthy spirit, which was unfamiliar to most consumers at the time. Ward first made the cocktail at Death & Co., the pioneering East Village bar, before placing it on the menu at Mayahuel, the dearly departed bar that he opened down the street. The Oaxaca Old Fashioned—named for the Mexican state from where most mezcals hail—is a riff on the classic whiskey Old Fashioned . It mixes reposado tequila, which is lightly aged in oak and mimics some of those oaky flavors present in the classic Old Fashioned, and mezcal with Angostura bitters and agave nectar. The Differences Between Blanco, Reposado, and Añejo Tequila RELATED ARTICLE Notably, the drink only contains a half ounce of mezcal while featuring a full pour of tequila, but this was part of its appeal. The cocktail turned newcomers on to mezcal while wrapping it in the security blanket of its more common cousin. This strategy helped the spirit proliferate at Death & Co. and then Mayahuel, which took the training wheels off and served a menu dedicated to agave spirits and cocktails. Today, mezcal cocktails are a common sight on bar menus, and many bars proudly pour dozens of mezcals across a range of styles. The Oaxaca Old Fashioned played a role in making that happen, and all these years after its creation, it still holds up. The drink is as delicious, balanced and relevant as ever. Be sure to choose a good reposado tequila and a flavorful mezcal with notes of citrus and smoke (Ward’s original recipe featured Del Maguey Mezcal San Luis Del Rio). Then go the extra mile and ignite your orange peel garnish for an added burst of flavor, plus a pretty cool light show—just like Mayahuel served it.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'reposado tequila (preferably El Tesoro)'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal (preferably Del Maguey San Luis Del Rio)'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, mezcal, agave nectar and Angostura bitters to an Old Fashioned glass with one large ice cube, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Flame an orange peel over the top of the drink to express its oils, then garnish with the peel.']",147,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/maple-old-fashioned/,Maple Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"In a historical sense, the Old Fashioned is the Platonic form of a cocktail. Its ingredients comprise spirit, bitters, sugar and water, a cocktail in the truest sense of the word. Originally made with any number of spirits, often brandy, over the decades the idea of an Old Fashioned became codified into including whiskey, generally bourbon. And while the Bourbon Old Fashioned does reign as king even today, there are alternatives. And one such exemplar is the Rum Old Fashioned . There’s a lot to be said about making your Old Fashioned with an aged rum. Like bourbon it sees time in a barrel, which smooths out its harsher edges, adds notes of vanilla and caramel, and increases its depth and complexity, all of which leads to a beautiful marriage with bitters, some sweetener and orange zest. Also, possibly even more so than with whiskey, using an aged rum means versatility. Want something odd and funky? Try playing with Jamaican rums, many of which possess a funk that is referred to as hogo . Looking for something a little more similar to whiskey? Then opt for a gold rum from Barbados, where rums are often aged in whiskey barrels. Want an Old Fashioned that will knock your socks off? Try it with a navy-strength rum (though you’ll really want to limit yourself to only one if you go this route). In this version of the drink from Allen Katz, co-founder of New York Distilling Company, it’s more than just the base spirit that gets substituted. The Maple Old Fashioned, as the name would suggest, swaps the more commonly used simple syrup (or sugar cube) for Canada’s greatest export: maple syrup. When using maple syrup rather than simple, a little goes a long way. The sweetness of maple syrup can vary, so it’s best to to start with less and add more. You can always make a drink sweeter, but unless you want to keep adding more rum, it’s hard to make it less sweet. While a simple recipe, the versatility of rum in this drink creates some fun opportunity to experiment. Mix a flight of smaller Maple Old Fashioneds—each with a different rum and even different bitters—and decide which is your favorite. Does a darker rum elicit a more satisfying drink? Is a lighter rum better for afternoon quaffing? And after you tried the Maple Old Fashioned, why not try your hand at one of the many other variations on the classic drink, like a brandy-based Wisconsin Old Fashioned , or one made with brown butter-washed bourbon ?

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spiced-old-fashioned/,Spiced Old Fashioned,Céline Bossart,"Industry veteran Jacques Bezuidenhout takes the classic Old Fashioned and turns it on its head with his Spiced Old Fashioned recipe, which uses tequila as the base spirit and brings layers of serious heat into the mix. For him, it’s second nature to find harmony between the tried and true classics and his personal love affair with tequila. The Spiced Old Fashioned is the ultimate representation of the magic that can happen when bartenders think outside the box—the primary contributor to the continued evolution of an industry that loves to keep us on our toes. When it comes to adding spice to a drink, it’s important to keep balance in mind as you build, whether you’re using fresh ingredients, preserves, tinctures, syrups, bitters or infusions. Of course, this is key in all cocktails, but especially those with a heat factor—you want the spice to add to the experience, not overpower other flavors. Bezuidenhout has done the legwork here with this recipe—his Spiced Old Fashioned is bright and nuanced with deep, woodsy notes, bright pops of citrus, and subtle baking spices, all braced by piquant Fresno chile—but if you want to adjust the spice level, proceed with caution. In general, you’ll want to take things slow and add little by little when modifying a recipe, because it’s much easier to continue adding than it is to take away if you find that you’ve gone too far. This how-to video, guided by Beziudenhout himself, is the perfect primer for any foray into both riffing on classics and working with spicy ingredients, so give it a watch before diving in.

It includes the fundamental elements that make a drink a cocktail—spirits, bitters, sugar, and ice. The traditionally bourbon-based drink is also incredibly versatile, lending itself to countless variations like the Autumn Old Fashioned. This seasonal riff comes from Beau Williams of Kansas City, Missouri’s Julep Cocktail Club , who brings the best of fall’s flavors together with an aged rum, apple cider syrup, and Angostura bitters. Why The Autumn Old Fashioned Works This drink relies on the classic Old Fashioned formula of aged spirit, sweetener, and bitters, which work together to create a spirit-forward and richly-flavored drink. Aged rum stands in for the typical whiskey—William’s choice of Mount Gay XO blended rum is aged in casks including ex-bourbon and American whiskey barrels, so it’s a natural replacement for bourbon. 20 Cocktails to Make This Fall RELATED ARTICLE For the sweet element, Williams replaces sugar or simple syrup with a homemade apple cider syrup, which comes together easily in a saucepan with apple cider and brown sugar. While delicious in a cocktail, it can also be further reduced and drizzled over pancakes and waffles. As with any Old Fashioned, a few dashes of bitters are the finishing touch. Williams keeps a traditional approach here, opting for three dashes of aromatic Angostura bitters, which lend fall-appropriate baking spice notes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/irish-old-fashioned/,Irish Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"The Old Fashioned : a timeless, time-honored drink that, for some, is the best format for displaying the quality and nuances of a particular spirit. Sugar and bitters both enhance a liquor’s individual characteristics, especially when those ingredients are carefully paired with the base spirit. Ice mellows the heat of the liquor while the slow dilution allows for the subtleties to come through. Order an Old Fashioned in a bar without specifying your liquor of choice, and chances are you’ll be handed one made with bourbon. Most people’s minds go to whiskey in an Old Fashioned, though there are many exceptions, like the brandy Old Fashioneds served in Wisconsin or the rising trend of the Rum Old Fashioned . And it makes sense: whiskey just fits in the drink. But for whatever reason, most of the time it’s an American whiskey, like rye or the aforementioned bourbon. But this Old Fashioned from bartender Jack McGarry take a different route, reaching across the sea to the Emerald Isle for that often misunderstood category of spirits: Irish whiskey. In particular, McGarry uses Jameson Black Barrel Irish Whiskey. Even the most casual drinkers of Irish spirits will recognize the name Jameson, the most popular Irish whiskey on the market. But the Black Barrel isn’t the standard Jameson bottle that lines the shelves of everything from dive bars to cocktail lounges. Instead it’s aged 12 years in ex bourbon and sherry barrels, giving it far more depth and nuance. Since Irish whiskey already has a bit more sweetness than most bourbons, the drink doesn’t need a lot of sweetener. Rather than the traditional simple syrup used in Old Fashioneds, this recipe calls for Benedictine. This herbal liqueur plays well with the whiskey, adding some sweetness as well as a botanical depth that is further enhanced by both Angostura and orange bitters.

Served all over the world, it’s as popular now as it was more than a century ago. Part of its appeal is that, even though the drink is steeped in tradition, it offers endless personalization opportunities to the adventurous consumer. Some Old Fashioned purists scoff at the notion of featuring a non-whiskey spirit in the drink, but the Old Fashioned is really more of a template than an exact recipe. Composed of a spirit, sugar, water and bitters—the same formula as the first recorded definition of the word “cocktail”—the drink can be customized liberally and still work. The famous bartender and author, Jerry Thomas, even included an Old Fashioned made with Holland gin in the 1862 edition of his classic book, “The Bartenders Guide.” So, it’s time to set aside the idea that whiskey is the only Old Fashioned option. Otherwise, you might miss out on excellent reconsiderations like the Oaxacan Old Fashioned constructed with tequila and mezcal, or this Rum Old Fashioned made with, yes, rum. There are as many ways to make the Rum Old Fashioned as there are rums, sweeteners and bitters, but this version calls for dark rum, demerara syrup, allspice dram and two kinds of bitters: orange and Angostura. Dark rum presents oaky notes from aging in barrels, which should appeal to whiskey drinkers, and the allspice dram lends an additional layer of spice and complexity. Simple syrup will suffice, but demerara syrup made from raw cane sugar provides a richer taste and mouthfeel. Finally, the doubled-up bitters bring structure and balance in the form of zesty citrus and bold aromatics. This may not be the Old Fashioned you’re used to, but it’s an Old Fashioned whose acquaintance you’ll want to make.

Yet for all its tradition and history, the Old Fashioned is also a drink that undergoes endless experimentation. Fortunately, many of those experiments yield positive results, like the Oaxacan Old Fashioned , a modern success story featuring tequila and mezcal. This Spiced Tequila Old Fashioned takes a similar path. It comes from Matt Armato, a blogger and recipe developer and the co-founder of Probably This . He gives the classic drink a Mexican makeover, reaching for reposado tequila, allspice dram and orange bitters. Reposado tequilas are aged between two months and one year in oak barrels, lending them a softer, rounder profile than unaged blancos, with hints of oaky sweetness and spice. Allspice dram —also called pimento dram—is a popular addition to Tiki drinks, but it works well in a variety of cocktails. The liqueur is typically made with a rum base and flavored with allspice berries, which taste like a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. These baking spice notes merge with the reposado tequila to create a full and spicy cocktail. Add some orange bitters for zesty zing and complexity, and you have a new take on the OId Fashioned.

But this botanical, juniper-laced spirit isn’t just for old-school drinks; it’s also a favorite of today’s bartenders, who enlist the flavorful liquor in countless modern recipes. Part of gin’s draw is that its powerful profile stands up tall in cocktails, but it also plays well with other ingredients, from liqueurs and fortified wines to fresh citrus. You can see its versatility on full display in the C&B Old Fashioned, an original recipe from New York bartending veteran and distiller Allen Katz. The C&B Old Fashioned is named for the cocktail’s use of Campari and Benedictine, but the drink also calls for Lillet Blanc and Cointreau in addition to the gin. If you’re counting, that’s one spirit, three liqueurs, and a wine-based aperitif. The ingredients are stirred with ice, strained, topped with club soda and garnished with an orange twist. Campari is a bitter Italian liqueur that is bright-red and made from a proprietary blend of herbs and spices, with dominant notes of bitter orange. Benedictine is a French liqueur made from a secret blend of 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon and juniper, and has a sweet, herbal profile. Lillet Blanc is a light, wine-based aperitif, and Cointreau is an 80-proof orange liqueur famous for its use in the Margarita . This recipe includes a lot of strong flavors, but each bottle is used deftly to achieve harmony, and the club soda topper lends some dilution and bubbles for additional balance and mouthfeel. The C&B Old Fashioned isn’t the typical whiskey Old Fashioned you’re probably used to. Besides the name, it doesn’t have much in common with the classic.

To incorporate one into the other, Brow heats unsalted butter in a saucepan until it has a nutty aroma. She then adds the browned butter to a bottle of bourbon, freezes the mixture and skims off the solids until she’s left with a rich, buttery whiskey. “ Old Fashioneds are such a staple in the South and particularly New Orleans, so I chose to incorporate the flavors together in the glass,” she says. Brown sugar lends an earthy sweetness to this drink, while Angostura bitters and a muddled Luxardo maraschino cherry lend spice and rich fruit.

Allen muddles an orange slice in the cocktail, a choice that is controversial when making the classic Old Fashioned but in this case adds a welcome touch of bright citrus flavor that pairs deftly with the bourbon.

The cubes are stirred with the other ingredients to chill and dilute the drink, and the concoction is also served over a smoky cube for good measure. “As the smoke flavor from the aromatic infusion dissipates, the cocktail slowly infuses with the water from the smoked ice and maintains the prominence of smoke throughout the entirety of the cocktail experience,” says owner Logan Thies. The orange flavor comes from Aperol , which replaces the orange zest in the classic recipe. “The brightening that the citrus oil introduces is beautiful, but I wanted to make the drink more defined and complex while staying true to its nature,” he says. The concept of using ice to create an evolving cocktail is one that’s been used around the world in countless formats and flavor combinations. In fact, we’ve even seen cocktails entirely encased in ice, which is another level of drink mastery reserved for those who like to put on a show (and have the time and patience to do so). Even when it’s not playing a major role in a drink’s appearance or taste, ice is always critical to the cocktail experience and is an art form worth studying. So break out your finest ice tray and start prepping for the Bourbon Toscano, which will inevitably make these smoked cubes a staple in your freezer.","[{'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Smoked ice cubes'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dehydrated rosemary sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dehydrated orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into an Old Fashioned glass over the smoked ice cubes.', 'Garnish with a dehydrated rosemary sprig and dehydrated orange wheel.']",13,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/expense-of-honesty/,Expense of Honesty,Liquor.com,"Strategic Hospitality beverage director Matthew Tocco says he’s noticed that guests are less apt to order a cocktail if it has rum or brandy as a base. Whiskey, however, is always popular. So when experimenting with Old Fashioned riffs at Nashville’s Pinewood Social , he decided to pair rum—two rums, actually—with bourbon to make his Expense of Honesty cocktail more appealing. Tocco starts with Brugal añejo rum from the Dominican Republic. It’s aged in ex-bourbon casks and leans drier than many rums. He also employs Arehucas Ron Miel Guanche, a honey-laced rum that hails from the Canary Islands. He found it sitting on a desk at a distributor’s office and thought it would be a great addition to the drink. For the bourbon, Tocco opts for Old Forester Signature: It’s spicy, robust and 100-proof, so it packs a punch. He finishes the cocktail with demerara sugar, honey and two kinds of bitters. “Rum is a product that comes from sugar, so pairing it with sugar makes sense,” he says of the demerara. And honey is a natural choice to pair with the honeyed Ron Miel Guanche. “A lot of people associate rum with sweet, fruity drinks, but there are a lot of different ways you can apply the spirit.” He suggests exploring the category by tasting several different rums to find those that work best for your palate. While you undertake this noble journey, make the Expense of Honesty and you’ll see that, sometimes, two rums are better than one.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-paper-plane/,Paper Plane,Liquor.com,"One might imagine that the Paper Plane, considering the drink’s ubiquity among bartenders and at cocktail bars, were a storied classic. However, it was only invented in 2008. The inventor: Sam Ross , an award-winning bartender and the co-owner of Attaboy and Diamond Reef in New York City. The Paper Plane is a modern variation on the Last Word , a classic, equal-parts drink composed of gin, lime, maraschino liqueur and green Chartreuse. At first glance, the bourbon-spiked Paper Plane might not seem too similar. But it follows the same template and consists of equal parts bourbon, Amaro Nonino, Aperol and lemon juice. Both drinks strike a beautiful balance between bitter, sour and herbal notes. Although Ross typically holds court in NYC, he created the cocktail for the menu of The Violet Hour in Chicago. He was inspired by M.I.A.’s smash hit “Paper Plane,” which was popular at the time, and he even garnished the drink with a little paper plane. Guests enjoyed the cocktail, so Ross brought it with him when he went back to New York. He served it at Milk & Honey, and the cocktail’s following proliferated from there. When making the Paper Plane, Ross likes to use a slightly higher-proof bourbon—one in the 43% to 46% ABV range—as heft adds body. He also warns not to overshake the drink: You want it cold, but not watery. With that in mind, you can try making one for yourself. Made with equal parts of each ingredient, it’s an easy exercise. Bourbon and lemon juice are mainstays in most home bars. Aperol, as the backbone of the popular Aperol Spritz, is easy to come by. Amaro Nonino is a friendly, bittersweet ingredient that adds a unique element to the cocktail. This liqueur is made from a base of grappa and includes notes of botanicals, alpine herbs and orange peel. Mix the components together for a lesson in flavor and balance. The bourbon is present, but not overwhelming, making the Paper Plane a great gateway cocktail for drinkers who are new to whiskey. And while it’s still a relatively new drink, its impact has been significant. Don’t be surprised if it sticks around for decades to come.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mint-julep/,Mint Julep,Liquor.com,"The Mint Julep is a bourbon cocktail best known for being the signature drink of the Kentucky Derby . But this refresher composed of bourbon, sugar, mint and crushed ice shouldn’t be reserved for only one day a year. The Mint Julep gained prominence in the southern United States during the 18th century, and it first appeared in print in 1803 in John Davis’ book “Travels of Four and a Half Years in the United States of America.” He wrote that the Mint Julep is a “dram of spirituous liquor that has mint steeped in it, taken by Virginians of a morning.” An ice-cold whiskey drink is certainly one way to start your day. Since its creation, the Mint Julep has remained popular, but the julep itself is actually a category of drinks featuring a spirit served over crushed ice. So, it comes in more varieties than only bourbon and mint, and it’s likely that the first juleps were made with cognac or even peach brandy. After the phylloxera epidemic of the mid-1800s, which infected France’s grapevines and temporarily hindered that counry’s cognac trade, whiskey became the julep’s go-to liquor. The Mint Julep is traditionally served in a rocks glass or, ideally, in a silver julep cup. Since bourbon is the only liquid in the drink, you’ll want to use a high-quality bottle that you know you love. A slightly higher-proof bourbon—something in the mid-80s or around 90—will keep the crushed ice from diluting the cocktail too quickly. This recipe comes from San Diego bartender Erick Castro. Try making it for yourself, and see how a few ingredients can combine for ultimate refreshment. Sure, the Mint Julep is typically consumed on Derby Day, but don’t let that keep you from enjoying one whenever the mood strikes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/milk-honey-2/,Milk & Honey,Liquor.com,"Oh, the elegant simplicity of a two-ingredient drink, especially one that doesn’t involve any stirring or shaking. There’s not much labor involved in making the Milk & Honey cocktail, but it delivers in flavor and complexity. It’s best enjoyed as a nightcap or a dessert, and while the recipe calls for the two ingredients to be poured over ice, alternatively it can be served hot, as a Toddy to warm your bones on cold nights. Simply heat the milk and omit the ice. The Milk & Honey starts with Benedictine , for which there is no substitution. This French herbal liqueur has nearly 30 ingredients, and only a small number of people alive know the complete list. Its base is cognac, and along with herbs like saffron, cinnamon and juniper it’s finished with honey, giving the drink its sweetness and part of its name. To the Benedictine, the drink gets a hefty splash of milk. Normally you’ll want to use whole milk for the richness and flavor. However, those who avoid dairy for any reason can swap it out for an alternative like almond or soy milk.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/crystal-ramos-gin-fizz/,Crystal Ramos Gin Fizz,Kat Odell,"“I’m not a big fan of creamy cocktails,” says Aki Eguchi, the bar program director for Singapore’s lauded Jigger & Pony Group and drinks maverick behind one of the city’s most innovative cocktails, a Crystal Ramos Gin Fizz. Eguchi created the drink back in 2015, when Gibson , currently No. 15 on Asia’s 50 Best Bars list, debuted. He was interested in reformulating a traditionally creamy cocktail into a lighter, more sessionable version. He initially considered clarifying a Piña Colada or Grasshopper but admits “they didn’t sound right to me."" Instead, Eguchi decided to pursue rejiggering the Ramos Gin Fizz ––the gin, cream and orange flower tipple invented in New Orleans back in 1888––through clarification. And now, four years later, this transparent tipple has become one of the group’s most iconic cocktails, currently on offer at Jigger & Pony, the group’s namesake bar and one that claims ninth place on Asia’s 50 Best Bars list. Named after the double-coned tool that bartenders use to accurately measure spirits, Jigger & Pony relocated from its original home in Chinatown to a more spacious new expanse in Tanjong Pagar’s Amara hotel last year. And with that transition, the bar team introduced a new menu divided into various sections, one of which includes customer favorites from across the Jigger & Pony family of bars: Enter the Crystal Ramos Gin Fizz. Bearing the floral flavors of a traditional Ramos Gin Fizz, conveyed through spices and citrus peel, with a full body but light mouthfeel and a garnish of orange blossom bubbles, Eguchi’s progressive take on one of the world’s most celebrated cocktails is a revelation.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '6 3/4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'clarified gin milk punch'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange blossom bubbles', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a carbonator bottle, combine gin, clarified gin milk punch and 3/4 cup water and carbonate.', 'Pour into a large tulip glass.', 'Add one block of ice.', 'Garnish with orange blossom bubbles.', '*Clarified gin milk punch: Combine 2 1/2 cups green tea, 3 1/3 cups Tanqueray gin, 300 g sugar, 1 cup Banks 5 Island Blend rum, 2/3 cup Sailor Jerry rum, 3 oz Koko Kanu rum, 3 oz La Fée bohemian-style absinthe, 2 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice, 18 pieces of 1x5 cm orange peel, 9 pieces of 1x5 cm lemon peel, 18 cloves, 1 1/2 pieces of star anise and 1 cinnamon stick in a large bowl.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/apprentice/,Apprentice,Alex Frane,"Bartender, activist and educator Ashtin Berry created the Apprentice while working as the beverage director at the Tokyo Record Bar . A riff on the Dark ’n Stormy , she created it as an homage to the izakaya cuisine at the New York City lounge where vinyl rules. She loves the way heat in food coaxes out white miso’s butterscotch notes. “The Dark ’n Stormy has this perfect blend of baking spiced fruit and ginger spice,” says Berry. “I decided to use the white miso and sweet potato notes of the shochu along with the bitterness of the Cynar liqueur to create a more savory version.” The Apprentice substitutes shochu for the rum with which a Dark ’n Stormy is normally made. The lightly sweet, lower proof spirit is very similar to Korean soju , and is usually made from sweet potato, barley or rice. If it’s not available in your area, it is acceptable to use soju instead, though it will subtly change the notes of the drink, especially if using a rice-based soju rather than one made from sweet potato. Miso might, on first glance, appear to make the drink salty or funky. But the minimal amount of miso that goes into the syrup only gives the drink increased depth and complexity. The recipe below makes two cups of the miso syrup, but that can easily be cut down if you’re not looking to make too many of these drinks. The richness and umami notes of the miso are balanced by the bright acid of yuzu juice. This East Asian citrus fruit that resembles a miniature yellow grapefruit can be difficult to find in the American market, though large Asian markets sometimes carry them or bottles of fresh yuzu juice. Online markets such as Amazon often carry it as well, though prices can be high even for smaller bottles of the juice. If unavailable, the closest, easiest substitute for yuzu is equal parts lime and lemon juice. After topping with club soda, a generous float of Cynar finishes the drink. This bittersweet Italian liqueur (with emphasis on the bitter) is famously made from the juice of artichokes, but you shouldn’t let that scare you—the ingredient gives it subtle vegetal notes, but nothing overwhelmingly “artichoke.” It does, however, give the drink a darker flushed hue than a standard Dark ’n Stormy, as well as some of the spice elements that it would normally get from ginger beer.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'shochu'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'miso syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'yuzu juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cynar'}]","['Add the shochu, miso syrup and yuzu juice to a cocktail shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the club soda.', 'Float the Cynar on top.']",0,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jeez-louise/,Jeez Louise,Kelly Magyarics,"What’s the blueprint for one of the most successful cocktail formulas ever? According to bartender Chris McMillian, the answer starts with the Brandy Crusta , which mixes brandy with lemon, curaçao, maraschino liqueur and Angostura bitters. Switch to cognac for a Sidecar or gin for a White Lady . Juice limes and add a healthy pour of tequila for the perfect Margarita , or shake it with vodka, cranberry and lime for a pink-hued Cosmopolitan —being perhaps the single most successful cocktail of the modern era. “That’s the beauty of these drinks, which are ‘Mr. Potato Head bartending,’” says McMillian, the owner of Revel Cafe & Bar in New Orleans. “As long as you’re only changing one element, it still works. Not every combo will be brilliant, but your drink won’t suck, and every now and again, you get lucky.” Their common element is orange liqueur as a modifying sweetening agent. So just what would the next iteration look like? At first, McMillian, who is also the founder of The Museum of the American Cocktail , half-jokingly said it should be made with amaro as the base. He then realized it made perfect sense in the current cocktail climate. “The embrace of the bitter is about 10 years old,” says McMillian. “This element of flavor is now mainstream as opposed to experimental.” He had initially been resistant to amaro drinks and was late to the party in adopting them. But when he read that renowned bartender Audrey Saunders and cocktail expert Robert Hess substituted Branca Menta for crème de menthe in the Grasshopper , it gave him permission to flout the rules. McMillian started his modern sour with Averna but found it just wasn’t quite bitter enough. Adding a splash of Cynar, the Italian liqueur made with artichoke and 12 other herbs and plants, was the intense solution. Cointreau lends the signature orange flavor, and lime juice keeps it tart. He serves it in a Collins glass over ice with a splash of soda, garnished with half an orange wheel for color and flavor. The drink is called the Jeez Louise, that less blasphemous exclamation of exasperation. It’s a classic libation that reintroduces itself in every era depending on what base spirit is on trend. McMillian likens it to a conversation he had with his teenage son, who told him excitedly that he had just heard “the greatest song by Sublime called ‘Summertime.’” McMillian reminded him that it was even better the first time around when Cole Porter performed it. “These drinks transcend generations; every generation exposed to them finds them compelling,” says McMillian. “Dinah Washington to Diana Krall, each generation interprets [these drinks] through the filter of what’s fashionable and popular.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/queen-elizabeth/,Queen Elizabeth,Liquor.com,"The Queen Elizabeth cocktail is not British, nor does it contain any British ingredients. Instead, it was created by a Philadelphia bartender, and two-thirds of the ingredients (the dry vermouth and Benedictine ) hail from France. This could be chalked up to another hazy, confusing cocktail backstory like so many others, but there’s some rhyme and reason behind its name and provenance. According to drinks historian and author, David Wondrich, the Queen Elizabeth came to life in 1934 when it was mixed together by Herbert Quack, bartender at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel in Philadelphia. The recipe was published the following year in a 1935 Esquire advertisement for Benedictine, a liqueur composed of 17 herbs and spices. The ad said: ""Here is the prize-winning recipe in a recent nationwide cocktail contest."" So, that explains that. And as for the title: It was named for the creator’s wife, not the monarch. Queen Elizabeth, the drink, skips a base spirit, instead calling on the lighter charms of dry vermouth and that Benedictine. The vermouth brings aromatic floral notes, while the Benedictine is sweet, with notes of baking spices and honey.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-murphy-sour/,Murphy Sour,Liquor.com,"H. Joseph Ehrmann is the proprietor of Elixir in San Francisco, the bar that he’s helmed since 2003. Over the years, he has created countless original cocktails for the bar’s menu, including the Murphy Sour, which is a twist on the classic Pisco Sour. The Pisco Sour calls for pisco, lime juice, simple syrup, egg white and bitters. Ehrmann’s version swerves from the original by incorporating muddled clementine and cilantro, plus a richer sweetener in the form of honey syrup. The resulting cocktail is fresh and invigorating, as the welcome one-two punch of tart clementine and herbal cilantro merges deftly with the dry pisco and silky egg white. One unique element of egg white cocktails is the dry shake, which involves shaking a cocktail first without ice before shaking it again with ice. That introductory step helps to emulsify the egg white with the other ingredients and creates the frothy head on top of the drink. In the case of the Pisco Sour, that head is a perfect palette for supporting a few drops of aromatic bitters; in the Murphy Sour, it acts as a soft bed for the cilantro leaf garnish. The Murphy Sour has been in Ehrmann’s repertoire for years, but in 2019 it was awarded Cocktail of the Year at the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, solidifying its place as one of the best original recipes to come out of the modern era. 6 Things You Should Know About the Pisco Sour RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'chopped fresh cilantro leaves'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'clementine'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pisco'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cilantro leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the cilantro and clementine.', 'Add the remaining ingredients and shake hard without ice for five seconds.', 'Fill with ice and shake again until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a cocktail glass and garnish with a cilantro leaf.']",8,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-sun-also-rises/,The Sun Also Rises,Liquor.com,"The Sun Also Rises is a liquid tribute to Ernest Hemingway and his 1926 novel of the same name. The cocktail was created by Jim Meehan, an award-winning bartender best known for his work at the seminal New York cocktail bar PDT and as the author of “ The PDT Cocktail Book ” and “ Meehan’s Bartender Manual .” The drink is a riff on the classic Hemingway Daiquiri, which features rum, lime juice, grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur. Meehan follows the same basic formula here, but he adds a small measure of absinthe. The absinthe lends extra weight and complexity to the drink, while also providing a hint of anise flavor and aroma. While the absinthe addition works well, it’s more than just a smart way to tweak the drink’s flavor. Hemingway is known to have consumed absinthe regularly during his time in France, Spain and Cuba. The spirit is also a key component of the Death in the Afternoon , a Hemingway original cocktail he made by combining absinthe and champagne. So, in making The Sun Also Rises, Meehan pays homage to two of Hemingway’s favorite drinks. You can do the same by mixing one up for yourself. Just don’t feel the need to imbibe as heavily as the man himself, who supposedly once downed 16 double Daiquiris in one sitting.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tommys-margarita/,Tommy’s Margarita,Liquor.com,"The traditional Margarita recipe features tequila, fresh lime juice, and orange liqueur, but as with most classics, bartenders and enthusiasts have found ways to riff on the original formula. One such twist has become a modern classic: Tommy’s Margarita, which was created by the legendary Julio Bermejo in the early ’90s at his family’s San Francisco restaurant Tommy’s Mexican. Sweetened solely with agave nectar, the Tommy’s Margarita is characterized by its lack of orange liqueur. It also calls for 100% agave tequila that is free of refined sugar or additives. These simple choices create a slightly less sweet cocktail that puts the focus on tequila while saving the drinker a few calories. In the ’90s, the Tommy’s Margarita became emblematic of a lighter, fresher style of eating and drinking that was taking place in California and which still drives much of the culinary and bar scene today. 28 Cocktails to Make with Tequila RELATED ARTICLE Like the classic, the Tommy’s Margarita is typically shaken and served on the rocks in a salt-rimmed glass. Tommy’s, which offers one of the largest agave spirits selections in the world, still serves the drink in droves, but its signature Margarita has become a bar staple well beyond San Francisco. The cocktail is now served all over the world, as countless establishments and bartenders have followed Bermejo’s lead, focusing on the holy trinity of 100% agave tequila, agave nectar, and fresh lime juice. Bermejo’s original recipe has become one of the most popular Margarita variations for good reason—it’s fresh, easy to drink, and tastes unmistakably of agave.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'salt', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rub the rim of a rocks glass with a lime wedge, dip the rim in salt to coat, and set aside.', 'Add the tequila, lime juice, and agave nectar to a shaker with ice.', 'Shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain over fresh ice into the prepared glass.']",180,tequila

We’re talking about the real deal. Not an AMF or an Adios, Mother F’er, as the drink is called in more squeamish circles. And certainly not the more family-friendly Walk Me Down. You can’t soften the seven-syllable force of a fully articulated Adios, Motherfucker. The drink is bold, boozy and blue. Featuring five—yes, five—alcoholic components, it’s very similar to the Long Island Iced Tea . But where the LIIT calls for triple sec and cola, this cocktail requires a slug of blue curaçao and a topper of Sprite or 7UP. That curaçao swap results in the vibrant color, while the soda switch gives the drink a lighter, more citrusy flavor. The recipe specifically calls for sweet-and-sour mix. You can find bottled sweet-and-sours on store shelves, but it’s always a smart practice to stay away from those, as they’re loaded with sugar and additives. Instead, try making your own. That is easily accomplished by making a quick simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water) and infusing it with fresh lime juice.

The Gin & Tonic , Whiskey Highball and many other simple cocktails prove the point. Consider the Backyard Iced Tea. This laidback refreshment bolsters your DIY repertoire with a thirst-quenching combination of spiced rum, lemonade and iced tea. Take one sip, and you’ll want to break the drink out whenever hot weather requires liquid abatement. Essentially a spirited take on the Arnold Palmer (iced tea and lemonade), the Backyard Iced Tea doesn’t require much thought or effort, but it does allow for customization. Any bottle of your favorite spiced rum will do. From there, you can pull a bottle of iced tea from the fridge or take the extra step to brew your own. Unsweetened iced tea is the best way to go, as the cocktail receives plenty of sweetness from the rum and lemonade. About that lemonade: If you want to use a store-bought version, choose one that you enjoy drinking on its own, ideally without too many artificial ingredients or additives. But if you’re open to squeezing some lemons, you can take this drink up a notch. Fresh lemonade—a simple merger of lemon juice, sugar and water—lets you dial in the tartness and rich citrus to your preferences. The Backyard Iced Tea can be a solo endeavor, but because it is so easy to put together, you can make a large batch in a pitcher and dole out individual servings over ice.

Vodka, of course, tends to shape-shift based on its fellow ingredients—in the case of the Banker’s Lunch, what the base spirit lacks in flavor it makes up for in strength, serving as the backbone of the cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/1870-sour/,1870 Sour,Liquor.com,"The New York Sour is an interesting concept—merely by adding a layer of red wine to a classic Whiskey Sour , it has crafted a new family of drinks . The 1870 Sour is one such variation, a Tennessee whiskey sour that replaces the familiar simple syrup with a mix of maple syrup and blueberry jam. The 1870 Sour comes from bartending veteran Dominic Venegas. The drink begins with Tennessee whiskey, a kind of bourbon that is charcoal-filtered for extra smoothness and a mellowing of its heat. Jack Daniels is the most famous producer of Tennessee whiskey, but Venegas uses George Dickel Old No. 8 instead, a lauded brand in the category, instead. Also unlike a traditional New York Sour, Venegas uses Meyer lemon juice—this winter citrus is sweeter than your usual grocery store lemons, so the drink is less puckering. This is aided by the maple syrup and a small amount of blueberry jam, which adds depth in addition to sugar. One of the main draws of a New York Sour is its visuals, with the egg white adding a thick white foam layer and the red wine adding a crimson band atop the drink. But another unique aspect of the 1870 Sour—and one that gives it a rustic, old-world feel—is the vessel. Rather than a cocktail coupe or rocks glass with a large cube, Venegas opts for an 8-ounce Mason jar or a Bourdeaux wine glass. Either container will show off the drink’s beautiful stratifications. When it comes time to top the drink with the red wine, Venegas uses Ravenswood Sonoma County old vine zinfandel. A nice California wine with a reasonable price tag and large-scale distribution, it’s a solid choice. But feel free to use whatever kind of bold, fruit-forward red wine you have around, especially if you plan on opening it for dinner after a round (or two) of the 1870 Sour. 5 New York Sour Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'George Dickel Old No. 8 Tennessee whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Meyer lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'egg white'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'blueberry jam'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ravenswood Sonoma County old vine zinfandel'}]","['Add the George Dickel Tennessee whiskey, Meyer lemon juice, maple syrup, egg white and blueberry jam into a shaker and dry-shake (without ice) for 10 seconds.', 'Fill the shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled 8-ounce Mason jar or a Bordeaux wine glass.', 'Float the wine on top using a spoon.']",15,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/west-side/,West Side,Dushan Zaric,"About 10 years ago, I would feel really bad charging for a Sidecar or a Negroni . I’d get one order a year for a classic cocktail. And instead of ringing up the sale, I wanted to thank the customer for allowing me to hone my skills. At the time, vodka ruled and just about everything was called a “tini.” People were enjoying Cosmos , French Martinis and Dirty Martinis , but generally had very little idea of what they were drinking. Vodka cocktails were simple and not overly complex, with just enough mixer to mask the alcohol taste. Many bartenders tend to look down on vodka now. The arguments range from the historical—vodka wasn’t traditionally used in cocktails—to the artistic—vodka is like tofu, since a drink’s entire flavor comes from the other ingredients. What’s worse is if you order a vodka drink, some bartenders take it as a personal insult and a sign of bad taste. What these mixologists so easily forget is that if it wasn’t for the popularity of vodka cocktails in the ’90s, we wouldn’t have a resurgence of classic cocktails. Bar menus are full of creative drinks that call for a wide variety of spirits but, as any bartender can tell you, vodka cocktails are still the biggest sellers. I believe that vodka is here to stay. But you don’t just have to use the spirit in Screwdrivers and Cosmos. For example, try my recipe for the West Side, a really tasty lemon and mint vodka cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-rickey/,Gin Rickey,Liquor.com,"The Gin Rickey is one of the few classic cocktails that doesn’t have an origin muddled by history or shrouded in rumors and innuendo. The invention of this refreshing highball is refreshingly clear: It was named after Joe Rickey, a Democratic lobbyist living in Washington, D.C., during the late 19th century. Favoring zero-sugar drinks, Rickey liked to combine bourbon and carbonated water. One day, he instructed a bartender at Shoomaker’s bar to add some lime to his preferred highball, and the Bourbon Rickey was born. The tart, dry drink is surprisingly balanced considering its lack of sugar and is invigorating on a warm day. The Rickey took off, and soon, people were customizing the drink to their liking, with the Gin Rickey eventually becoming the most popular of them all. This simple twist subs gin for bourbon, taking advantage of the botanical spirit’s natural ability to pair with fresh lime (consider the Gimlet ) and sparkling water (think of the Tom Collins ). Sugar is present in both the aforementioned cocktails, but the Rickey stands on its own, relying on the gin and lime for flavor and the water for dilution and balance. 10 Refreshing Gin Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE When making a Rickey, feel free to choose your preferred style of gin. A London dry is always a fine choice, while more citrusy and floral gins will add their own nuance to the cocktail. Fresh lime is a must, and a good sparkling water—ideally from a bottle rather than a soda gun—keeps the drink fizzy and thirst-quenching. The Gin Rickey remained a popular drink for decades, even appearing in the 1925 classic, “The Great Gatsby,” when Tom Buchanan served his guests a platter of Rickeys. In 2011, more than a century after its creation, the Rickey was officially declared Washington D.C.’s native cocktail, and today, it’s still a common serve in D.C. and beyond.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rum-punch/,Rum Punch,Dylan Garret,"The classic Rum Punch is arguably the most flexible, easiest to make iteration of one of the world's oldest types of cocktails. Punches have written references dating to at least the 17th century, before the advent of many modern bartending tools, ingredients, or even easily accessible ice. They traditionally feature a spirit, citrus, spice, sugar and water. This loose template offers the creative drinker a wide berth for experimentation. But if you need some inspiration, you can’t go wrong with rum and fruit juice, which are as perfect a pairing as you’ll find in the cocktail-verse. Why Rum Punch Works Rum, on the whole, mixes well with many ingredients, but it particularly favors a variety of fruit juices. Fermented and distilled from sugar cane juice or molasses, rum has a long history of production in the world's tropical regions. This makes it a natural fit for other ingredients that grow in the same climates, from lemons and limes to orange, mango, pineapple, ginger, and various spices like cloves, allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Simply put, the wealth of popular ingredients that share regionality with rum is also what makes it so amenable to a wealth of combinations. Punches don't have to be served in massive, large-batch formats , but the more-is-more approach to many common recipes and their ingredients mean that they tend to be easily scalable for larger crowds. This single-serving Rum Punch uses both light and dark rum—a smart and easy way to add depth and complexity to a cocktail. From there, pineapple and grenadine lend sweetness, orange juice brightens everything, and a lime cuts through the sugars and tropical sweetness to create a refreshingly tart profile. How to Make Homemade Grenadine RELATED ARTICLE Grenadine: Store-Bought or Homemade? About that grenadine: Most store-bought versions are bright red, overly sweet and weighted with artificial ingredients. While they can get the job done in a pinch, if you have the time it's always better to leave those commercial options on the shelf and create your own. It takes just a few minutes to make homemade grenadine with pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses and sugar. It’s worth the effort, as DIY grenadine adds a tart richness to cocktails that can’t be matched with the pre-bottled stuff. Entertaining a crowd? Simply scale up the measurements to fit your punch bowl, or multiply by how many people you want to serve. Drop a large ice block into the bowl to keep your refreshment cold, garnish with a few slices of fresh fruit and you’ll have a Rum Punch that will last the duration.","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'light rum'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dark rum'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add light rum, dark rum, pineapple, orange and lime juices, and grenadine into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Hurricane glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a maraschino or brandied cherry.']",355,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tequila-sunrise/,Tequila Sunrise,Liquor.com,"The Tequila Sunrise cocktail, with its bright striations of color, evokes a summer sunrise. This classic drink has only three ingredients—tequila, grenadine, and orange juice—and is served unmixed to preserve the color of each layer. The Tequila Sunrise was created in the early 1970s by Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice at the Trident bar in Sausalito, California. The cocktail achieved notoriety after a member of the Rolling Stones—in some tellings it was Mick Jagger, while others have it as Keith Richards—tasted it at a party to kick off The Rolling Stones’ 1972 tour. The band began ordering it at stops across the country and even dubbed the tour “the cocaine and Tequila Sunrise tour,” which helped to propel the drink’s popularity. In 1973, Jose Cuervo put the recipe on the back of its tequila bottles, and that same year, the Eagles released a song called “Tequila Sunrise” on their “Desperado” album. These infusions into popular culture resulted in the drink going mainstream, and it has been a part of the cocktail canon ever since. The History and Secrets of the Tequila Sunrise RELATED ARTICLE The Tequila Sunrise is easy to make but must be constructed precisely in order to achieve the desired sunrise look. Tequila and then orange juice (fresh is best) are added to a highball glass filled with ice. Grenadine is applied last, but due to its density, it sinks to the bottom, creating a red layer at the base of the glass. If you want to spruce up the drink, skip the bottled bright-red grenadine available on store shelves and try making your own .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bacardi-cocktail/,Bacardí Cocktail,Ben Schaffer,"The Bacardí Cocktail became one of the most popular drinks in America immediately following the repeal of Prohibition. It is a variation of the Daiquiri that involves rum, lime and grenadine in place of sugar, and though a rare sight on menus today, it was a stalwart of the 1930s bar repertoire. Its origin, however, can be traced back to a couple decades prior to Repeal Day. On November 13, 1913, The Oakland Tribune reported on a new cocktail containing Puerto Rican rum, lime juice and grenadine that had been imported from New York. While the Bacardí Cocktail wasn’t specifically named, that may be the first written account of the drink. Soon after, the Bacardí Cocktail appeared in the 1914 edition of "" Drinks ,"" specifying Bacardí rum as the base spirit. It continued to be included in other influential works throughout the decade, solidifying its place in the history books. By the time the 1930s rolled around, Americans—especially those who drank in Havana during America’s dry years or those who’d already sampled the Bacardí Cocktail—were thirsty for the familiar recipe. In New York, it became a top-selling staple at many bars. However, the brand soon realized that not every Bacardí Cocktail actually contained Bacardí rum. This posed a problem for the brand, who acted by issuing law suits in 1936 against the establishments pouring Bacardí-less Bacardí Cocktails. They won, and the Bacardí Cocktail became a government-protected drink, similar to the Dark and Stormy , which can only be made with Gosling’s rum. When making the cocktail today, it’s best to use homemade grenadine rather than the artificial, bright red versions you’ll find in stores. Real grenadine is rich, delicious and typically less sweet than most commercial options. It’s also closer to what people would’ve been drinking back in the 1930s, when the Bacardí Cocktail was king.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mary-pickford/,Mary Pickford,Céline Bossart,"Mary Pickford, a classic rum cocktail, is known to be sweet but with a kick—not unlike like its namesake. The most popular origin story for this tropical favorite goes like this: In early 1920s Cuba, the Mary Pickford cocktail was created and named for the pioneering star, who was working on a film in Havana at the time with husband Douglas Fairbanks (as was Charlie Chaplin, Fairbanks’ best friend). The bartender responsible, as happens with most classic drinks, is somewhat debated. In this case, it comes down to two local bartenders: Eddie Woelke and Fred Kaufman, though Kaufman tends to get the lion’s share of the credit. While the Cuba story is a fun one, Vanity Fair reports that “a thorough review of Mary and Doug’s schedule reveals no trips to Cuba—and they never made a film there during their marriage.” This throws a wrench in the tale, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that the drink wasn’t made in Pickford’s honor. We do know that the Mary Pickford cocktail first appeared in print in 1928 with the publishing of Basil Woon’s cocktail book, “When It’s Cocktail Time in Cuba,” and again in the 1930 edition of “The Savoy Cocktail Book” by legendary bartender Harry Craddock.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/serpent-less-swizzle/,Serpent-less Swizzle,Liquor.com,"Among the pantheon of fruity rum concoctions, the Rum Swizzle is an icon. The national drink of Bermuda, it’s is a straightforward and adaptable mix of rums, fruit juices and usually a sweetener that’s not simple syrup— grenadine and falernum are two popular choices. The category gets its name from the way the drinks are stirred (or more accurately, swizzled) with a forked stick over crushed or pebble ice. But like many drinks that normally rely on a specific base spirit (in this case, rum), the swizzle is an opportunity to try other liquors . The Serpent-less Swizzle gives the template an Irish makeover, swapping the rum for Irish whiskey and adding in a few choice ingredients. The Serpent-less Swizzle comes from New Orleans bartender Nick Dietrich, and it starts with the 12 Year Old Special Reserve whiskey from Powers. It’s a fairly pricey whiskey to be mixing with lemon juice and grenadine, but it’s also exceptionally enjoyable. If need be, a more affordable Irish whiskey can be substituted, and an expression like the standard “gold label” Powers would work well. Another unique aspect of the Serpent-less Swizzle that differentiates it from others in the category is the use of vermouth. Dietrich uses Dolin blanc vermouth, which is sweeter and more citrus-forward than the dry. It adds a unique botanical element to the overall drink. Lemon juice adds the necessary acidity and brightness, while grenadine gives the drink additional sweetness. When shopping, skip the artificial grenadine that dominated the market for most of the later 20th Century, and pick up a version made with actual pomegranate. Or, if you have the time an inclination, try making your own —it’s extra work, but the results speak for themselves.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Powers 12 Year Old Special Reserve Irish whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dolin blanc vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'preserved cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Irish whiskey, Dolin blanc vermouth, lemon juice and grenadine into a Pilsner glass.', 'Fill with crushed ice and swizzle vigorously until slightly frothy.', 'Garnish with a large mint sprig and a preserved cherry.']",0,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/michelada/,Michelada,Liquor.com,"Beer is great. That is unassailable. But beer cocktails combine two wonderful categories into one drink, and that is a union everyone can get behind. Take the Michelada: This Mexican classic kicks up the flavor of beer with an assortment of accessories, including lime and hot sauce. The Michelada’s origins are unclear, with multiple legends surrounding its creation. But it likely dates back to the middle of the 20th century when it became popular in Mexico to serve beer with lime and salt. The word itself is a combination of “chela,” which is slang for a light beer, “helada” (cold), and “mi”—essentially “my cold beer.” Many Michelada recipes call for tomato juice or Clamato (a mixture of clam and tomato juices) to create a Bloody Mary- style drink made with beer instead of vodka. Others choose to skip the tomato juice entirely. In Mexico City, for example, the Michelada is commonly made without tomato juice and instead relies on citrus, spices and hot sauce. This recipe aligns closer to the Mexico City version, forgoing tomato in favor of lime juice, hot sauce and seasonings. You can choose your favorite beer as the starting point, but you can’t go wrong with a Mexican lager like Tecate, Sol or Modelo Especial.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/painkiller/,Painkiller,Liquor.com,"A twist on the Piña Colada , the Painkiller is a rich and fruity cocktail that stays true to its name: It will cure what ails you. Made with dark rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and cream of coconut, the drink was created in the 1970s at the Soggy Dollar Bar in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), where the confluence of warm temperatures and vacation vibes necessitated cold, refreshing libations. And where, with no dock, dollars were bound to get wet as patrons swam ashore. The Painkiller is typically made with Pusser’s Rum, a recreation of the British Royal Navy rum that was issued to sailors until 1970. Pusser’s pays homage to that rum and is made in the same style, blended on the BVI island of Tortula to the same proportions as the original. In the 1980s, the Painkiller was trademarked by Pusser’s in an enterprising feat of marketing. Sure, the Painkiller can be made with any rum if you’re making it at home, but if the Painkiller appears on menus, it should include Pusser’s. The rich blend of rums pairs with the juices and coconut cream to bring the tropics right into your glass. Dust a little fresh nutmeg on top for additional aromatics and spice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-sonic/,Gin Sonic,Ari Bendersky,"The Gin & Tonic is a two-ingredient refresher that has been quenching thirsts since around the mid-1800s. Despite its simple makeup, the drink demands your attention and can vary drastically depending on the gin, tonic and even the garnish you choose. Split that tonic with an equal measure of club soda, however, and you’ve made an entirely different drink. The Gin Sonic (soda + tonic = “sonic”) has been popular in Japan for years, but only began to find a footing in the United States in the late 2010s. Now, many bartenders around the U.S. are making the light, refreshing cocktail in their bars, helping to spread its charms to drinkers more accustomed to Vodka Tonics and G&Ts. The name suggests something big and powerful. But at its core, the Gin Sonic is a somewhat healthier version of the Gin & Tonic, made of combining gin with equal parts club soda and tonic water. It not only reduces the amount of sugar in the drink and some of quinine’s inherent bitterness but also allows for the gin's botanical flavors to pop. “Gin & Tonics can be too sweet,” says Victoria Vera, who added this version of a Gin Sonic to her menu at Tsunami Panhandle, a sake and shochu bar and restaurant in San Francisco. “When you do half soda, it balances it and brings out the flavor of the gin.” She recommends serving the drink in a highball glass because it evolved from not just the G&T but also the Whiskey Highball . “What makes it so refreshing is that extra soda water and tonic water, which a shorter rocks glass would not be able to carry.” As with a Gin & Tonic, you can change the garnish depending on what botanicals contained in the gin you’re using. With Japanese gins like Roku and Nikka Coffey, Vera likes to use a yuzu peel, while a more citrus-forward gin might require a lime or lemon. Hendrick’s gin, known for its cucumber and rose accents, works perfectly with a cucumber garnish. “The Gin Sonic allows for simple and subtle garnishes to play a supporting role in the flavor of the drink,” adds Simon Ford, the founder of Fords gin. “Just a slice of lemon, orange or grapefruit works wonders, or floating an herb like a sprig of lemon verbena adds a subtle and bright freshness.” Masahiro Urushido, the owner of New York City’s Katana Kitten , agrees with Ford. He prefers using a juniper-forward London dry style along with a fresh citrus peel or lime wedge to balance the drink’s piney notes. “Soda has the power to soften gin’s edges; it can bring out flavors that might have been too acute otherwise,”says Danny Shapiro, a partner in Chicago’s Scofflaw Group , which owns the popular gin-focused bar Scofflaw. “I’d go with higher-proof gins, above 45% ABV, for the Sonic treatment.” But it’s also how it’s made that can make or break a drink, in Urushido's opinion. He tasted his first Gin Sonic almost 20 years ago but admits it likely didn’t have a name back then. He was living in Japan and working in an upscale restaurant after high school where they had smaller bottles of higher-quality soda water and used hand-carved ice with well-selected spirits, he says. “It’s always about the right vessel and ice and those details,” says Urushido. “If you just use shitty ice, it just melts right away, so it kind of tastes like flat tonic water. In the right context, you can actually taste the difference between gin and tonic and what’s so great about the Gin Sonic.”","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin (such as Roku)'}, {'quantity': '2 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'club soda'}, {'quantity': '2 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tonic water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'yuzu twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the gin, club soda and tonic.', 'Garnish with a yuzu twist.']",137,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-and-tonic/,Gin & Tonic,Liquor.com,"Gin & Tonic. If you can say it, you can make it. Right? Right. But also, not exactly. The two-ingredient cocktail requires your undivided attention. From glassware to garnish to style of gin and spirit proof, everything should be carefully considered when mixing a G&T. A Gin & Tonic made with a potent base—45% ABV and above, if you mean business—and configured with two parts tonic to one part gin is a highball of balance and beauty. Too much gin, and the botanical spirit will overshadow the unique qualities of the tonic. Too much tonic, and it will drown the gin. There is endless room for experimentation within those two ingredients. With hundreds of gins on the market and dozens of tonics, a good G&T is a mix-and-match exercise to find the combination that best suits your tastes. London dry gins are characterized by their juniper-forward flavor profile; modern-style gins often dial down the juniper and ramp up the citrus and florals. Some tonics are dry and straightforward, with prominent notes of bitter quinine. Others are sweet and syrupy. And in between, you’ll find tonics featuring everything from citrus and aromatics to herbs and spice. Then, of course, there’s the garnish. Many people swear by a lime. Others choose a lemon, and still others prefer a grapefruit slice or rosemary sprig, or a seasonal garnish such as blood orange and thyme. All those permutations results in a bevy of Gin & Tonics, so naturally, the drink lends itself to creativity. Muddled cucumbers or fruit provide an extra dose of refreshment, and a measure of dry vermouth softens the cocktail. Liqueurs, fresh herbs and even barrel-aged gin are all fair game when you’re making G&Ts. It’s an impressive résumé for a drink that traces its roots to quinine powder, which was used in the 1840s as an antimalarial for British soldiers and citizens in India. Originally, the bitter quinine powder was mixed with soda and sugar to make it more palatable. It wasn’t long before enterprising sorts bottled the elixir for commercial use. And soon after that, tonic made its way into gin. Today, tonic features less quinine than past products, and it has a sweeter taste. But its ability to complement gin is unparalleled among mixers. Put the two together in a glass, and you can taste one of the cocktail canon’s best pairings and raise your glass to the knowledge that Gin & Tonics are, essentially, medicine. 7 Gin & Tonic Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE Liquor.com / Tim Nusog","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tonic water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheels or other seasonal garnishes you may prefer', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the gin.', 'Top with the tonic water and gently stir.', 'Garnish with lime wheels or seasonal garnishes']",373,gin
https://www.liquor.com/ancient-mariner-cocktail-recipe-6501935,Ancient Mariner,Audrey Morgan,"Whether or not a sailor’s life is for you, this spiced Tiki drink and Navy Grog riff from Jeff “Beachbum” Berry might be your new tropical favorite. Despite his nickname, Berry is no bum: The owner of New Orleans restaurant Latitude 29 has been documenting Tiki culture for more than 30 years. The story of Tiki begins much earlier: Ernest “Donn Beach” Gantt opened his Hollywood bar Don the Beachcomber in 1934, inspired by his travels in the South Pacific. Victor “Trader Vic” Bergeron followed soon after, imitating Beach’s signature style at his eponymous bar and popularizing it even more with drinks such as the Mai Tai . From that time until the dawn of the Disco era , Tiki culture was alive and well. But once the godfathers of Tiki passed away, many of their secrecy-shrouded recipes were also lost. Berry sought to preserve Tiki’s rum-soaked history by tracking down former bartenders and collecting old texts. In his first book, Beachbum Berry’s Grog Log , published in 1998, he shared many of the recipes he had gathered over the years, which are still made according to the same specs at bars around the world today. In fact, we can thank Berry for recording Donn Beach classics including the Zombie and the Pearl Diver . Over the years, Berry has also put his own spin on Tiki-canon cocktails. He created the Ancient Mariner in 1994 as a riff on Trader Vic’s version of the Navy Grog, which itself was a riff on a Donn Beach classic. Berry wanted to replicate the flavors of his favorite Trader Vic drink, but the sales pamphlet he found in his research, “Passport to Trader Vic’s Exotic Cocktails,” wasn’t of much help: It listed such vague ingredients as “Trader Vic’s Navy Grog Rum” and “Trader Vic’s Navy Grog Mix.” As Berry writes in his 2010 book, Beachbum Berry: Remixed , “We pretty much had to start from scratch.” The results are well worth the extra work. Like Donn Beach’s version of the Navy Grog, the Ancient Mariner includes an irresistible blend of rums and grapefruit and lime juices. Notably, it also calls for allspice dram, which lends aromatic baking-spice notes. Try it yourself and toast to the hard-won efforts of Berry and his team. “We called it the Ancient Mariner because by the time we finished with it, that’s how old we felt,” he writes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/navy-grog/,Navy Grog,Liquor.com,"While the original recipe for Grog, a concoction served to British naval forces in the 18th century, was rum cut with water, the Navy Grog Cocktail is an ocean away. The Big Daddy of high-octane Tiki drinks, this cocktail dates back to the early days of legendary bartender Donn Beach , a pioneer of Tiki bartending. Like many early Tiki drinks, it was served at Don the Beachcomber bars in California, and was eventually adopted by Victor Jules Bergeron, Jr., aka “Trader Vic,” the other kingpin of early Tiki culture . Much like Beach’s famous cocktail the Zombie, the Navy Grog is a boozy powerhouse with three ounces of rum, often higher-proof ones. Also like the Zombie, it’s occasionally limited to two per guest on cocktail menus. More than the volume, though, the drink demonstrates how well different styles of rum blend, with their various flavor profiles mixing to find a delicate and intoxicating balance. Jamaican rum brings earthy funk, gold demerara gives the drink a rich backbone and white rum lends it brightness and fruit notes. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Tiki drink without citrus and a flavored syrup. This particular one calls for a mix of lime juice and grapefruit juice, much like a Hemingway Daiquiri . And while some Tiki drinks call for elaborate flavored syrups, the honey syrup in the Navy Grog is a breeze to make. Given honey’s longevity, it keeps well and can also be used for drinks like the Bee’s Knees and Brown Derby. The original recipe for the Navy Grog calls for an ice-cone garnish, a rare garnish to see in a drink these days. A small cone of ice with a straw through it rests on top of the drink, so the liquid allegedly becomes extra cold as you drink through the straw. The ice cone requires a bit of planning, and probably a cone mold, not to mention freezer space. It’s easier to opt for a large pile of crushed ice like is used for a Julep or Mai Tai .

The same sentiment applies to the classic rum-spiked Mojito. So, when you combine the two in a cocktail, you get a hydrating, revitalizing drink that can thwart even the warmest of days. The classic Mojito provides a great template for experimentation that can benefit from the addition of fruits, syrups and lengtheners. The Watermelon Mojito is a clear example of the drink’s versatility. This easy riff on the classic comes from chef Chad Luethje. It stays true to its roots but features a couple clear departures from the traditional recipe. Rather than rum, lime, sugar, mint and soda water, this version takes a left turn by subbing agave nectar for simple syrup and skipping the soda water completely. However, the agave still provides that necessary kick of sweetness, and the fresh watermelon produces a lot of juice when muddled. That juice lengthens the cocktail in a similar fashion to soda, but with more flavor. So you’re left with a drink that’s arguably even more cooling and refreshing than the classic. Note that when muddling mint, you want to gently press on the leaves rather than tearing them apart.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/peppermelon/,Peppermelon,Alex Frane,"Watermelon is often slept on as a cocktail ingredient, but those who know know that summer’s most iconic melon adds a juicy freshness to drinks like the Mojito and Margarita . And while rum and tequila are both obvious matches for the juicy red fruit, gin works surprisingly well. The Peppermelon, from lauded San Francisco bar-owner H. Joseph Ehrmann, demonstrates this pairing well. The sweet watermelon, spicy pepper honey syrup and botanical gin base makes the Peppermelon an undeniably refreshing concoction, perfect year-round but especially on warm summer days. The Peppermelon is an easy drink to make, and you’re likely to have all the necessary ingredients on your home bar and in your pantry and fridge. It starts with a base of London dry gin, and Ehrmann doesn’t specify a brand. Anything you like in your Gimlet or Last Word will do. Be sure to stick with a London dry style, though, rather than an Old Tom , Holland gin or other style. For the watermelon juice, it’s best to simply squeeze an ounce with fresh watermelon, rather than wasting time finding and buying watermelon juice from the store. You can snack on the remaining watermelon while you make your drinks, making sure to reserve some cubes for the charming garnish. The only ingredient that takes some time to prep is the black pepper honey syrup that gives the drink its signature spice, as well as its name. It requires a similar process to making the honey syrup that goes into drinks like the Bee’s Knees and Brown Derby , among other honey-sweetened cocktails. You can even use the pepper honey syrup to spice up those classics, adding a unique touch. Once you’ve got your pepper honey syrup, watermelon juice, gin and lemon it’s time to get shaking. The drink is the perfect accompaniment to summer barbecues, cookouts, beach trips and any other time that you need a sweet, tart and peppery beverage. 11 Watermelon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'London dry gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'watermelon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'black pepper honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: watermelon cube', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: ground black pepper', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the London dry gin, watermelon juice, lemon juice and black pepper honey syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a watermelon cube coated on one side with ground black pepper.']",9,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whatamelon/,Whatamelon,Liquor.com,"Some cocktails are intended as contemplative affairs, drinks to be nursed thoughtfully in a moody bar. The Whatamelon, from San Francisco bar professional H. Joseph Ehrmann, is not one of those drinks. This bright red watermelon cooler is best enjoyed beach-side, on a sunny summer day. It’s playful, fun, not too complicated or serious, and most of all, it’s delicious and refreshing. The cooler starts with watermelon juice , which is easy enough to get simply by crushing up some chunks of watermelon—there’s really no reason to get fancy or buy watermelon juice. That gets muddled with mint, which releases beautiful aromatics that pair well with the watermelon. Cucumber vodka is the base spirit, which gives the drink a crisp and vegetal brightness. There are plenty of good, affordable brands out there to choose from, like Effen Cucumber, Stoli and the cucumber-mint vodka from Ketel One. Choosing a cucumber-mint vodka is reasonable, as the drink gets 6 mint leaves added, as well. If you go with one, you may want to taste it first to make sure the mint isn’t overbearing. For added sweetness and botanicals, Ehrmann adds St-Germain, an elderflower liqueur, as well as agave nectar (you could use simple syrup, instead, if need be). Lime juice keeps things fresh and bright, and to enliven it even more he suggests a float of a crisp white wine, like a sauvignon blanc or albariño.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pimms-cup/,Pimm’s Cup,Liquor.com,"The Pimm’s Cup started as a health drink in 1840s London. Take a swig, and you’ll see why—its blend of mid-proof spirit with lemon, ginger and fruit is as revitalizing as cocktails can be. And its charms are especially effective on a hot day. The slow-sipping summer cocktail is the preferred vehicle for its eponymous liqueur, Pimm’s No. 1, a gin-based digestif created in the 1800s by a London bar owner named James Pimm. The liqueur—and its associated cocktail—spread across the globe, finding a particularly loyal fan base in New Orleans. Combined with ginger ale, lemon juice, cucumber and a medley of fruit garnishes, the drink was a welcome relief from the Southern heat. The Pimm’s Cup is also the favorite cooler at Wimbledon. The first Pimm’s Bar opened in 1971 on the hallowed tennis grounds, and it’s still enjoyed today by the pitcher. The Pimm’s Cup is built right in the glass, so it’s very simple to make at home. Simply mix Pimm’s No. 1 with fresh lemon juice and ginger ale and apply your garnishes. With its refreshing taste and modest proof, its a great option for day-drinking, whether you’re watching tennis or enjoying a sunny day on your porch. To alter the core formula, you can replace the ginger ale and lemon juice with sparkling lemonade. This variation is a popular serve and one that creates an equally refreshing drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/miami-vice/,Miami Vice,Dylan Garret,"Few cocktails evoke such a sense of time and place—or earn such strong reactions—as the Miami Vice. The drink is essentially equal parts frozen Strawberry Daiquiri and Piña Colada layered on top of each other. While its origins are murky, it’s thought to have originated in its eponymous city, pre-dating the popular 1980s television series of the same name. Let’s get this out of the way: The Miami Vice is not meant to be a serious drink. In its original, intended form, it’s the cocktail equivalent of pressing two different buttons on the self-serve soda fountain at a Burger King. It’s also delicious, because Strawberry Daiquiris are delicious, and Piña Coladas are delicious. Both use flavor profiles that complement each other, so of course they taste great in a glass together. Every comment you hear saying, “Your bartender will hate you if you order this,” misses the point. The Miami Vice came about during an era that saw the proliferation of frozen drink machines, in which the original Frozen Margarita machine (which dates to Mariano’s restaurant in Dallas in 1971) had spread across the hemisphere and was used to pre-batch countless sour-style drinks that could be poured quickly on demand. Ordering a Miami Vice, at the time of its origin, was no less taxing for a bartender than pulling two handles instead of one. The slushy-machine version is still perfectly acceptable, and arguably an ideal way to enjoy this drink. However, as the decades wore on and bartenders sought to reinvent recipes of the past, new iterations of the Miami Vice that use fresh ingredients began to crop up, which also involved being blended individually to order. These are undeniably more complicated to make, as they essentially involve making two drinks rather than one, but can lead to a much tastier final result. Should I Make a Miami Vice from Scratch? If you’ve got a couple frozen drink machines and plan on making enough Miami Vices to justify batching Strawberry Daiquiris and Piña Coladas on tap, there’s little need to bother with the recipe below. However, for those that want to put in the time to make this drink at home for themselves, fresh ingredients that are blended to order can create an entirely different style of drink that offers extra flavor. Essentially, the difference between the two styles of Miami Vice is akin to ordering a fast-food burger versus one grilled at home—both can be delicious in their own way, and each has its time and place. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog Why This Recipe Works The Miami Vice works for the same reason each of its base drinks, the Strawberry Daiquiri and the Piña Colada, works. It follows the classic sour template of spirit, sweetness, and sour lime juice, but with complementary fruit flavors layered in. When it comes to flavor pairings in both the culinary and drinks world, there’s an old saying, “What grows together goes together.” This is particularly true in the world of tropical fruits, where it’s easy to mix and match produce while always finding a winning combination. Strawberry, pineapple, coconut, lime, and sugar cane-based spirits are all naturally complementary, and you can get away with a lot of tweaking by changing ratios or substituting other similar fruits to taste. If you’ve got a blender, a bit of extra time, and don’t mind putting in the work to make one of the most purely refreshing smoothie-like cocktails ever created, here’s how to create the Miami Vice yourself.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum, divided'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'strawberries, chopped'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cream of coconut'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a blender, add 1 ounce of the rum, strawberries, lime juice, simple syrup and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.', 'Pour into a hurricane glass and set in the freezer.', 'Wash and dry the blender thoroughly.', 'In the clean blender jar, add the remaining 1 ounce of rum, cream of coconut, pineapple juice and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.', 'Pour into the hurricane glass that already contains the Strawberry Daiquiri, creating a layered effect.', 'Garnish with a pineapple slice.']",230,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/macua/,El Macuá,Liquor.com,"Named for a Central American bird, this fruity, tropical cocktail became the national drink of Nicaragua in 2006 following a nationwide cocktail competition. The creator of this winning recipe, Dr. Edmundo Miranda Saenz, a native of Granada, Nicaragua, teamed up with a few family members to perfect his submission to the competition, El Trago Nacional, which was backed by iconic Nicaraguan rum producer Flor de Caña . The original El Macuá recipe calls for white rum, but if you prefer to use a rum with some age on it, this can bring a new level of complexity to the drink. And if you want to be really fancy, you could even make your own rum blend . It’s a pro move used by top-tier bars across the world. When it comes to using juice in cocktails, fresh is generally best, but some juices—like guava—are much easier to find already-juiced. Any quality guava juice will work when making El Macuá at home, though you’ll want to stick with freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices for best results. Depending on which brand of guava juice you use, the cocktail’s color will range from a bright orange-pink hue to a soft yellow shade.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whiskey-smash/,Whiskey Smash,Liquor.com,"There are dozens of great drinks in the whiskey cocktail canon, from boozy stirred classics like the Old Fashioned and Manhattan to shaken examples like the Whiskey Sour. But it’s hard to think of a drink more refreshing than the Whiskey Smash, a fruity 19th-century cousin to the Mint Julep . The Whiskey Smash made its recipe-book debut in the 1887 edition of “The Bartenders Guide” by Jerry Thomas, though variations of this fruit-and-whiskey concoction were likely made for decades prior to this inclusion. After all, bartenders and drinkers had been making juleps since the 1700s, and the citrusy Whiskey Sour was already in rotation when the Whiskey Smash came onto the scene. A good smash requires a good muddler. You want to compress the lemon wedges to release not only their juices, but also the oils in the peel, which creates a richer taste when combined with the whiskey and sugar. Adding a few fresh mint leaves to the shaker (Mr. Thomas specifically calls for spearmint) lends cooling minty notes. Legendary bartender Dale DeGroff, aka King Cocktail, began serving Whiskey Smashes at the Rainbow Room in New York when he was behind the bar during the late 1980s and 1990s, which helped to popularize and reintroduce this classic to modern drinkers. He made his version with bourbon, muddled lemon wedges and mint. Most recipes call for bourbon, but rye and even Canadian whiskies also create a fine drink. DeGroff calls the citrus-and-mint combination the perfect cocktail for those who say they’ll never drink whiskey. Serve one to whiskey lovers and novices alike—they’ll both be charmed by this tasty, easygoing cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lava-flow/,Lava Flow,Liquor.com,"The Lava Flow walks the line between cocktail and milkshake. This sweet and fruity drink is linked to Hawaii and often found at Hawaiian bars and resorts, though it’s not certain when the drink originated. No matter: If you want a delicious cocktail that conjures sandy beaches, sunny skies and floral shirts, you’ve found it. The Lava Flow is similar to a Miami Vice, which is essentially a Strawberry Daiquiri and Piña Colada combined but separated in the glass. The Lava Flow, though, skips the lime juice and adds banana, making it more like a Banana Daiquiri and Piña Colada. The drink is relatively easy to make, but it requires two steps. First, you blend the strawberries and rums, creating a red, icy mixture. Then, you blend the banana, coconut cream and pineapple juice, creating another icy mixture, this time lighter in color. Add the two chilly components to the glass from opposing sides, and watch as the red, booze-laced portion of the cocktail shoots to the top, creating the sensation of flowing lava. Now, if you ever see flowing lava in the wild, you should step back and maybe call someone. But in the case of this Lava Flow, you can dive headfirst (or straw-first) into the sweet and creamy drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coconut-colada/,Coconut Colada,Alex Frane,"Rum, coconut sorbet, pineapple juice, and lime—it’s hard to think of a more refreshing concoction to beat the summer heat. The Coconut Colada comes from bar icon Jim Meehan, cocktail book author and co-founder of New York City’s Please Don’t Tell and Portland, Oregon’s Takibi . Its roots are in the classic Piña Colada , and while it includes many of the key elements—like rum, pineapple and coconut—it differs in a few game-changing ways. Meehan made the Coconut Colada when Banks rum was released in 2010, and the use of Banks 5-Island rum as the drink’s base is purposeful and necessary for recreating it. “The Piña Colada typically relies on a subtly flavored Cuban style rum, while Banks brings much more character to this recipe, which centers around coconut instead of pineapple,” Meehan says. One difference between the Coconut Colada and a standard Piña Colada is the use of freshly squeezed pineapple juice rather than anything pre-packaged, like the ones commonly found in cans. The tartness of natural pineapple juice helps balance the sweetness of the rum and coconut, so the drink requires less lime juice to balance. “Fresh pineapple juice is floral and quite acidic, which the canned juice lacks,” Meehan explains. “Using fresh juice reduces the need for lime juice to balance the sweetness of the juice and coconut cream. I’ve always felt that lime juice was discordant in a piña colada, and you need much less of it if you use fresh pineapple juice.” The other major difference, perhaps the most dramatic change to the recipe, is the use of coconut sorbet, or sorbetto, rather than the usual canned cream of coconut, which Meehan admits he’s not the biggest fan of. “A coconut sorbet from a producer that uses the real thing—such as Ciao Bella or Häagen-Dazs—is a game changer for this recipe from a taste and texture standpoint.” The lighter sweetness of it also helps cut down on the lime juice. For the garnish, the Coconut Colada gets dried coconut flakes, which Meehan says “are a little cheesy” but that he “stands by them.” Piña Colada 535 ratings","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Banks 5-Island rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'scoop', 'ingredient': 'coconut sorbetto, such as Ciao Bella or Häagen-Dazs'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: dried coconut flakes', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Banks 5-Island rum, pineapple juice, lime juice and coconut sorbet to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled rocks or coupe glass or a coconut shell.', 'Garnish with dried coconut flakes.']",8,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cinnamon-french-toast/,Cinnamon French Toast,Liquor.com,"Just when you thought you were about to dive into an article about a cinnamon French toast cocktail, here we are with a somewhat elaborate recipe for actual French toast—made with rum. In fact, after trying this edible brunch cocktail of sorts, you’ll never look at French toast the same way again thanks to San Francisco chef Nigel Jones, who originally created the recipe for his now-closed restaurant Kaya. 11 Rum Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE Cooking with rum is an art form every culinary buff and spirits enthusiast should add to their arsenal. “I love cooking with rum because there’s so much flavor to it ... and each style can be used in a specific way,” says Jones. “When you’re working with hearty proteins like short ribs or beef that you plan on stewing for a long time, you can treat rum just like you would wine. The rum melds with the juices of the meat to develop incredible flavor.” According to Jones, who also has been known to serve an overproof rum-based ginger-butter sauce over salmon, cooking with rum is not unlike using it in cocktails, in terms of flavor affinities. Use white rums for a backbone of alcohol, spiced rums for blank canvases that require a hit of baking spice (such as vanilla-flavored cakes), and aged rums for anything that could benefit from subtle caramel notes (or not-so-subtle, depending on how much you use). If you’re looking for a great cocktail to pair with your boozy French toast, you’ll definitely want to opt for something light and refreshing given the sweet, indulgent nature of the dish. From a classic Daiquiri to a good old Mai Tai or a great Rum Punch , the pairing options are rather endless.

Margaritas can be transcendent when made properly but, when ordering one in the wild, you have a greater risk of getting a pint-sized glass filled with day-glow sour mix and an imbalanced drink. When you're looking for a refreshing cocktail that will hit all the right notes in less than two shakes, the Paloma's three-ingredient highball built directly in the glass is a sure thing. Mezcal Paloma 16 ratings How to Make a Perfectly Balanced Paloma Palomas are effortless but also offer a surprisingly complex flavor profile. The simple 3-ingredient formula also contains more variables for differentiation than one might think. Blanco tequila is the traditional choice, but lightly aged reposado also makes a fine drink. It’s best to keep the añejo capped for this cocktail, as the well-aged expression’s oaky profile disrupts that clean, refreshing taste you want in a Paloma. In Mexico, Jarritos is commonly the grapefruit soda of choice for its easy accessibility, high carbonation, and sugar cane-sweetened grapefruit flavor. This brand is relatively easy to find stateside, particularly in grocery stores that stock Mexican foods and ingredients. The slightly tarter Squirt is another common pick in Mexico and is a bartender favorite. Some people may choose to rim the glass with salt, while others add a pinch of salt straight into the drink. This step isn’t necessary, but it does add a savory quality that melds beautifully with the earthy tequila and tart grapefruit. And it opens the possibility of using a spiced salt, like Tajín, for an extra seasoning kick. Because the Paloma is constructed right in the glass, you don’t need any bar tools to make it. Just add your ingredients to a highball glass with ice, give a quick stir, and you’re ready to enjoy a refreshing cocktail. Mexico’s national cocktail is a great choice any day of the year.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/el-diablo/,El Diablo,Liquor.com,"When most people think of classic tequila drinks, their mind probably goes to the Margarita first, maybe the Paloma second. They may never get to the El Diablo, but they should. This mid-century classic combines tequila with crème de cassis (a sweet blackcurrant liqueur), lime juice and ginger. The recipe first appeared in print as the Mexican El Diablo in Trader Vic’s Book of Food and Drink , which was published in 1946 and lists Vic as the drink’s creator (later recipes shortened the name to El Diablo, as it’s been known since). That first recipe called for ginger ale, and you can still opt for the gingery soda if you like. But ginger ale during this time period was spicier than most options available today, the former version having more in common with ginger beer. This recipe uses ginger beer to best recreate the cocktail’s traditional flavor. 11 Tequila and Mezcal Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE The El Diablo offers another important choice beyond the bubbly topper. You can add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice and strain the contents into a glass, which supplies a gorgeous reddish-purple cocktail. Or you can build the drink in your glass, starting with the tequila and lime followed by the ginger beer, and then adding a float of cassis on top as the finishing touch. This construction creates a visually stunning cocktail with a richly colored halo on top before the liqueur slowly leaks toward the bottom of the glass. Both methods produce a delicious drink that finds balance between earthy tequila, fresh citrus, sweet and fruity liqueur and spicy ginger. Today, it’s also common to find El Diablos made with fresh ginger syrup . In this case, the cocktail is usually topped with sparkling water rather than ginger beer to prevent a ginger overload. You’ve got options, and all of them yield positive results, so do what feels right to make this drink your own.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'reposado tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de cassis'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'Garnish:', 'ingredient': 'lime wedge'}]","['Add the tequila, creme de cassis and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice and top with the ginger beer.', 'Garnish with a lime wedge.']",88,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mezcal-mule/,Mezcal Mule,Liquor.com,"The Moscow Mule is one of the most popular cocktails in the world. Even those who typically don’t order mixed drinks have likely had one. But as with many classic cocktails, the standard blend of vodka, ginger beer and lime is ripe for experimentation, and over the years the original has spawned countless variations. The Mezcal Mule, as created by acclaimed bartender Jim Meehan, is hardly the first drink to try and reinvent this template, but it is one of the most successful. It’s unclear when the first mezcal-based mule was served. Many bartenders had begun to swap around spirits in the classic Moscow Mule around the turn of the 21st century. Audrey Saunders created the Gin-Gin Mule at her New York bar Pegu Club, which was meant to act as a crossover drink intended to turn vodka drinkers on to gin. The Kentucky Mule subs bourbon for vodka, appealing to fans of brown spirits. But Meehan's Mezcal Mule takes the drink beyond it's original three-part template. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog First created by Meehan at PDT, the famed New York bar, this recipe includes a few flourishes. Mezcal, ginger beer and lime lead the way, as you’d expect. From there, Meehan calls on passion fruit purée to incorporate tart, tropical sweetness, and muddled cucumber for a fresh, aromatic accent. Cucumber and candied ginger are used for garnish (and potential snacks), while a dusting of chile powder adds a kick to each sip and helps to accentuate both the burn of the ginger and the alcohol. The Mezcal Mule colors outside the classic vodka-based mule’s lines but still offers plenty of familiar flavors for fans of the original.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cucumber slices'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Sombra mezcal'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Boiron passion fruit puree'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cucumber slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'candied ginger', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'chile powder', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the cucumber slices and agave nectar to a shaker and muddle.', 'Add the mezcal, lime juice and passion fruit puree to the shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the ginger beer.', 'Garnish with a cucumber slice and a piece of candied ginger, and top with a pinch of chile powder.']",52,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pineapple-jalapeno-margarita/,Pineapple Jalapeño Margarita,Liquor.com,"There are nearly as many Margarita variations as people to make them. The classic recipe, composed simply of tequila, orange liqueur and fresh lime juice, has inspired countless takes over the decades and helped to cement the Margarita as one of the most popular drinks in the world. One of cocktail’s main selling points is that its ingredients are versatile and can be combined with numerous additions, from tropical fruits to spicy peppers. Blogger and recipe developer Matt Armato employs both in his aptly named Pineapple Jalapeño Margarita. The fruit and pepper are muddled in the shaker to release their juices (you can control the jalapeño’s spice by choosing whether to remove the seeds before muddling) and then shaken with reposado tequila, triple sec, lime juice and more pineapple juice. Reposado tequila, used in place of the usual blanco expression, lends notes of sweet oak and spice to the drink, producing a slightly richer Margarita than the classic. In another fun addition, the resulting cocktail is served in a glass that’s been rimmed with a sugar-black pepper mixture to provide a sweet and savory kick with each sip.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spiced-margarita/,Spiced Margarita,Liquor.com,"As Italian liqueurs go, amaretto might be the most misunderstood . When joined with commercial sour mix, it becomes the backbone to a two-ingredient sugar bomb with a hangover to match. While the original recipe was flavored with bitter almonds, those were abandoned when producers realized they were potentially chock-full of deadly cyanide. Modern versions instead use regular almonds or apricot or peach stones to capture that distinctive flavor. But how can amaretto’s stereotype as cloyingly sweet be flipped? And what to do with that bottle in the far reaches of the liquor collection? The Spiced Margarita from Joan Villanueva, the beverage curator at BO-beau kitchen + caché in San Diego, is one such answer. In this Margarita variation, amaretto stands in for the sweetness normally provided by orange liqueur or simple syrup, and muddled jalapeño slices lend a touch of lip-tingling heat. “Spicy and bold flavors work really well with amaretto,” Villanueva says. “I sometimes hear how people drank too much amaretto a long time ago, so I like to offer the option to reconnect with an old friend.” Though the recipe calls for a blanco tequila as its base, Vllanueva says that mezcal drinks with a chile-heat component are her go-to inspirations for incorporating amaretto. Substituting the tequila with mezcal is a popular approach to making Margaritas in general, and it definitely works here, with the smoky, earthy spirit blending with the rich sweetness of amaretto and fiery kick of peppers. If you’re opting for the original recipe with blanco tequila, though, you’ve got many, many options.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spicy-mint-avocado-margarita/,Spicy Mint Avocado Margarita,Liquor.com,"Most people can recite the reported health benefits of the mighty avocado—loaded with nutrients, antioxidants and plenty of that supposedly beneficial kind of fat. An essential part of many Mexican and other Latin American dishes, and a beloved topping for toast at hip cafés worldwide, the noble berry is beloved for its silky texture and gorgeous green hue. Despite its popularity in cooking, the avocado is rarely approached as an ingredient for use in bartending. But it is a fruit (a berry, even), and fruits have always had a role behind the bar. Margaritas , especially, love getting some extra fruitiness, and while unconventional and possibly unorthodox, that can even include avocado. This Margarita spin doubles down on the green, muddling the “super fruit” with fresh mint and jalapeño. The richness of the avocado helps muffle the heat from the jalapeños, though there will still be plenty of spice. This is especially true if you don’t seed the jalapeños first, which can lead to an overly hot cocktail. When seeding and slicing the peppers it’s wise to wear some kind of latex or rubber gloves, or at least be sure to wash up afterwards; no one wants jalapeño oils in their eyes. While the recipe calls for any kind of orange liqueur for the drink, traditionally you’ll want to reach for a bottle of triple sec. The most well-regarded for use in Margaritas tends to be Cointreau , and many bartenders at cocktail bars across the world use it in theirs. However, there are alternatives , including Combier L'Original Liqueur d'Orange. Like its name implies, it’s considered the first triple sec ever made. Of course, the most important ingredient in any Margarita, even one with mint, peppers and avocado, is the tequila. The Spicy Mint Avocado Margarita is best with a blanco tequila. These unaged (or shortly aged) tequilas are bright, vivid and vegetal, often with grassy and citrus notes that complement the other ingredients. Using a darker, more robust tequila can muddy the flavors. Since there is so much going on in the drink, don’t feel obligated to go top-shelf with your selection. But because the flavor will still be present, don’t be tempted to go bottom-shelf, either. There are numerous affordable and serviceable options for blanco tequila these days.

This Tequila Limeade, from blogger and recipe developer Matt Armato , is an easy to make cocktail that adds serious kick to your summertime parties or afternoon porch hangs. The Tequila Limeade is, essentially, an effervescent take on a Spicy Margarita . It starts a bit differently though, by muddling together fresh jalapeños, agave nectar, and cilantro.

Its proven combination of tequila, fresh lime juice and orange liqueur has been sating thirsts since the middle of the 20th century. So, it’s only natural that one may wish to perform the noble task of making a bunch of Margaritas at once. Because as common wisdom dictates, Margaritas by the Pitcher are a surefire way to please a crowd. Making a pitcher of Margaritas is not more difficult than making a single Margarita. The chief difference is that you will use a larger quantity of each ingredient. Once your pitcher is full, you can dole out glasses to your guests, which saves you time and keeps them happy. This recipe comes from bartending legend Dale DeGroff. He adds agave syrup to the holy trinity of tequila, lime juice and Cointreau for a dash of sweetness and scales up the ratios into a large batch that fits snugly into a 52-ounce pitcher. This recipe serves 12 people, but you can tweak the portions as needed and employ a larger pitcher to accommodate more drinks. (Hey, the people like refills.)

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/salty-ginger-ade/,Salty Ginger-Ade,Kaitlyn Goalen,"There’s a longstanding tradition in Southeast Asia of spiking citrusy drinks with salt as a way to battle intense heat and provide the body with electrolytes. In India, the beverage jaljeera has a similar strategy, but with the addition of cumin (jeera translates to cumin in Hindi). The base of the drink is usually a spice mix of cumin, black salt, ginger, mint and fruit powder such as amchoor, and it sometimes includes muddled dates or tamarind. The Salty Ginger-Ade takes its cues from jaljeera. To create this inspired mocktail, first grab some Medjool dates. The remaining ingredients you’re likely to already have in the pantry. You’ll begin by muddling a date to bring out the fruit’s rich sweetness. The addition of fresh lime adds tartness and balance, while the salt and cumin commingle to create a distinct, almost shrublike effect. Lastly, ginger beer provides a sweet and spicy kick, turning the cocktail into a tall refreshment that’s perfect for sipping when temperatures rise. Because the Salty Ginger-Ade contains no alcohol, it can be consumed all day long when you want a break from the hard stuff, or by those who choose to abstain from alcohol.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hemingway-daiquiri/,Hemingway Daiquiri,Wayne Curtis,"Ernest Hemingway needed a bathroom. Or so the story goes. The novelist had stopped into Havana’s El Floridita bar, not far from the hotel where he lived during much of the 1930s. On his way out, he noticed the bartender setting up Daiquiris. Never one to walk past a drink, Hemingway took a sip. Not bad, he said, but he preferred them with no sugar and double the rum. The bartender made one as specified, and then named the drink after him. A bar. A man. A drink. “Those are the facts,” writes drink historian Ted Haigh in “ Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails ,” “and from there the story goes straight to hell.” The bartender may have called this drink the Papa Doble, which, with some ingredient additions, morphed into the Hemingway Daiquiri (or possibly the Hemingway Special or El Floridita #4). The exact history is a matter of considerable contention among cocktail sleuths, who have been poring over the clues ever since Hemingway walked out of the bathroom. But of course, there’s what really matters: Is this a good drink? Turns out, trusting Hemingway on cocktail quality is like trusting an NFL linebacker on how to make pasta. His concern was more about quantity than quality—Hemingway proudly claimed the El Floridita house record of 16 double Daiquiris. Of course he didn’t want sugar in his Daiquiri; those 16 drinks, if traditionally made, would have involved nearly two cups of sugar. If the alcohol didn’t kill him, the sugar certainly would. Hemingway’s sugarless Daiquiri never really caught on the way the Dry Martini did. Try one: You’ll find it surprising that something can be so bland and so undrinkably tart at the same time. But it evolved over the years into something much better. Argue all you want about the composition and history of a true Hemingway Daiquiri; I just figure it’s a traditional Daiquiri with a Bohemian streak—the sugar reduced at one point and grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur added at another point to give a bit of depth and sweetness.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/turf-club/,Turf Club,Liquor.com,"Although the origins of the Martini are largely unknown, historians have pointed to the Turf Club as one of the earlier cocktails to combine gin and vermouth. The first printed recipe, published in 1884 in George Winter’s How to Mix Drinks , consisted of Old Tom gin, sweet vermouth, and bitters, which made it similar to the Martinez . At the turn of the century, the barkeep Harry Johnson published a recipe that hews more closely to a modern-day Turf Club in the second edition of his Bartenders ’ Manual. Simply called the Turf Cocktail, it included equal parts Plymouth gin and dry vermouth, along with absinthe, maraschino liqueur, and orange bitters. Today, as with many Martini variations, the Turf Club has evolved into a slightly drier cocktail with a higher ratio of gin to vermouth. Although some versions still call for Plymouth gin, it can also be made with a crisper, more juniper-forward London Dry. The Turf Club’s flavor profile is typically sharper and more dry than its similar-on-paper sibling, the Tuxedo No. 2 . As originally published in Johnson’s book, the two drinks were close to identical; in their resurrected modern incarnations, the two have developed in slightly different ways. The Tuxedo No. 2 is generally rounder and slightly sweeter, particularly when made with Plymouth gin and blanc vermouth, although recipes and bar specifications may vary. In both cocktails, maraschino liqueur contributes subtle notes of marasca cherries and almonds, while dashes of absinthe and orange bitters add sharpness.

Wander the streets of Milan during the spring or summer and you’re bound to spots dozens of goblets holding this red-orange bubbly concoction, and that trend has fully arrived in most American cities. But with just a tweak to one ingredient, and you have a similarly refreshing and pleasing afternoon tipple that evokes the flavors of the Pacific Northwest: the Ranye West. Beyond a play on the name of the famously controversial rapper, the Ranye West is named for the nickname given to one the Northwest’s most popular cheap brews: Rainier Beer . Named for the majestic mountain in the Washington part of the Cascade Range, Rainier beers go by many names in the Pacific Northwest, including Vitamin R and Ranye, a playful faux-French pronunciation of the name, which is actually like Rain-Ear. Like the prosecco normally called for in an Aperol Spritz, Rainier is light, bubbly, crisp and golden. Of course it’s also around $1 a can, unlike most prosecco. A staple of dive bars, often served with a shot of whiskey or tequila for industry workers after their shifts, Rainier has become a symbol of Pacific Northwest working class. But it’s also found a place in Shandies and other beer-based drinks due to its popularity. The Ranye West, from Seattle bartender Jeff Steiner, is one such drink, with Rainier replacing the wine and club soda in the spritz. A generous splash of lemon juice adds back in some of the acidity that gets lost when not using wine, and a few dashes of Angostura bitters brings some depth and complexity to the drink. Of course, it’s perfectly acceptable to use another domestic canned lager of your choosing. It can’t technically be a Ranye West, as it lacks the beer the gives it the name, but it can still be a delicious and affordable alternative to the standard Aperol Spritz.

This dry, herbaceous varietal is generally regarded for its vivaciousness and, depending on the grape’s climate and ripeness, its wide scope of fruit notes from ultra-tart citrus to bright, tropical fruits like pineapple and passion fruit. The brainchild of Alex Day, one of the masterminds behind legendary cocktail bar Death & Co , this punch is a game-changer, especially for those who love to host. Scaling up a bona fide cocktail worthy of being served at one of the world’s best bars is much less complicated than it sounds. “Above all else, white wine cocktails are light and refreshing, [and] are amazingly easy to batch whether for two or a party,” says Jake Pippin of Casillero del Diablo , a Chilean wine producer. “Wine cocktails are much lower in alcohol than spirit-based drinks but are still incredibly complex, light and bright or rich and creamy with nuances and layers of evolving flavors.” Sauvignon blanc's flavor profile can vary, and you’ll want to select your wine based on the flavors of your cocktail’s other ingredients. In this case, you’ll be using citrus juices and bittersweet, citrusy Aperol , which pairs best with a more fresh and zesty sauvignon blanc, Pippin notes. So fill up your fancy ice trays and consider investing in a vintage punch bowl set, because this punch is about to become your new go-to party trick.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sauvignon blanc'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'aperol'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}]","['Add all ingredients except the club soda into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with the club soda and stir briefly and gently to combine.']",17,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/scarlet-spritz/,Scarlet Spritz,Liquor.com,"The Spritz is a perfect summer cocktail. It’s light, refreshing and relatively low-ABV, and because the Spritz is more a template than a specific recipe, it offers endless room for experimentation. The Aperol Spritz , with Aperol (a bittersweet Italian liqueur), prosecco and club soda, is the most famous of the category, but bartenders continue to riff on this classic in exciting ways. Take the Scarlet Spritz. It’s an original drink by Brandon Lockman, the head bartender at Red Star Tavern in Portland, Oregon. He sticks with Aperol but infuses it with fresh strawberries for a fruity kick. He pairs it with Lillet Blanc, the French wine-based aperitif, plus rhubarb bitters, which complement the rhubarb flavors present in Aperol. That’s all served in an absinthe-rinsed Nick & Nora glass for a hint of herbal, anise-y aromatics, then topped with sparkling wine . The finished product is light, bubbly and exactly what you want when the weather turns warm. There is one downside to drinking a Spritz: getting to the bottom of your glass. Lockman meets this challenge by serving any remaining liquid from prepping the drink in a tiny carafe nestled in ice, so you can refill your glass as it’s depleted. Depending on the size of your glass, you may not require this fun bonus. But it’s a visually pleasing addition to the cocktail, so you might consider doubling the recipe to ensure you have a little extra to go around. When that first one goes down quickly, you’ll be glad to have reinforcements.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dub-treo/,Dub Treo,Liquor.com,"It’s come to a point that the Negroni , that crimson-hued Italian classic, is essentially a category of cocktails as much as its own drink. While many purists might reject that premise, the fact is that it provides a useful template that has led to countless variations . The Dub Treo is one such version, which uses the base recipe of gin, sweet vermouth and Campari and tweaks the individual ingredients as well as their proportions. The key to the cocktail is rum. A Rum Negroni is no strange creation at this point, and the drink is especially delicious when made with a Jamaican rum like Appleton Estate. This high quality, affordable aged rum works well as a cocktail base because of its rich, assertive characteristics and its relative dryness. It’s also easy to find in most markets. It will make an excellent Daiquiri or Rum Old Fashioned , so it’s worth getting a bottle for the Dub Treo, even if you only make a few. When it comes to the sweet vermouth, there’s a wide world of options, but the Dub Treo specifically calls for Carpano Antica Formula. This lush, botanical vermouth was first crafted in 1786 and was, reportedly, the first sweet vermouth ever made. It was also wildly popular in the early days of the so-called Cocktail Renaissance of the late 2000s, before the category was flooded with all kinds of vermouth, from old, rediscovered recipes to new styles. Today, Carpano is still widely available and well-regarded for its botanicals and it’s a hard ingredient to substitute. The largest deviation in the drink from the Negroni is using Aperol rather than Campari . Though they’re both bittersweet Italian amari (and are both owned by Campari Company), Aperol is lighter, more citrus-forward and a bit sweeter with notes of gentian and bitter orange. Its most famous application, and something you can play with once you’ve had your fill of the Dub Treo, is the Aperol Spritz. Finally, unlike the one-to-one-to-one ratio of a Negroni, this drink is two parts rum and one part each sweet vermouth and Aperol. Plus, for some extra botanicals and some dark notes it gets a dash of whiskey barrel-aged bitters. If needed, you can swap that for Angostura bitters. Love the Negroni? Try These 9 Variations.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/el-chapo/,El Chapo,Liquor.com,"El Chapo is a three-ingredient recipe from Nashville bartender Ben Clemons. It packs a lot of flavor and components into those three parts, beginning with Fords gin , a classic London dry gin that provides a solid backbone. But then things start to get interesting. Aperol is a cocktail workhorse that can lead the charge in drinks like the Aperol Spritz or sit back and play second fiddle, letting its bittersweet notes complement other ingredients. In the El Chapo, Clemons freshens the Aperol further by infusing a bottle with fresh strawberries. The easy infusion takes a little work ahead of time, but it’s worth the effort. You’re only using one ounce of the infusion in this cocktail, so you’ll have an entire bottle of strawberry Aperol at your disposal—to make 24 more El Chapos or to experiment with other recipes. Next up is Stiegl-Radler, a grapefruit beer. A radler is a drink category that’s similar to a shandy , and combines beer with juice, lemonade or citrus soda. Typically low in alcohol, these light and refreshing drinks were popularized in Europe during the early 20th century and can still be found today in cans, in bottles and on draft. Put everything together, and you get dry, botanical gin plus two fruit-forward accompaniments that provide ultimate refreshment. Throw in the gorgeous red hue, and the El Chapo is a cocktail you’ll want to make all year long—or at least as long as strawberries are in season. 5 Strawberry Cocktails to Try for Summer RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Fords gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'strawberry-infused Aperol'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Stiegl-Radler grapefruit beer'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry slices'}]","['Fill a rocks glass with ice, then add the gin and strawberry-infused Aperol.', 'Top with the beer.', 'Garnish with two fresh strawberry slices speared on a cocktail pick.']",20,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/precision-timepiece/,Precision Timepiece,Kevin Gray,"Sother Teague is known for working his magic with bitters, vermouth and all manner of amari. That’s what he does as the beverage director at Amor y Amargo , the acclaimed New York bar. There, the bartenders follow a strict ethos: They don’t use juices, syrups or shakers, opting to solely make stirred cocktails where the spirits are always the star. It requires a deft touch to create drinks that are balanced and nuanced, but Teague and company have mastered their practice. And you can see that craft in action with the Precision Timepiece cocktail, which features Jägermeister, Amaro Montenegro, Aperol and pimento bitters. Jägermeister has come a long way from its reputation as a college shot or something to be dropped into Red Bull. The dark, German liqueur is bittersweet and intensely herbal, with notes of licorice, clove and ginger. Those flavors, plus its rich mouthfeel, work well in a variety of cocktails. In the Precision Timepiece, Aperol cuts through some of Jäger’s bitter and herbal notes, brightening things with orange and grapefruit. Amaro Montenegro, with its 40 proprietary botanicals, brings more citrusy orange character to the party, plus flavors of caramel, cola and honey, which lend extra body and sweetness. And finally, a couple dashes of pimento bitters are employed for additional spice and complexity. Teague’s cocktail is a reminder that bitter is a relative term, and amari and herbal liqueurs can be harnessed to make drinks that taste a lot friendlier than their individual components might suggest—no simple syrup required. 3 Jägermeister Cocktails That Will Change Your Life RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Jägermeister'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Amaro Montenegro'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients to a mixing glass and fill with ice.', 'Stir until well-chilled, and strain into a rocks glass over one large cube.', 'Garnish with an orange twist.']",13,

Marissa Huff, the author of “ Aperitivo: The Cocktail Culture of Italy ,” says that, in Italy, aperitivo culture has become woven into the country’s social fabric. It’s an excuse to meet friends before a meal as well as a time to wind down in the early evening and relax with a refreshing drink after work. In recent years, U.S. drinkers have embraced this culture so much that it’s no longer restricted to the early evening pre-dinner hours. “Aperitivo hour has blurred into entire evenings spent sipping and snacking,” says Huff. The Aperol Spritz is a classic example of a cocktail that makes regular appearances during such occasions. But if you want to step outside the classic box, New York City’s award-winning bar Dante has your inspiration. Aperitivo #1 is a floral elixir that balances bitterness and citrus. It features bittersweet Aperol with flowery Lillet and bianco vermouth. Passionfruit supplies tartness, while a splash of tequila enhances the drink’s vegetal notes and increases its proof. Mango vinegar and orange flower water contribute unexpected flavors, a pinch of salt harmonizes everything, and sparkling water lends refreshing bubbles. Yes, there’s a lot going on in this drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-st-germain-cocktail/,St-Germain Cocktail,Dylan Garret,"Before the Hugo Spritz took over in popular culture as the world's elderflower liqueur-based spritz of choice, the St-Germain Cocktail held that title. Late spirits pioneer Rob Cooper invented St-Germain in 2007 and the French elderflower-based liqueur quickly become a staple in craft cocktail bars around the world. This simple to make spritz helped to get it there. St-Germain is made with fresh elderflowers that are hand-picked once a year in the late spring, with each bottle containing up to 1,000 of the little blossoms. The St-Germain Cocktail (sometimes called the St-Germain Spritz or Elderflower Spritz) was created by spirits expert Simon Difford to coincide with the launch of the product. Difford's recipe featured Sauvignon Blanc, while today it’s more common to use sparkling wine for a double dose of bubbles. Fresh and delicate, St-Germain combines well with both ingredients, and either combination yields the perfect aperitif for a breezy summer evening. Why the Original St-Germain Cocktail Still Works The St-Germain Cocktail employs a similar strategy as the Aperol Spritz . Both pair a low-ABV liqueur with sparkling wine and club soda for ultimate refreshment. But the Aperol Spritz chooses Italian-made Prosecco, while the St-Germain Cocktail often features Champagne for an extra French flair. The elderflower lends a floral sweetness to the dry, bubbly wine, while the club soda balances that sweetness with a dose of dilution and more effervescence. Hugo Spritz RELATED ARTICLE Born during the craft cocktail revival, St-Germain’s fast success spawned other elderflower liqueurs, so these days you have options. But while any of these products can make a good drink, you can’t make a true St-Germain Cocktail without St-Germain. Once you have your ingredients, the drink is very easy to assemble. You simply build it in the glass, no stirring or shaking required.

https://www.liquor.com/channel-orange-cocktail-recipe-5074500,Channel Orange,Liquor.com,"Created by Jen Rae, the bar manager at the fabulous amaro-focused Seattle bar Barnacle , the Channel Orange was inspired by that most classic of aperitivi, the Spritz . The Spritz was popularized in Italian and Austrian cafes before making its way stateside, and, these days, the most ubiquitous of the Spritz family in the States is the Aperol Spritz . The Channel Orange follows the same recipe template—bitter liqueur, prosecco, club soda, citrus garnish—but enhances it by calling for three different bitter liqueurs rarely seen behind the bar, as well as grapefruit soda to make those citrus notes pop. The end result yields a nuanced, bright and citrusy drink. Rae uses Negroni Aperitivo Sixteen for the largest portion of the trinity of bittersweet liqueurs. Inspired by the drink of the the same name , this bittersweet liqueur shares a similar hue to Campari, but has more notes of orange, gentian and rhubarb. Next is Amara, an amaro d’arancia rossa , or blood orange liqueur. Made in Sicily, it’s somewhere between a traditional amaro and a fruit liqueur. And, rather than using a plain club soda, Rae opts for a grapefruit soda, particularly one from Q Mixers , though other brands could work (just maybe stay away from the Squirt for this one). “For the spritz, I really wanted to accentuate citrus flavors without the use of actual citrus juice, as Barnacle doesn’t have juice,” she says. “The Negroni Aperitivo and Amara Rosa are packed with citrus flavors, and the Q Grapefruit soda brings the brightness.” The third liqueur used in the Channel Orange is one that’s difficult to replace or substitute: Granada-Vallet pomegranate liqueur . A Mexican bittersweet liqueur inspired by the Italian style, it’s made with pomegranate as well as cinnamon, fennel, gentian root, wormwood, cinchona bark, orange, makrut lime and Oaxacan cochineal. The cocktail is then is topped with the Q soda and some prosecco, as is traditional with any spritz. A cava would work as well, though most Champagnes are going to be a bit too bready and rich for a spritz. Like at Barnacle, it’s best when paired with fresh seafood, especially some briny raw oysters from the Pacific Ocean.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/champagne-cobbler/,Champagne Cobbler,Liquor.com,"There are those who believe champagne should be left unadulterated—the bubbly wine from the northeast of France is often considered the best wine in the world, or at least the most celebratory, after all. But it’s also the most popular wine to use as the base of mixed drinks, so much so that it has its own signature drinks, like the Champagne Cocktail and Mimosa . The Champagne Cobbler, from Ashford Castle in Ireland, is similar in its simplicity to these two, including only champagne and a few flavoring elements. It combines fresh orange juice like a Mimosa but adds pineapple juice, and includes a sweetener like in a Champagne Cocktail, but uses maraschino liqueur rather than simple syrup. With any champagne-based drink, you’re going to want to pick a bottle that’s not too expensive. Champagne is almost always of good quality, so even going for something on the “cheaper” end of the spectrum will yield a wine that will work in the Champagne Cobbler. And unless you’re making a large batch of these, you’ll want to pick something you enjoy drinking on its own, so you can finish off the remainder of the wine before it goes flat. When adding the fruit juices, it’s always preferable to use something freshly squeezed rather than out of a carton. It’s especially true when you’re going to be mixing it into champagne, so with the Champagne Cobbler be sure to use fresh orange juice and, if possible, freshly squeezed pineapple juice. Fresh squeezed pineapple juice tends to be less sweet and more floral than the canned versions, which is important as the drink also calls for a measure of maraschino liqueur for sweetness. Luxardo is far and away the most popular brand of maraschino liqueur, but others like Maraska and Leopold Bros make excellent versions, too. Like most champagne drinks, the appeal of the Champagne Cobbler is that it can be enjoyed at anytime of day, whether it replaces your normal Mimosa at brunch, stands in for an Aperol Spritz at happy hour or caps off a dinner party as a companion to dessert.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/jungle-bird/,Jungle Bird,Kevin Gray,"The Jungle Bird cocktail dates back to the 1970s, when it was served as a welcome drink to visitors of the former Kuala Lumpur Hilton, which opened in 1973. The cocktail was crafted by Jeffrey Ong inside the hotel’s Aviary Bar, hence the drink’s name, and the Jungle Bird is said to have been served inside a porcelain bird-shaped vessel. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog The Jungle Bird made its recipe-book debut in 1989, when it appeared in “The New American Bartender’s Guide” by John J. Poister. It was later cataloged in Jeff “Beachbum” Berry’s book “Intoxica,” first published in 2002. Despite the drink’s popularity in Malaysia and its recipe having been recorded for posterity, the drink took a few decades to gain traction outside its home country. But today, the Jungle Bird is a fixture on Tiki bar menus and cocktail bar menus, and it has even inspired the names of bars in multiple cities, including New York and Sacramento. The first written recipe for the Jungle Bird called for generic dark rum. Berry updated the recipe to feature Jamaican rum , while many bartenders choose to use blackstrap rum for its richness. Other modern updates include scaling down the pineapple juice from its original four ounces to a more manageable amount, changing the cocktail from a tall, quaffable cooler to a complex sipper. Once you’ve settled on your rum, you’ll want to secure your juices. Fresh lime juice is a must, and if you’ve got a juicer or muddler, fresh pineapple juice keeps the refreshing theme going. Campari, which pairs well with the rum and fruit, adds a rich vein of herbal bitterness to the cocktail. All that’s left is the sugar. This recipe calls for demerara syrup, an equal-parts combination of raw cane sugar and water that adds depth to many Tiki-style drinks. Shake everything together, and transport yourself back to 1970s Malaysia.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/white-negroni/,White Negroni,Liquor.com,"The three-part Negroni is a classic cocktail dating back to the early 20th century, when it was supposedly invented by the Italian Count Camillo Negroni in Florence, Italy. It’s come a long way since then. Today, the Negroni transcends time and place, having become a ubiquitous fixture at bars and in drinkers’ hearts. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be tweaked. Creative barkeeps have been making the Negroni their own for years, experimenting with various spirits and modifiers and tweaking the typical equal-parts ratio. One such riff was so successful that it has taken on a life of its own. The White Negroni was invented in 2001 by British bartender Wayne Collins at VinExpo, a beverage trade show in Bordeaux, France. He wanted to create a Negroni riff that featured gin but not Campari or sweet vermouth. To replace those two stalwarts, he reached for a couple of French ingredients: Suze, a bittersweet gentian liqueur and Lillet Blanc, a wine-based aperitif. The former plays the role of bittering agent, similar to Campari, while the latter does the work of the vermouth. Collins’ cocktail was a hit. Bartenders took note, and the White Negroni made its way to bars around the globe, perhaps most notably to Pegu Club in New York, where it earned a spot on the bar’s menu. This placement was a gold star for street cred and helped introduce the cocktail to countless drinkers. The White Negroni then made its way to other notable bars, including PDT, the acclaimed speakeasy, and Dante, which pours an entire roster of Negronis. Originally mixed with equal parts of each ingredient, just like the classic Negroni, the common recipe today ups the gin and dials back the Suze. The result is a drink that is bitter and bracing, just like you want your Negroni to be. But it’s also light and floral, with a hint of sweetness. 9 Negroni Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lillet blanc'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Suze gentian liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Lillet blanc and Suze into a mixing glass with ice and stir for 15 to 20 seconds until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",65,gin

The Americano is thought to be the Negroni’s precursor, and of course, the White Negroni is a variation thereof. Invented in 2001 by British bartender Wayne Collins, the White Negroni uses Suze in place of Campari and Carpano Bianco as a stand-in for sweet vermouth, bringing a lightness and florality to its deeper, darker ruby-red cousin.

The beverage joins another eye-opening morning stalwart, the Bloody Mary , as a supreme brunch cocktail that is universally acceptable to enjoy before the clock strikes noon. Composed of sparkling wine and orange juice, the Mimosa was created around 1925 and named for a yellow-flowered plant. Its origin is often pegged to Frank Meier, a bartender at the Ritz hotel in Paris during that time. Meier eventually included the recipe in his 1936 book, “The Artistry of Mixing Drinks,” which is believed to be the Mimosa’s first appearance in print. It’s easy to see why the drink became a sensation. It’s refreshing and delicious, and even the most novice drinks-makers can remember the two-part recipe. The Mimosa is also a lighter serve than the high-octane Screwdriver , which skips sparkling wine in favor of vodka, so it’s a natural choice for morning consumption. With only two ingredients, you want to choose high-quality wine and juice—so, the opposite of what you will find at the bottomless pitcher places. Start with a good, dry Champagne or other sparkling wine like prosecco or cava. And, like all drinks demanding juice, fresh is always best, so squeeze a couple oranges for the rich citrusy flavor and added benefit of vitamin C. Once your ingredients are handled, the simple Mimosa doesn’t offer many opportunities to go off the rails. But be careful not to get too heavy-handed with the OJ. Rather than lengthening the cocktail with a hearty juice pour, be judicious with the juice. You want it to complement the sparkling wine instead of burying it. Build your Mimosa in a Champagne flute for a touch of elegance, and serve it alongside classic brunch fare like omelets, pancakes and toast. Or drink it whenever and with whatever you like. The Mimosa is too easygoing to care about silly things like conventions and rules.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/red-snapper/,Red Snapper,Liquor.com,"The Bloody Mary is a workhorse drink. It’s a favorite hangover remedy and a vitamin-packed breakfast that’s been jumpstarting mornings since it first landed in bars circa 1920 or 1930. The original recipe is believed to have contained seven ingredients: vodka, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, celery salt and Tabasco. But that recipe has been tweaked throughout the decades, and today you’ll find versions featuring a variety of spirits and garnished with everything from whole shrimp to mini burgers. The variations that show the most staying power tend to keep things simple, like the Bloody Maria , which calls for tequila, and the Red Snapper, which swaps out vodka for gin. This Red Snapper recipe hews closely to the original, with gin and tomato juice leading the way. Fresh lemon juice brings balance, while additional flavor arrives via celery salt, black pepper, hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. It’s easy to call the Red Snapper “just a Bloody Mary with gin,"" and you wouldn’t be wrong. But while the vodka-spiked version defers to the tomato juice and flavorful accessories, the gin stands tall in a Red Snapper, providing a sturdy backbone that shines through the cocktail’s other components. So if you like gin and really want to taste the booze in your brunch cocktail, this one’s for you. 12 Bloody Mary Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'pinches', 'ingredient': 'black pepper'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'pinches', 'ingredient': 'celery salt'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'wedge', 'ingredient': 'lime'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tomato juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Tabasco sauce'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Worcestershire sauce'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'celery stalk', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Pour the pepper and celery salt onto a small plate.', 'Rub the juicy side of a lime wedge along the lip of a pint glass, then rim the glass with the salt and pepper mixture, and fill the glass with ice.', 'Add the gin, tomato juice, lemon juice, Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass, and garnish with a celery stalk and lime wedge.']",63,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/timmys-brandy-milk-punch/,Brandy Milk Punch,Liquor.com,"When it comes to American cities who have put their mark on the global cocktail scene, it’s difficult to overstate the influence of New Orleans. The birthplace of drinks like the Sazerac , the Vieux Carré and the Ramos Gin Fizz, as well as bartending ingredients like Peychaud’s bitters, New Orleans has long been one of the top locales for cocktail innovation. One example of New Orleans’ contributions to the cocktail world is the Brandy Milk Punch. Like many other drinks, its history is somewhat cloudy, but the place that claims to have created it doesn’t face many arguments to the contrary: Brennan’s in New Orleans’ famed French Quarter assumes responsibility for the drink’s creation. Its roots go further back, and versions of it appeared in Ireland prior to its popularity in New Orleans, but the restaurant has served its current iteration at brunch since the 1940s. Though not as renowned or ubiquitous as the city’s other essential libations, the Brandy Milk Punch is a staple of New Orleans brunch culture. Many residents of the city would even say that it’s not truly breakfast at Brennan’s without a Brandy Milk Punch in hand. Much of the beauty of the drink lies in the simplicity. It’s a straightforward blend of milk, brandy, vanilla extract and powdered sugar. They are blended together and served over crushed ice for a creamy, frosty morning pick-me-up that packs a decent punch with two ounces of brandy in each glass. Generally, it’s made in larger batches that serve four; the drinks should be tasted for sweetness and adjusted with more powdered sugar if needed before serving. A gentle dusting of freshly grated nutmeg over the top finishes the drink. While the base spirit is right there in the name, there are variations that see bourbon used instead of brandy. Feel free to use whatever spirit you prefer, but it’s best to stick to the darker categories.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'milk'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'tablespoons', 'ingredient': 'powdered sugar, plus more to taste'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'vanilla extract'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the brandy, milk, powdered sugar and vanilla extract to a blender filled with ice and blend for 20 seconds.', 'Taste, and add more sugar if desired.', 'Double-strain the mixture into four tall glasses filled with crushed ice.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",33,brandy

The classics stick around for a reason and include popular drinks like the Espresso Martini and Irish Coffee . But creative bartenders didn’t stop there, and over the years they’ve workshopped numerous options to help you merge liquor with coffee. The Oaxacan Tail is a Mexican-themed cocktail that was cooked up as a brunch drink for Esters Wine Shop & Bar in Santa Monica, California. The drink combines two agave-based spirits, mezcal and tequila, plus amaro, cold-brew coffee and mole bitters. The amaro doesn’t only play a supporting role, as seen in many other cocktails. Instead, the recipe calls for a full ounce of Foro amaro, an Italian liqueur made with 25 botanicals that balance dark bitter notes with bright citrus. If you can’t find Foro, or want to use a bottle that’s already on your shelf, you can easily substitute other amari, such as Ramazzotti, Cynar or Averna. The Oaxacan Tail’s herbal backbone is complemented by the earthy zing of agave and a healthy 15 drops of chocolate mole bitters, plus the strong, rich cold-brew. The drink is great as is, but if you’d like to start your day (or end your night) on a slightly milder note, you can mellow the recipe with a dash of cream. In that case, you should still stir and strain the drink like usual, adding the cream as a modest topper at the end. 8 Coffee Cocktails to Perk You Up RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'amaro'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cold-brew coffee'}, {'quantity': '15', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}]","['Add the amaro, mezcal, tequila, coffee and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into an Old Fashioned glass over a large ice cube.']",14,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kombucha-mimosa/,Kombucha Mimosa,Liquor.com,"Elaborately garnished Bloody Marys and bubbly Mimosas are a staple of any brunch service, but they often lead to a two-hour power nap after eating and a lethargic rest of the day. But it doesn’t have to be that way, as many bartenders and restaurant owners have discovered more enlivening morning concoctions. Jennifer Peters, the founder of Denver’s gluten-free café Just BE Kitchen , developed her own take on the Mimosa, swapping its usual orange juice for kombucha, the naturally fermented, lightly effervescent tea drink. “People go crazy over the Kombucha Mimosas,” says Peters. “The best part is you’re getting probiotics in your bubbles.” The Kombucha Mimosa is perfect as a morning pick-me-up with a healthy brunch, or as an afternoon treat during tea time. It’s festive, bright, fun and bubbly, but its best aspect may be its versatility: There are dozens of kombucha flavors on the market , with a variety of tea bases, fruit flavors and levels of sweetness. Citrus kombuchas are an obvious fit in a Kombucha Mimosa, mimicking the usual juice, but other flavors can also work well. Try using a gingery or cinnamon kombucha during the winter months for a cool weather drink, or mint-infused kombucha for summertime drinking. Kombucha made with black or green tea will have more caffeine, while ones made with herbal teas deliver a more mellow experience. This Is How to Use Kombucha in Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE Along with a variety of flavors and styles there are also numerous companies producing kombucha, from small, local brands making individually bottled versions to bigger companies getting in on the scene with large-scale production. You could even try your hand at making your own kombucha; along with baking sourdough bread, it’s become a popular hobby in recent years. Once you’ve got a healthy scoby going (that’s the name for the culture that creates kombucha), you can make repeated batches of it, and add whatever kind of flavoring best suits your tastes. While the kombucha is one important aspect of the drink, the other ingredient to contend with is the choice of sparkling wine. Champagne is always a good bet, but for breakfast drinks like the Kombucha Mimosa, sometimes something bright and lighter, like cava or prosecco, is the way to go. Whatever the case, be sure to balance the levels of sweetness in the wine and kombucha or a risk an overly sweet, or overly tart, drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/espresso-milk-punch/,Espresso Milk Punch,Liquor.com,"The Milk Punch is a old cocktail, with roots dating to the late-1600s. Comprising a spirit, milk, sugar and usually vanilla, the drink sprang to life in England, traveled to Ireland and eventually came stateside. The current iteration is often associated with New Orleans, as the Brandy Milk Punch has been a staple of the city’s brunch culture, served at Brennan’s since the 1940s. Over the years, variations have sprung up, including simple and self-explanatory twists like the Bourbon Milk Punch as well as other versions featuring tequila and other spirits. Bartenders have also gotten creative by clarifying the milk for perfectly clear drinks, or by making dairy-free versions featuring milk alternatives. The Espresso Milk Punch sets itself apart by featuring bourbon, coffee liqueur, chicory liqueur, heavy cream and a ground espresso garnish. The recipe comes from Cavan in New Orleans. Though it’s now closed, the restaurant served this coffee-flecked spin on the classic brunch cocktail to weekend crowds looking for a tasty and caffeinated start to their days. It begin with a slug of 100-proof bourbon, which is straightforward enough. But then the ingredients take an interesting turn. Varnelli Caffe Mokka is an Italian espresso liqueur that is aged for at least six months and has aromas and flavors of coffee, cocoa, vanilla, spices, tobacco, honey and caramel. Hoodoo chicory liqueur adds a New Orleans flourish. The liqueur is made with roasted chicory root and Louisiana cane sugar and is an homage to the classic chicory coffee, a popular drink in New Orleans (and elsewhere) that’s made with nutty chicory root instead of—or addition to—coffee beans. You can recreate the Espresso Milk Punch at home by adding the alcoholic ingredients to a rocks glass with ice, topping with the cream and then garnishing with freshly ground espresso. Make one in the morning, after dinner to extend your night, or any time you want to channel New Orleans through a caffeinated, creamy cocktail.

But when the prior night’s extracurricular activities require a soothing pick-me-up, countless inhabitants of and visitors to the Crescent City opt for the fortifying charms of Milk Punch. The Milk Punch is an old drink. Printed recipes date its invention to at least the 1600s, well before its association with New Orleans. But French Quarter establishments like Brennan’s and Arnaud’s French 75 Bar deserve credit for perfecting the version as it’s known today. The drink can be made with a variety of spirits, from French brandy (a classic choice) to all-American bourbon, as seen in this recipe from Sarah Baird, author of “ New Orleans Cocktails .” The Bourbon Milk Punch combines its namesake spirit with whole milk, simple syrup and vanilla extract. Freshly grated nutmeg dusts the top of the drink, providing a sprinkling of warm aromatics with each sip. Think of the cocktail like Eggnog without the egg. It’s meant to be rich and creamy, so whole milk is the way to go here. Low-fat milk and certainly skim milk will produce a thinner, less satisfying drink, so it’s best to leave those for cereal. The Bourbon Milk Punch may be called on most often during brunch, but its comforting sensibilities also make it a great nightcap.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lunar-eclipse/,Lunar Eclipse,Liquor.com,"Lunar eclipses only occur a few times each year, but if you want to experience one more often, you can—you just need to mix up this Lunar Eclipse cocktail. It comes from bartender Matt Ragan, who created the drink while working at Victor Tangos, the former Dallas hotspot known for its gastropub plates and craft cocktails. Ragan wanted to offer his guests a turmeric-infused drink that could give them a healthy kick alongside their buzz, and he nailed it. Since turmeric vodka isn’t a commercially available product, you’ll need to make it for yourself. Fortunately, that is accomplished by simply adding chopped turmeric to a bottle of vodka and letting it sit for 24 hours. That earthy base spirit is joined by carrot juice, lemon juice, honey and aromatic bitters—and it’s all garnished with a celery stick. Fresh carrot juice is always the best option, as it adds vegetal sweetness and a gorgeous bright orange hue to the cocktail. If you have a juicer, great. If you don’t, that’s OK. Many green grocers and even big box grocery stores, like Whole Foods, sell fresh carrot juice, so you should be able to find it without much issue.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/frozen-margarita/,Frozen Margarita,Kevin Gray,"When the heat outside calls for a remedy, the practical solution is an ice-cold drink. Around the world, that often means Margaritas , the beloved cocktail combining tequila, orange liqueur and lime juice, usually served up or shaken and strained over ice. But if maximum frostiness is your goal, make it a Frozen Margarita, a much more recent variation that originated in Dallas and dates to 1971. Mariano Martinez opened Mariano’s restaurant that same year and quickly established it as one of the best places in Dallas to get sizzling fajitas and blended Margaritas. But he had a consistency problem. Serving so many guests each night, some drinks were rushed and unmeasured, while others sat too long at the bar and began to melt. He wanted a way to streamline the process so that each guest received a perfect cocktail. The answer came from an unexpected source: the Slurpee machines at 7-Eleven. After witnessing the machines in action, Martinez realized that he could apply the same principle to his Margaritas and outfitted an old soft-serve ice cream machine to pour the tequila-based drink . His problem was solved, and the slushy, uniform cocktails were a hit. Unfortunately, not everyone has a dedicated Frozen Margarita machine at home. If this is the case, you're most likely going to have to rely on a blender. While you can still making solo servings, the blender really shows its value when you’re making multiple drinks at once. In that case, you can scale up the recipe to account for the number of servings you require. The 8 Best Margarita Machines RELATED ARTICLE Martinez wasn’t the first person to blend a Margarita with ice, but he did invent the machine-made version that helped to popularize tequila, Tex-Mex joints and Mexican restaurants in America.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mexican-punch/,Mexican Punch,Liquor.com,"When hosting a large group for a party or other kind of get-together, one of the easiest and most time-honored ways of serving drinks is by making a big bowl of punch . These large format concoctions mean all the preparation happens ahead of the event, leaving you free to socialize and wrangle party-goers when needed, rather than keeping you behind the bar or in the kitchen all night. One such punch recipe is the Mexican Punch, which is easy to put together and whose ingredients are easy to source. While it might look like the sort of thing more commonly found at college parties than at cocktail bars, it comes from the James Beard Award-winning bartender Toby Maloney, co-owner of the lauded Violet Hour in Chicago and Nashville’s Patterson House . Given its name, it’s no surprise that the base—and only—spirit that goes into the Mexican Punch is tequila. You’ll want to use a blanco tequila, but other than that it’s up to you which brand to use. It’s best not to go too pricey, considering how many other ingredients go into the punch. The Mexican Punch doesn’t lack for citrus, with quartered lemons, limes and oranges, as well as seven ounces of lime juice. That acidity is needed, thanks to the sweetness of the other ingredients: simple syrup, grenadine and, oddly, a good deal of 7UP. While you can use whatever store-bought brand of grenadine you can find, the punch will end up much better if you use a good-quality one, with real pomegranate and no artificial flavorings. The best way to do so is to simply make it yourself . While it’s definitely more labor-intensive, your tastebuds will be able to tell the difference. 9 Perfect Punch Recipes for a Serious Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'limes'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemons'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange'}, {'quantity': '15', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '7', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '7', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '7', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'aromatic bitters'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': '7UP'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a large pitcher, muddle the limes, lemons and orange.', 'Add the tequila, simple syrup, lime juice, grenadine and bitters.', 'Stir well and add ice.', 'Top with the 7Up and stir gently.', 'Divide between 6 rocks glasses and garnish each with a lime wedge.']",10,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-oaxacan-punch/,Oaxacan Punch,Liquor.com,"Now that we’ve long since moved past the days of punches generally being sweetened bowls of fruit juice with a trace of liquor, there’s plenty of room for large format drinks with interesting and high-end ingredients. One exemplar is the Oaxacan Punch from Tad Carducci, an award-winning bartender and founder of Tippling Bros., a bar consultant group. In this smoky, herbaceous punch, Carducci uses equal parts mezcal and Averna, as well as grapefruit and lemon juices, agave nectar and ginger beer. Despite its most famous characteristic being its “smokiness,” mezcal has incredible range as a spirit, from crisp, slate-tinged mezcals to funky, heavily smoky expressions, and even bright and fruity ones. And while the vast majority of mezcal comes from Oaxaca, there are a number of other states in Mexico where the ancestral liquor is produced. Still, Carducci suggests Sombra mezcal for the Oaxacan Punch, a joven mezcal—that is, a young, un-aged expression—from Oaxaca. To that he combines an equal part of Averna , a bittersweet Sicilian amaro and classic digestif. This gives the punch a deep richness and botanical quality, which is offset by the acidic brightness of grapefruit and lemon juice. Some agave nectar, which pairs well with the mezcal, adds sweetness. Much of the volume of the punch comes in the form of ginger beer, which also gives the drink carbonation. It’s important to keep in mind the distinction between ginger beer and ginger ale, the latter of which is often sweeter with less gingery kick. Additionally, different ginger beers have different levels of sweetness and spice, so you may need to adjust your recipe accordingly. Part of the charm of punch is in its delivery: An ornate punch bowl with a large block of ice and slices of citrus floating merrily in the bubbly drink provides a beautiful centerpiece to any get-together. Don’t stress if you lack a proper punch bowl or a way to make large ice blocks, though. If you need to use smaller ice in a pitcher or bowl, consider cutting back on the added cold water to avoid overly diluting the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/leche-mexicana-mexican-milk/,Leche Mexicana (Mexican Milk),Liquor.com,"Chocolate milk: for many, it was a simple pleasure growing up, an afternoon treat to be enjoyed on occasion. For others, an indulgence enjoyed regularly into adulthood. But even those who haven’t downed a glass of chocolate milk since childhood can appreciate the drink when it has some booze thrown in. Enter the Leche Mexicana, or Mexican Milk, from spirit ambassador Armando Zapata. It’s a rich and creamy concoction that’s sure to please even the most “mature” of palates. Tequila, creme de cacao, and half-and-half may seem an unorthodox combination, but the drink does have precedent. Replace the tequila with some brandy, swap the half-and-half for cream and tweak the proportions, you have yourself an iconic cocktail, the Brandy Alexander , itself an offshoot of the gin-based drink, the Alexander. Besides, the Leche Mexicana stands on its own accords, with blanco tequila creating a brighter, lighter drink, though one still rich and creamy. While the recipe calls for a blanco tequila, the other ingredients are robust enough to stand up to aged tequilas. Something like a reposado or an añejo can provide an extra level of depth and boldness to the drink, and bring it more in line with a cocktail like a Brandy Alexander. However, do stick to tequila. Because trading it for, say, mezcal will bring an odd smokiness and earth to the drink, potentially muddying it. A sweet and frothy libation, the Leche Mexicana is most appropriate as an after-dinner treat or nightcap . Though the recipe doesn’t call for a garnish, dusting the top with freshly ground nutmeg adds a nice touch, and a bit of orange zest amplifies the tequila elements. Similarly, any sort of smaller glassware can be used, but using a coupe or Nick & Nora glass imbues the drink with extra elegance. Despite any advertisement-fueled adages about milk’s health benefits, the Leche Mexicana should not be considered remotely healthy. The calories alone should limit it to a “once in a great while” indulgence, though that might be hard to do after the first taste.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'half-and-half'}]","['Add the creme de cacao, tequila and half-and-half into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a small glass.']",11,tequila

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/la-perla/,La Perla,Liquor.com,"La Perla is an elegant aperitif created by bartender Jacques Bezuidenhout . In it, tequila and manzanilla sherry combine with pear liqueur for a bright and vivid cocktail that may become your new favorite aperitif . “I've always loved tequila, I’ve always loved sherry, and it was a natural thing for me to combine the two,” says Bezuidenhout. “Add a little bit of pear liqueur and you have this wonderfully dry apertivo-style drink.” For La Perla you’ll want to use a reposado tequila . That is a tequila that is briefly aged—more than two months, but less than a year. Bezuidenhout opts for Partida reposado tequila in his recipe, which is moderately priced but well-respected. However, feel free to use whatever reposado you prefer. Just remember: Only use 100%-agave tequila, as Bezuidenhout cautions. The Differences Between Blanco, Reposado, and Añejo Tequila RELATED ARTICLE The sherry element of the drink is relatively flexible. Though Bezuidenhout uses Domecq manzanilla sherry in his version of the recipe, it’s acceptable to substitute any other manzanilla. Also acceptable is the use of a fino sherry, which is nearly identical to manzanilla; manzanilla is made with the same process as fino but aged in a particular area along the coast. These delicate but assertive fortified Spanish wines are a great fit in cocktails, pairing nicely with most spirits. The one-to-one ratio of tequila and sherry in La Perla means the drink will be smooth and bold without being overly intoxicating. The third element of the drink is the pear liqueur, which sweetens La Perla and adds fruit notes, creating a nuanced and balanced concoction. Bezuidenhout uses Mathilde pear liqueur , from Maison Ferrand, in his La Perla. However, as with most ingredients these days, there are alternatives. France’s Drillaud , Austria’s Rothman & Winter and Oregon’s Clear Creek Distillery each make stellar examples of pear liqueur. Though La Perla was conceived of as pre-dinner libation, it can also be a pleasant nightcap. A cocktail that’s as easy to make as it is to drink, it’s a lovely option for entertaining or for quiet nights at home.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/white-dragon/,White Dragon,Liquor.com,"At first glance, the White Dragon appears to be a variation on the classic Margarita, with lemon juice instead of lime and the addition of egg whites. But the drink’s creator, bartending icon Jim Meehan, says, “...it’s actually a variation on a White Lady (the classic gin-based Daisy from the Savoy Cocktail Book) which is typically made with egg white.” In it, tequila takes the place of gin or brandy. Meehan, the founder of Please Don’t Tell in New York City and author of the “ PDT Cocktail Book ” and “ Meehan’s Bartender Manual, ” named the drink partially after its progenitor and partially after the tequila he originally made it with: Casa Dragones blanco tequila. Meehan thought the tequila had strong orange notes and wanted to build a drink that would enhance and build on those elements. Doing so, he felt that that lemon juice was a better fit than lime juice, which he found astringent in the cocktail. Despite the specificity of Casa Dragones’ orange qualities, if you have a blanco tequila at home you’d prefer to use, it should work plenty well provided its quality is decent. While a Margarita often receives a splash of simple syrup or agave syrup for sweetness, in addition to the orange liqueur, the White Dragon sticks to Cointreau alone. With the silkiness of the egg whites and the relatively sweeter citrus fruit, the drink doesn’t need any additional sugar. Finally, rather than a lime wheel for garnish, the orange notes of the White Dragon are enhanced by a twist of orange zest over the drink.

It was created by beverage director and sommelier Liz Martinez when she was working at The Purple Pig in Chicago. Here, a mezcal base integrates with Cynar and green Chartreuse , two herbal powerhouses. The mezcal brings earth and smoke, while Cynar—a low-proof digestivo made from 13 herbs and plants, most prominently artichokes—lends a bittersweet accent. Green Chartreuse amplifies the flavor (and the booze). It’s made with 130 herbs, plants and flowers and clocks in at 110 proof.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ready-fire-aim/,Ready Fire Aim,Liquor.com,"As mezcal became increasingly popular to mix with during the late 2010s and into the 2020s, bartenders discovered that the smoky Mexican spirit paired beautifully with flavors like honey and pineapple. Those ingredients shoot to kill in the Ready Fire Aim, from world-traveling bartender Steve Schneider. This smoky cocktail is bolstered by smoked chile bitters and a homemade honey-pineapple syrup for balance. Schneider starts his recipe with a joven mezcal, which means the mezcal is unaged. That is the overwhelmingly popular style of mezcal available in the United States, especially for bartending, so it should not be a problem to find. He doesn’t specify a brand, so any nice quality mixing mezcal will do. Because the Ready Fire Aim is essentially a mezcal sour, similar to a Margarita with mezcal, it also gets lime juice and a sweetener. In this case, the sweetener is a honey-pineapple syrup that’s spiked with peppercorns. Once made, home bartenders can use this sweet and zesty syrup in other drinks. Try swapping out the usual simple syrup in your favorite Margarita or Daiquiri for a peppery twist on a classic. What Is Mezcal? A Guide to Mexico’s Most Beloved Spirit RELATED ARTICLE Fresh pineapple juice (or canned) amplifies the flavors of the syrup, and also provides an extra level of foaminess. Pineapple juice foams considerably when shaken, which means the Ready Fire Aim doesn’t need an egg white to provide a surface on which to float the pink-peppercorn garnish. The pepper enhances the spice of the five dashes of smoked chile bitters from Hella Bitters. If you’re making this recipe for someone with a low tolerance for heat, you can reduce the amount of bitters used, but omitting them all together will significantly change the flavor profile of the cocktail.","[{'quantity': '1 3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey-pineapple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': '5', 'ingredient': 'Hella Bitters smoked chili cocktail bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pink peppercorn, ground', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the joven mezcal, honey-pineapple syrup, pineapple juice, lime juice and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a grind of pink peppercorn.']",49,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/loaded-pistol/,Loaded Pistol,Liquor.com,"As cocktail makers and drinkers have become more sophisticated, salt has been finding a regular home behind the bar . The element brightens and awakens even the most dormant ingredients, balances acidity and imbues a drink with exciting new layers. The most common use for salt is to line the rim of a beverage—most famously the Margarita —but using salt directly in the drink has its benefits, too. And as the American palate continues to crave fresh, new flavor combinations, infused salts are stepping into the spotlight. One such example is grasshopper salt, as is used in the Loaded Pistol. Created by Erick Castro, the co-founder of San Diego’s Polite Provisions , the Loaded Pistol uses a garnish of grasshopper salt to enhance the flavors of mezcal, sweet vermouth and Strega, but also to lend a unique aspect. “The beauty of infused salts is that they bring their own flavor, rather than a simple sensation such as salty, sweet or sour,” says Castro. And while many in the United States may find grasshopper salt unfamiliar, it’s a relatively commonplace product in Oaxaca; because of this, mezcal, also often coming the Mexican state, makes perfect sense to pair with it. You won’t have to go raid your nearby garden with a net to make grasshopper salt—dried grasshoppers can be found in speciality stores, Latin American markets, and, of course, on the internet. And while the recipe is easy enough to throw together, there’s also the option to order pre-made grasshopper salt. Making your own, though, has the benefit of trying the grasshoppers themselves. Consider serving a small bowl of them as an accompaniment to the drink. The Loaded Pistol also includes sweet vermouth and Liquore Strega , an Italian digestivo. The liqueur gets its signature yellow hue from saffron, though it contains around 70 other ingredients including mint and fennel. Highly botanical and unusually strong for a liqueur at 80-proof, it gives the Loaded Pistol a deep herbaceous complexity. This is aided by a dash of grapefruit bitters, which also brighten the lush tones of the cocktail.

The Moscow Mule , with vodka, ginger beer and lime is the most common version of the cocktail, while other iterations feature mezcal, bourbon and gin.

To do so, he makes his own pomegranate grenadine , eschewing any rosewater or orange blossom water, which are common additions but ones he says don’t play well in the drink. Instead, Nemcik uses a smaller amount of sugar to retain the tartness of the pomegranate juice.

Meant to pair with the aromatic Indian dishes served at the restaurant, this agave-spirit cocktail contains multiple infusions, including a green chile-infused blend of tequila, mezcal and pear cordial; a simple syrup infused with matcha, cilantro and mint; and a chile-salt mix for the rim.

And while it’s perfectly satisfying to pop open a bottle of your favorite effervescent pink wine and pour a glass (or three), there’s always room to enhance the experience . The Spring Fever comes from Jamie Steinberg, the general manager of Motel Morris in New York City, Steinberg adds a floral syrup, fresh fruit and bitters to a glass of rosé to craft a delicious warm weather treat. The New York bar director strongly suggests using Sassetti vino spumante rosé, his favorite sparkling rosé from Italy. Of course, he says, any quality pink bubbles will do to make this flower-forward, sweet, tart and festive cocktail. Aside from the rosé, the use of Nikolaihof elderflower syrup is a key ingredient to help give it a romantic tinge—the kind of drink you can imagine tasting in the garden of a queen. However, if you want increase the drink’s potency, you can swap the elderflower syrup for elderflower liqueur. St-Germain is far and away the most ubiquitous and recognizable brand, but others have sprung up in recent years as well. Another suggestion to give the drink a kick: Add an ounce of cucumber gin like Hendrick’s to help enhance both the booze level and that pretty floral essence. You could also use vodka, while a white rum would increase the fruitiness and grassy notes. Stay away from brown spirits unless you want a murky, muddled drink. Lastly, along with lemon juice and quartered strawberries, the Spring Fever gets a few dashes of rhubarb bitters.

It has become one of the bar’s most popular signature drinks. The Verbena is somewhat of a flavor rollercoaster, with its namesake herb ingredient bringing a soft, lemony creaminess to the tequila-based drink’s flavor profile. And the citrus fruits yuzu and calamansi brighten the cocktail, setting the stage for the small-yet-mighty garnish to shine. While the yellow flower bud—also referred to as the “buzz button”—might seem unassuming, the Szechuan button’s effect on drinks is quite the opposite. The bud releases a naturally occurring alkaloid that delivers an intense numbing or tingling sensation in the mouth. In response, the salivary glands temporarily go into overdrive, making your mouth water, which is quickly followed by a cooling sensation in the throat and back palate. Needless to say, cocktails that incorporate this wonder ingredient or garnish are like a sensation roller coaster. Boarini has found that the Szechuan button works well with citrus, ginger and vegetal flavors—all of which the Verbena showcases.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tealquila-sunrise/,Teal-quila Sunrise,Liquor.com,"The Tequila Sunrise is a 1970s cocktail with three ingredients—tequila, grenadine and orange juice—that is served unmixed to preserve its unique layered effect. The drink was especially popular during the decade (and also enjoyed a nice run during the ’80s), helped in part by its unofficial sponsorship of The Rolling Stones’ 1972 tour. The Teal-quila Sunrise is a variation on the original that’s as tasty as it is colorful. The Teal-quila Sunrise takes a few liberties from the classic while remaining similar in style. It subs raspberry syrup for grenadine , uses Grand Marnier orange liqueur in place of orange juice, and it achieves its blue hue from a dash of blue curaçao. Fresh lemon juice balances the sweetness with a dose of tart citrus. The recipe requires DIY raspberry syrup, but don’t worry: No special skills are required. If you can purchase raspberries and sugar, you can make raspberry syrup. The fruit is muddled to release its juices and then mixed with simple syrup and strained. The resulting liquid is bright red, fragrant, and flavorful, and it makes a great addition to cocktails, from this drink to others like the Clover Club . The syrup is poured into the glass first, creating a layer for the other ingredients—turned blue from the curaçao—to rest on. The eye-catching cocktail is then garnished with fresh berries and a lemon peel for extra panache.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/blackberry-mint-julep-margarita/,Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita,Liquor.com,"The Mint Julep and the Margarita are two springtime drinks that are inextricably linked with US holidays in the early part of May—the Kentucky Derby is held on the first Saturday of May, while Cinco de Mayo is, naturally, the fifth of May. At times this means that the two holidays fall on the same day, or at least the same weekend, which leads to the occasional two-in-one holiday. Often it gets nicknamed Derby de Mayo or Cinco de Derby. While not an officially recognized holiday, the confluence is a fun excuse to drink some drinks and watch some horse races. However, the question then becomes: Which drink do you indulge in? Frosty silver cups filled with crushed ice, bourbon and mint? Or a glass filled with tequila, triple sec and lime? With the Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita, from tequila expert Gaston Martinez, you can enjoy both drinks at once—with delicious results. There are a couple of key elements to this drink, and the primary one is the use of crushed ice. This allows for slow melting and dilution over time, mellowing the cocktail as it goes. Another is the choice of tequila. Though you would generally use a blanco or silver tequila in a Margarita, an aged variety more closely resembles the bourbon that you traditionally use in a Mint Julep. Employing honey syrup rather than simple syrup also brings the drink closer to a traditional julep, with bourbon ordinarily lending notes of honey. Using a stainless steel or, if possible, silver Julep cup is the best approach for this drink, allowing the vessel to form beautiful crystals of ice on the exterior. Furthermore, the wide mouth of the cup allows for more ice to be packed in like a snow cone. Those glasses are far from necessary—if you can’t get your hands on a traditional metal Julep cup, a highball or Collins glass fills in fine. After all, that’s what Churchill Downs , the home of the Kentucky Derby, serves its Juleps in, so it’s hard to impugn. And while the Blackberry Mint Julep Margarita is ideal for early May, there’s nothing keeping you from enjoying it anytime of the year, as long as you can find fresh mint and berries.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/green-derby/,Green Derby,Liquor.com,"The Brown Derby is one of those classic drinks that, for whatever reason, never earned the same illustrious status as many of its peers. According to legendary spirits and cocktail writer Dale DeGroff, in his book “ The Craft of the Cocktail ,” the Brown Derby was created sometime in the 1930s, though it’s unclear precisely where. It’s essentially a variation of a Whiskey Sour , with the recipe calling for grapefruit juice instead of lemon and honey or honey syrup instead of simple syrup. And though it’s not quite as popular as its contemporaries, it still crops up from time to time on cocktail lists, and is occasionally used as a template for playful tweaks. The Green Derby comes from bartending pro Lucinda Sterling, and utilizes a specific whiskey, as well as a few substitutions, to make a Rocky Mountain-inspired twist on the classic. The base of the drink, and one that can’t be readily swapped out, is Tincup whiskey. It combines a high rye bourbon from Indiana with Colorado single malt , and is cut with Rocky Mountain water. It evokes the spirit of the Rocky Mountains and the miners that would drink whiskey from tin cups. The spirit of the Rockies is enhanced by substituting the Brown Derby’s usual honey syrup with Grade A maple syrup, a lighter, brighter style of syrup. As that can be overwhelming if used as a sweetener on its own, the drink also calls for an equal part of ginger syrup, which gives it an extra gingery kick. Sterling doesn’t mess with the citrus juice, opting to keep the grapefruit juice rather than use any amount of lemon or lime. She does, however, add bitters to the drink, something the original lacks. Specifically, Sterling uses Orinoco Bitters from The Dead Rabbit , New York’s famed Irish bar. These aromatic bitters are made specially for the bar, but are available outside of New York via online markets and speciality stores. They help round the drink out for a juicy but bold and rich concoction.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/man-o-war/,Man o’ War,Liquor.com,"The Man o’ War cocktail is named for one of the greatest racehorses of all time, a horse that won 20 of the 21 races in which he competed. While Man o’ War (the horse) didn’t run in the Kentucky Derby, he won the other two legs of the Triple Crown—the Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes—in 1920, forever solidifying his place in racing’s history books. He was also the sire of Triple Crown winner War Admiral and the granddaddy of Seabiscuit, another famed thoroughbred, so Man o’ War’s ties to the sport are immense. Naturally, someone made a drink in his honor. It’s unclear who created the Man o’ War cocktail, but it’s believed to have been invented in the mid-20th century. It begins with a base of bourbon, perhaps in a nod to Kentucky and the most famous of all horse racing-related drinks, the Mint Julep . The bourbon is joined by orange liqueur (either orange curaçao or triple sec), plus sweet vermouth and lemon juice. Be sure the latter is freshly squeezed—fresh juice brightens the drink and balances the liqueur’s sweetness. This recipe comes from Allen Katz, the co-founder of New York Distilling Company and a leading expert on spirits and cocktails. You can make one for yourself during a race or anytime you want a well-made bourbon drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-black-demure/,Black Demure,Liquor.com,"The Black Demure comes from Franky Marshall, a New York City bartender and certified cognac educator who has worked at bars including Clover Club and the Dead Rabbit . In this lush and sweet whiskey drink, peppery bourbon balances the fruitiness of blackberry and orange liqueurs to create a pleasing and robust cocktail. At first glance, this whiskey drink bears a close resemblance to the Bramble , a gin-based cocktail from the 1980s that quickly became an all-time classic. The most notable similarity is the inclusion of creme de mure—this blackberry liqueur can be difficult to find but is a delicious and versatile product to include in your home bar. It also goes into the Tiki drink the Rum Runner , so if you pick up a bottle for the Black Demure, you’ve got options for other recipes. Like the Bramble, the Black Demure features lemon juice and simple syrup, but also includes a small volume of Cointreau . Considering that it only calls for a quarter-ounce, you could get away with using another orange liqueur, like Grand Marnier or Combier. But the biggest difference between the two drinks is the choice of base spirits. In Marshall’s creation, bourbon takes center stage. Specifically, she calls for Wild Turkey 81-proof bourbon, which has the benefit of availability as you can walk into just about any liquor store and find a bottle of it. But feel free to mix and match with your own favorites. Want more heft to bolster the drink? Try a bottle in the 100-proof category (even Wild Turkey 101). Looking for extra spice to balance the sweetness of the liqueurs? Try using a high-rye bourbon like Redemption or Jim Beam.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/trick-nog/,Trick Nog,Liquor.com,"Trick Dog is an award-winning bar in San Francisco. Trick Nog, however, is a modern and boozy twist on the classic Eggnog recipe. It comes from Morgan Schick, the creative director of The Bon Vivants , the team behind Trick Dog and other fine establishments. Eggnog recipes can vary depending on who makes them, but the basic formula consists of a spirit with eggs, sugar, milk and cream. This version hits all those notes, and then some, with bourbon, cherry liqueur, orange juice, brown sugar syrup, heavy cream and a whole egg. Schick’s take on the classic is a great example of how to build complementary flavors into the traditional combination of ingredients. In addition to the obvious components like cream and egg, the Trick Nog adds brown sugar syrup for depth and sweetness, orange juice for a delicate brightness and Heering cherry liqueur for rich cherry notes, producing a mixture with flavors reminiscent of a holiday fruit cake. This recipe involves a few more ingredients than the classic version, but it’s no more difficult to make. That’s because many Eggnog recipes instruct you to beat the egg yolks with sugar in a bowl until fluffy, add your liquid ingredients and then fold in the egg whites. But the Trick Nog is simply combined in a cocktail shaker. Shake everything together without ice until the ingredients are well-incorporated, and then give it another rattle with ice until chilled—no whisk required.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kentucky-mule/,Kentucky Mule,Liquor.com,"Though it's popularity has waxed and waned over time, the Moscow Mule remains one of the most popular cocktails in the United States. First created in Los Angeles in the 1940s (despite its namesake), the refreshing, effervescent combination of vodka, lime and ginger beer is a member of a broader family of cocktails called bucks—drinks that include ginger beer and citrus—which date to the late 1800s. The Moscow Mule is one of the best known cocktails of this kind, but the ""mule"" terminology itself has since extended to a wider array of drinks. The Kentucky Mule substitutes bourbon for vodka, hence the “Kentucky” moniker. The weightier profile of bourbon cuts through the ginger more noticably than vodka, resulting in a more flavorful drink than the original. For the best results, use a high-quality ginger beer with a spicier flavor profile that can better stand up to the whiskey. Or, if you’d like to experiment, you can try your hand at making your own ginger syrup . In that case, use club soda as your bubbly topper. The Kentucky Mule is exceedingly easy to make. Simply combine your ingredients with plenty of ice in a copper mug, if you have one. Otherwise, a highball glass will do. Garnish with mint, and you have an whiskey-based twist on the classic that you’ll want to drink all year long.

It’s a simple and elegant concoction, essentially a variation on a classic Whiskey Sour and a close cousin to the Ward Eight . The drink’s original incarnation called for rye whiskey, grapefruit juice, and grenadine , a common cocktail sweetener made with pomegranate juice. In recent years, however, fans of the cocktail have found that substituting raspberry syrup instead renders a far more delicious version of the drink. Over the years, bartenders have played with the cocktail’s proportions as well. This version comes from bar pro Naren Young, who affixes the quantities approximately to those of a standard sour-format cocktail. You’ll want to use freshly squeezed juice from a yellow grapefruit to ensure a balanced flavor; pink or ruby red grapefruit juice could lean too sweet. As for the rye, be sure to use a 100-proof version such as Rittenhouse. And for the sweetener, feel free to try the cocktail with grenadine as originally created, if you like—perhaps even back-to-back with the modern version and its raspberry syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pumpkin-nog/,Pumpkin Nog,Liquor.com,"When it comes to holiday drinks, it’s hard to think of one more iconic than Eggnog . Though the drink spent decades being relegated to store-bought mixtures, the so-called Cocktail Renaissance of the 2000s revitalized it and introduced people to the original from-scratch recipes . And while some Eggnog recipes lead to individual servings, large scale, punch-like formats of Eggnog are another popular way to enjoy the classic. Though people largely imbibe Eggnog in the winter months around the holidays, there’s no reason you can’t have it other times of year. While it might be a bit rich and milky for warmer days (for some reason, the idea of drinking Eggnog in the sun has little appeal), the fall is a perfect fit for it. The Pumpkin Nog comes from legendary bartender Tony Abou-Ganim, AKA The Modern Mixologist. In it, he uses fall’s most iconic squash to give the drink an autumnal touch. Not All Eggnogs Are Created Equal: 3 Recipes to Keep Close This Holiday Season RELATED ARTICLE The Pumpkin Nog hews closely to a traditional Eggnog recipe, save for the addition of pumpkin puree. Those who want to go all the way can always roast and puree their own pumpkin, but there’s nothing wrong with using the stuff from the can—it’s considerably less time consuming and generally more cost-effective. For the all-important alcohol aspect of the drink, Abou-Ganim uses 10 cane rum. However, given Eggnog’s versatility you can substitute another dark spirit. Something like brandy or bourbon would pair well with pumpkin, while using an aged tequila, like a resposado or añejo, would give the drink additional depth and earthiness. Because of its large scale format and the fact that it needs time to chill, it’s best to prepare the drink earlier in the day, before guests arrive. You can even make it the night before, though you won’t want to have it sitting any longer than that. It’s perfect for Thanksgiving revelries and for Halloween parties, and may replace the standard recipe as your favorite Eggnog.","[{'quantity': '12', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'eggs'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'pound', 'ingredient': 'sugar, divided'}, {'quantity': '750', 'unit': 'milliliters', 'ingredient': 'light rum'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'whole milk'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'pumpkin puree'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'vanilla extract'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'ground cinnamon'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: whipped cream', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: freshly grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Separate the eggs and refrigerate the whites.', 'In a mixing bowl, beat the yolks until creamy.', 'Gradually add in 1/4 pound sugar, beating at high speed until thick.', 'Stir in the rum, milk, pumpkin, vanilla and cinnamon, and chill for at least two hours.', 'Beat the egg whites until soft peaks form.', 'Add the remaining 1/4 pound sugar, beating the egg whites to stiff peaks.', 'Fold the chilled rum mixture into the egg whites.', 'Serve in Martini glasses garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and freshly grated nutmeg.']",10,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/planters-punch/,Planter’s Punch,Liquor.com,"Planter’s Punch is a simple mixture of rum, citrus, sugar and spice. This classic drink has been quenching thirsts since the late-1800s, but its origins are murky. Though hotels in Charleston and St. Louis are associated with the cocktail, it’s more likely that it originated in Jamaica. Several accounts credit the Planter’s Punch to Myers’s Rum. The Jamaican rum brand sold a Planter’s Punch Rum to be used specifically in the cocktail, and this product helped to popularize the recipe among drinkers. The cocktail was fashionable in the United States through the 1960s, until the Tiki craze began to subside. The cocktail lost its luster over the years, but it was revived during the Tiki renaissance of the 2000s and resurfaced in cocktail books, like Ted Haigh’s influential 2009 tome, “Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails.” Recipes vary for the Planter’s Punch. An old sing-song template calls for “one of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak,” with the latter coming from water or ice, but modern recipes adjust these ratios or change the formula entirely. There isn’t one right way to make it, so feel free to give the drink your personal spin. This recipe sticks with three parts strong (the rum), while employing nearly equal measures of sugar and citrus for the sweet and sour components. It also receives a dose of spice and complexity from the Angostura bitters, with a dash of soda water for dilution and effervescence. Combine the ingredients with plenty of ice for a tall, refreshing cocktail that channels Jamaica’s warm climate and sandy beaches. 9 Perfect Punch Recipes for a Serious Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dark rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'splash', 'ingredient': 'club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dark rum, simple syrup, lime juice, grenadine and bitters into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Collins glass over crushed ice, and top with a splash of club soda.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",71,rum

Today, punch often gets a bad rap as a cheap drink laden with sweet mixers and fake juice, but when done right, it can be a well-balanced, delicious drink. The Cardamom & Pop Punch recipe comes from Phil Ward, the accomplished bartender who has worked behind the stick at some of New York’s best bars, including Death & Co., Mayahuel and Pegu Club. It covers all the bases, featuring the five tenets of a classic punch, plus orange bitters for an added dash of complexity. Ward chooses an aged Nicaraguan rum as his spirit. He then enlists fresh lime and grapefruit juices, green cardamom pods, sugar and club soda. The cardamom pods are muddled to release their flavors and aromatics, giving the drink a zesty green note that complements the rum and citrus, while the soda supplies refreshing effervescence. If you want to make this punch for a crowd, simply scale up the recipe by multiplying the ingredients by the desired number of servings. You can make a large batch and serve it in a punch bowl or carafe at your next party.

Traditionally composed of a spirit, citrus, spice, sugar and water, punch is one of the earliest known cocktail templates, and ever since its creation, bartenders and drinkers have experimented to make countless recipes. Punch can be made as as single serving, but today it’s more common to create large batches meant to serve a crowd. Large-scale punches are perfect party drinks because because they allow guests to serve themselves, which is convenient for them and for the host. The best punches are refreshing, delicious and easy on the eyes, often decorated with edible garnishes and served in attractive bowls. The Rainbow Planter’s Punch checks all of these boxes. It’s an instant-party-in-a-bowl that serves six and was created by New York cocktail legend and author Dale DeGroff . This recipe is a riff on the classic Planter’s Punch , a simple mixture of rum, lime, sugar, grenadine and bitters. But DeGroff dials it up a few notches by combining dark rum, light rum, orange curaçao, allspice dram, orange juice, pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine, simple syrup and bitters. The ingredients join forces to produce a Tiki-lover’s dream: The punch is tart, refreshing and packs a wallop.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/green-acres-punch/,Green Acres Punch,Liquor.com,"Punch is a popular but loosely defined style of drink —while the majority of punches rely on a large format to define themselves, there are ways to make individual drink portions in line with a punch style. Normally, this means a mix of spirit, wine, fruit juice, sweetener and sometimes tea, though it’s flexible. The Green Acres Punch, from New York City bar professional Phil Ward, is a single-serving drink, but his use of green tea, rum and citrus give it a punch-like flavor profile. The base of the drink is a mix of two different rum expressions from Flor de Caña, an affordable and well-regarded rum from Nicaragua. Ward uses the commonly found 4-year-old as the main base, but also adds a full ounce of the more expensive 18-year-old, a rich and celebrated rum. The bright fruit notes and subtle caramel flavors add depth to this punch. The addition of demerara simple syrup and lime juice means that the Green Acres is essentially a very strong Daiquiri , but that gets balanced with an additional ingredient: 6 ounces of chilled green tea. This brings the Green Acres more in line with an actual punch, as they often contain tea. The choice of green tea is up to you, but using a fine loose leaf tea like a sencha, rather than a cheaper bagged tea, will invariably lead to a more complex and better tasting punch. After all, the quality of ingredients directly affects the overall drink. Rather than chilling the ingredients in an ice-filled shaker or serving it over ice, the Green Acres spends time in the fridge. This allows all the ingredients to thoroughly meld and integrate, as well as chill without any dilution—with six ounces of green tea, it could otherwise be too watery. 9 Perfect Punch Recipes for a Serious Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Flor de Caña 4-year-old rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Flor de Caña 18-year-old rum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demerara rich simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'green tea, brewed and chilled'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine the rums, demerara rich simple syrup, lime juice and green tea in a bowl or other container, cover, and let stand overnight at room temperature.', 'Fine-strain, discarding solids, and refrigerate until chilled.', 'Pour into a wine glass.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",0,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/boston-rum-punch/,Boston Rum Punch,David Wondrich,"For a major American city, Boston has accounted for a paltry share of classic cocktails. There’s the Ward Eight, of course, a sort of fancied-up Whiskey Sour that, legend has it, was created at Frank Locke’s Wine Rooms in 1898. After that, there’s—well, there ain’t. One is entitled to wonder why that is. Could it be that Bostonians don’t drink? It couldn’t; they do. Or do they lack the mental acuity to combine alcoholic and non-alcoholic ingredients in just proportion? That won’t wash, either—Boston has always been a smart town. The real reason, I think, is Rum Punch. Once Boston discovered this simple potion, sometime around the turn of the 1700s, it must have said to itself, “what could be better than this?” and quit monkeying about with bottles and whatnot. The American Revolution was planned over bowls of it at places like the Green Dragon Tavern and Chase & Speakman’s Distillery. (Up until Prohibition, New England produced a great deal of rum out of Caribbean molasses.) Post-Independence, the merchants who made the city wealthy drank Rum Punch in their clubs, and everyone else enjoyed it in the saloons. You could buy the elixir by the bowl, by the glass or even by the bottle (pre-mixed “Hub Punch” was a 19th-century staple). But a proper Boston Rum Punch is an exceedingly straightforward affair. As one local bartender with a reputation for serving it explained to a Boston Globe reporter in 1889, “It is not always the elaborateness of the drink that makes it acceptable to the taste.” He suggested readers “simply take a good dose of first quality rum, put it into a glass with cracked ice [and] pour over it a dipper of liquid from the lemonade bowl.” If you begin with a rich and flavorful dark rum—and Bostonians pride themselves on their discernment in this matter—and make as little intervention as possible, it’s hard to fail.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Smith & Cross Traditional Jamaica rum'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Lemonade'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry half', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a shaker with finely cracked ice.', 'Add the rum and fill the shaker with lemonade.', 'Shake briefly and pour (unstrained) into a pint glass.', 'Garnish with half a strawberry and an orange slice.']",57,rum

But then again, not all orange liqueurs are made from cognac like Grand Marnier is. This elegant French orange liqueur can upgrade your Sidecar or Margarita , or it can serve as the base of a cocktail, as it does in the Le Grand Louis. “It’s a fantastic base to build from and works in a variety of styles of cocktails,” says the drink’s creator, Franky Marshall. A New York City bartending vet, Marshall believes Grand Marnier is incredibly mixable, and developed this silky, sophisticated cocktail to demonstrate it. “I love the body that it brings to cocktails,” she says. “The 40-percent ABV means it can stand up to anything you pair it with.” In Le Grand Louis, she uses a full two ounces of Cuvée Louis Alexandre, the higher-end expression that’s named in ode to its creator, Louis-Alexandre Marnier Lapostolle. However, the signature formula works equally well. The recipe is essentially a Dry Martini , substituting the usual London dry gin for the orange liqueur. It’s up to the bartender to decide on which vermouth to use, but using a nice French label, like Noilly Prat or Dolin Dry, will have the best results.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-brotherhood/,Brotherhood,Liquor.com,"Irish whiskey is a versatile spirit that ranges from simple mass-market blends to complex single malts. But its association with St. Patrick’s Day often blurs the nuances between bottles and results in the liquor being knocked back as a shot or mixed into simple (but delicious) cocktails like the Irish Coffee or Irish Shot . Drinkers should enjoy the fun-loving spirit however they prefer, but it’s always good to have an elegant Irish whiskey cocktail like The Brotherhood in your back pocket. The Brotherhood is an alliance of Irish and French spirits from Charles Joly, a Chicago bartending veteran and the co-founder of Crafthouse Cocktails, a bottled cocktail company. It merges Michael Collins blended Irish whiskey with Benedictine and Grand Marnier , plus lemon juice for sharp balance. Michael Collins is an affordable blend of malt and grain whiskeys that is double distilled and then aged in ex-bourbon casks. Its light nature works well in cocktails, but if you can’t find Michael Collins, you can substitute another blended Irish whiskey. Benedictine is a French liqueur made from a secret recipe of 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon and juniper, and has a sweet, herbal profile. It pairs well with whiskey, as seen in other drinks like the Monte Carlo and Preakness . In this recipe, it’s used liberally at three-quarters of an ounce, imbuing the cocktail with Benedictine’s sweet, rich flavor. Grand Marnier is a French orange liqueur made from cognac, bitter orange essence and sugar. Its versatile flavor profile lends itself to everything from the Margarita to other Irish whiskey cocktails, like the Dubliner (Irish whiskey, Grand Marnier, sweet vermouth, orange bitters). Fresh lemon juice balances the strong liqueurs with tart citrus, creating a friendly package that tastes great and walks the line between spirit-forward and refreshing. You don’t need to wait until St. Patrick’s Day to enjoy the Brotherhood.

Pizano likes the way Fernet-Branca imparts complexity to drinks while cutting through other rich or sweet ingredients. In this equal-parts cocktail that bears more than a passing resemblance to a Naked & Famous, itself a take on a Last Word , he melds the bitter amaro with yellow Chartreuse, which lends complementary notes of honeysuckle, saffron and menthol. “The demerara carries both spirits into a silky smooth jaunt that’s awoken by the bright acidity of the lime juice,” he says.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gold-rusher/,Gold Rusher,Liquor.com,"Drinking is inexorably linked to football parties, from tailgate gatherings to Super Bowl get-togethers. Normally it’s all about the kegs rather than cocktails, with the Bloody Mary for daytime games being the only mixed drink with a close association to football. However, plenty of bartenders are also fans of the contact sport, and some from NFL hometowns have crafted drinks in homage to their respective teams. Once such bartender is Helen Diaz of San Francisco, the home of the 49ers. Though the team is technically based about 45 miles away in Santa Clara, at Levi’s Stadium, it’s still closely associated with the city it grew up in. There’s also a close association between the team name and a classic cocktail, the Gold Rush , essentially a Whiskey Sour with honey syrup rather than simple syrup. “The original 49ers were gold seekers that came through California in 1849 during the Gold Rush,” says Diaz. “When I think about the 49ers, I think Gold Rush, and then I think of the Gold Rush cocktail. This is the Gold Rusher.” Rather than a straightforward Gold Rush, Diaz adapts it as an homage to San Francisco by adding a key ingredient that is as much a part of Bay Area culture as the sports team is: Fernet-Branca. “What better way to represent this team but to add a little Fernet to the drink?” she says, reminding us that San Francisco consumes more Fernet than any other place in the country. Beyond being the city’s favorite amaro, Fernet-Branca adds a botanical depth and richness to the cocktail, as well as a more burnished gold hue.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fernet-Branca'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ginger solution'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': 'sprig', 'ingredient': 'mint'}]","['Add the bourbon, Fernet-Branca, lemon juice, ginger solution, honey syrup and Angostura bitters to a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain over a large hand-cut chunk of ice into a rocks glass.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",15,bourbon

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/nail-in-the-coffin/,Nail in the Coffin,Liquor.com,"The spirit-forward Nail in the Coffin cocktail was created by bartender Brian Means while working at Dirty Habit , the fifth-floor restaurant and bar located within Hotel Zelos in San Francisco’s SoMa neighborhood. He combined Japanese whisky with dry Madeira wine, Licor 43 and Fernet-Branca and quickly found fans of his unique drink. The cocktail appears in Daniel Yaffe’s book, “ Drink More Whiskey ,” as an example of a modern way to mix with Japanese whisky. According to Means, the cocktail is a twist on the Rusty Nail , the classic two-part drink combining scotch with Drambuie. In this case, Japanese whisky takes the place of scotch (the malt whiskies have similar profiles), and Licor 43—a sweet and citrusy Spanish liqueur that is flavored with vanilla—is subbed for Drambuie. Madeira, a fortified Portuguese wine, adds structure and body, while Fernet-Branca provides a kick of its trademark bitterness. The amaro is made from a secret blend of 27 herbs, roots and spices, including saffron, rhubarb, chamomile and gentian. Stirred together, the full-flavored ingredients produce a complex and delicious drink, and the liquid is topped with fresh shaved black cardamom, which complements each sip with earthy, smoky and floral aromas.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kanar-sazerac/,Kanar Sazerac,Liquor.com,"Despite the fact that “Star Trek” is one of the most enduring science fiction franchises ever, with more than half a century of material to draw from, canonical cocktails are few and far between. Even bartenders like Quark or Guinan don’t have much to offer audiences outside of the occasional Romulan ale or Klingon Blood Wine. Luckily, bartenders and writers have developed a number of drinks that evoke the spirit of the utopian world of Star Trek. That way, you can enjoy one (or more) while watching episodes from your favorite era, whether that’s the original series, “The Next Generation,” “Deep Space Nine” or any of the later shows. The Kanar Sazerac, from bartender, writer and consultant John deBary , is one such Trek-inspired cocktail. The drink gets its name from the liquor that the nefarious and militaristic Cardassians drank on “Deep Space Nine.” A gray-skinned, authoritarian race, the Cardassians are a bitter people who often crave a stiff drink, so a Sazerac might be their go-to after a long day of selling their souls to the Dominion or oppressing the Bajoran people. Since it would be challenging to get your hands on a bottle of real Kanar (it being a fictional beverage and all) the base of the Kanar Sazerac is split between Fernet-Branca —the popular Italian amaro—and cognac, which may or may not have been the original spirit used to make Sazeracs before rye whiskey got involved. The two together make a lush and rich base with a touch of bitterness, which feels appropriate for a Cardassian libation. Rather than the traditional absinthe (or Herbsaint) that rinses the glass of the Sazerac, this version gets an extra dose of bitters—orange and Angostura, instead of the bright red Peychaud’s Bitters normally called for. The salt rim balances the bitterness and seems fitting for a species that throws back fish juice for breakfast. However, this drinks sticks to tradition when it comes to the vessel and garnish: a chilled rocks glass with no ice, and a lemon zest expressed over the top then discarded like a treaty with the Federation. 5 'Star Trek' Cocktails to Try Now FEATURED IN",[],"['Rim half of a chilled Old Fashioned or rocks glass with salt and set aside.', 'Add the Fernet-Branca, cognac, simple syrup, Angostura bitters and orange bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass.', 'Express the oils from a lemon peel over the top of the drink and discard peel.']",18,
https://www.liquor.com/death-by-morning-cocktail-recipe-5075630,Death by Morning,Liquor.com,"When bar guests request a “bartender’s choice” cocktail containing absinthe from Dzu Nguyen, the beverage director for Horsefeather in San Francisco, his go-to is this riff on an Espresso Martini . Its name, Death by Morning, is a play on the classic absinthe-and-Champagne cocktail Death in the Afternoon , created by author Ernest Hemingway, and Nguyen’s creation incorporates elements of both drinks. The Death by Morning doesn’t have too much in common with Hemingway’s drink, but it does have the author’s favorite liquor: absinthe . This botanical, anise-driven spirit does not, in truth, cause hallucinations and is perfectly legal to use in the United States. Nguyen prefers to use Vieux Pontarlier absinthe from France for “its deep complexity and the fact that it’s not just pungent star anise to the face,” he says. Its notes of grassy fennel, mint and menthol make it elegant and versatile. The absinthe forms the base of the cocktail, but it’s joined by Branca Menta—a minty take on Fernet-Branca’s flagship spirit—and coffee liqueur. These days, there are plenty of options for coffee liqueurs, and whatever you don’t use making the Death by Morning can go in drinks like the White Russian , Mudslide and, of course, the Espresso Martini. Coffee liqueur isn’t the only caffeine in the drink—it wouldn’t be an Espresso Martini variation if there wasn’t some actual coffee in it. While the name implies you must use espresso, you can substitute cold-brew concentrate, instead. If you go this route, keep in mind that cold brew packs a potent punch of caffeine, even more so than espresso. The drink is finished with sugar, Angostura bitters and coarse sea salt. The salt won’t make the drink salty, but it cuts the bitterness of coffee while amplifying the other elements. The result is lush, botanical, sweet and caffeinated. Hemingway would have likely approved.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/stags-leap/,Stag’s Leap,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to conjure a more popular yet derided spirit than Jägermeister . More commonly referred to as “Jäger,” often in tones of deep contempt, the German amaro is commonly associated with university hijinks and poor youthful decisions. Some of the blame must be placed on the Jäger Bomb , a mixture of Jägermeister and some kind of energy soda, primarily Red Bull. A hallmark of college parties, the concoction is a cloying, syrupy drink that has probably turned more people off of Jägermeister than it has made people fans. It’s too bad, as the spirit itself is perfectly commendable. A deeply botanical spirit, it’s made with 56 herbs and spices infused in neutral spirits and aged in oak. Like other amari including Fernet Branca , it’s often treated as an after dinner drink for digestion, and also serves well as a cocktail ingredient. The Stag’s Leap is one such drink that helps elevate Jägermeister’s beleaguered reputation, and demonstrates what a nice spirit it can be when used well. The drink—whose name is inspired by the stag’s head featured on Jägermeister bottles—comes from bartending icon Sother Teague. Teague is well known for his bar program at New York City’s Amor Y Amargo , one that was revolutionary when it opened in 2011 for its bar program that focused on bitters, vermouth, and amari. The Stag’s Leap is indicative of the bar menu, as it’s made with equal parts Jägermeister and sweet vermouth, dashed with bitters and topped with club soda for a botanical, herbal and refreshing highball. The bitters Teague uses in his highball are also a New York product. Devil’s Larder Root Beer Bitters are made in Brooklyn, and enhance the already present notes of root beer that are in Jägermeister. Teague is less specific in his sweet vermouth selection, but considering the drink’s origin it’s best to err on the side of higher quality. Something like Dolin Sweet Vermouth offers a lovely blend of sweet, bitter and botanical while remaining affordable, while a vermouth like Punt E Mes will add even darker notes of bitterness and botanicals. Carpano Antica Formula is pricey, but will elevate the drink even more with its complexity and richness. Served over ice and topped with club soda, the resulting drink puts in the work to help alleviate some of the negativity that Jägermeister has received over the years. Try surprising your next dinner guest with the Stag’s Leap and see if they can even tell what’s in it. You might just change their, and your own, perspective on Jäger.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Jägermeister'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Devil’s Larder Root Beer Bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}]",['Add all ingredients to a Collins glass and fill with ice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/la-tour-eiffel/,La Tour Eiffel,Liquor.com,"La Tour Eiffel was created by the late cocktail expert and author Gary “Gaz” Regan in 2007. He was inspired to make the drink on a trip to Cognac, France, in which he toured distilleries, drank cognac and otherwise experienced the region and its eponymous spirit. Regan imagined what the Sazerac would be like if it were invented in France instead of New Orleans. It is believed that the Original Sazerac may have contained cognac instead of the rye whiskey it’s typically made with today. This makes sense, as cognac was prevalent in French-influenced New Orleans around the time of the drink’s birth. Regan took this idea and ran with it, merging cognac with a slew of other French ingredients in an attempt to approximate the Sazerac’s charms. The result, which he dubbed La Tour Eiffel, keeps the absinthe, replaces simple syrup with Cointreau (a robust orange liqueur made with sweet and bitter orange peels) and skips the Peychaud’s bitters in favor of Suze, a bitter and aromatic gentian-flavored digestif. (Suze was created in 1889, the same year the Eiffel Tower opened, hence the cocktail’s name.) Once your French ingredients are secured, you build the drink in a similar fashion as the Sazerac, rinsing the glass with absinthe before stirring the remaining components with ice and serving in the absinthe-accented glass. Regan served the cocktail during that fateful trip for a room full of cognac dignitaries.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/strawberry-pisco-sour/,Strawberry Pisco Sour,Liquor.com,"The traditional Pisco Sour features pisco—a grape-distilled spirit made in Peru and Chile—fresh citrus, sugar and egg white. Its earthy, sweet and tart flavor profile and rich texture make it a favorite choice among drinkers, but as witnessed with all classic cocktails, enterprising barkeeps are never satisfied with the status quo. Bartender Naren Young , best known for his work at Dante in New York, created this fruit-forward take on the original. The Strawberry Pisco Sour covers all the key elements you expect (pisco, lime, sweetener and egg white), but it enjoys a couple liberties from the original recipe. To start, it skips the shaker in favor of a blender. And, rather than muddling strawberries—a fine option, to be sure—Young takes the extra step of making a homemade strawberry-rose syrup to sweeten the drink. The syrup is composed of fresh strawberries, rose syrup and sugar, and it’s cooked in a similar fashion to other infused simple syrups . It takes a little extra effort to produce the syrup, but with a batch on hand, you can make Strawberry Pisco Sours or other cocktails at your leisure.

The most well-known versions of the drink are the Gin Fizz and its creamier variation the Ramos Gin Fizz , from New Orleans. The Soda Jerk, from bartending veteran Kevin Diedrich, relies on a base spirit rarely seen in fizzes. “This drink is a great variation on a fizz with tequila,” he says. The Soda Jerk combines a high-quality blanco tequila with the famous Italian amaro Campari , as well as passion fruit puree and lime juice. It’s important to go with an unsweetened puree—not a passion fruit syrup that you might see in a Tiki drink like the Sea of Confusion or Smuggler’s Cove’s take on a Hurricane .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/garibaldi/,Garibaldi,Liquor.com,"This classic Italian cocktail couldn’t be simpler. It combines just two ingredients: Campari and orange juice. Some early versions of the cocktail call for a one-to-one ratio, but upping the juice creates a more balanced drink. It’s a winning flavor profile that Naren Young of award-winning bar Dante in New York City has distilled down to a science. Thanks to Young’s time at Dante, this relatively obscure classic has made a major comeback in New York’s drinks scene since Dante’s 2015 opening. Like many cocktails that have withstood the test of time, the Garibaldi comes with a story—even if the origins of the drink itself are unknown. Named for Giuseppe Garibaldi, a crucial figure in the liberation of both Italy and Uruguay, the red-orange drink represents the red shirts worn by Garibaldi’s followers, or the Garibaldini. Campari, which hails from Piedmont in northern Italy, along with the orange juice and wedge (both nods to Sicily in the south), together represent the idea of the country’s unification, the cause that drove Garibaldi in his life and work. Though made with only those two ingredients, there is a secret to perfecting the Garibaldi. It lies in the technique used to add texture to the juice. The OJ should be freshly squeezed and “fluffy,” or aerated, either using a Breville (or similar) juicer that spins at such a high speed that it aerates the juice, as they do at Dante, or with a handheld frother or by blending it at high speed without ice. The frothy texture helps soften the Campari’s signature bitterness.

It all depends on how you balance the ingredients,” he says. Though it’s generally used as a modifier, taking a back seat to other booze like gin or bourbon, he says it can just as easily be a base, as in his Novara Sour, which contains two full ounces of the liqueur. “Campari used to be the bad boy in cocktails back in the day; either you loved it or hated it.” But now, he doesn’t have to convince people to try it. The Novara Sour merges Campari with ginger syrup, fresh lemon juice, Creole bitters and egg white , the latter giving the drink a rich texture and silky mouthfeel. Once shaken and strained, the cocktail becomes a gorgeous deep-red color with a white halo on top, looking as good as it tastes. And because Campari has a moderate alcohol content—it clocks in at just 48 proof, or 24-percent ABV—this sour is the perfect pour when you want all the flavor without as much alcohol. What the #$@!

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/london-toddy/,London Toddy,Liquor.com,"Normally, Hot Toddies are considered winter drinks, meant to be imbibed in the cold months of the year to warm the body up. However, there’s no good reason to avoid the occasional hot beverage in the summertime, especially on a cooler evening or in more temperate locales. The London Toddy might be served warm, but it’s enjoyable any time of the year thanks to its bright and herbal profile. One aspect of the London Toddy that makes it more summertime-friendly (and where it gets inspiration for its name) is the base spirit. Rather than the ubiquitous Hot Toddy bases—bourbon, cognac, aged rum—this concoction starts with gin. A good London dry is the way to go here, but you don’t need to be too picky—whatever you use for your Negroni or Martini will do the job. Another way the London Toddy distinguishes itself from others in the category is in its choice of sweetener. The recipe calls for a cardamom rock candy syrup, which is essentially a simple syrup flavored with cardamom and vanilla bean. A delicious product itself, it can also be used in your favorite Old Fashioned recipe to add an herbal kick, or to boost the botanicals in an aquavit drink. Finally, in addition to the requisite hot water, the London Toddy calls for a few healthy dashes of both Angostura and Peychaud’s Bitters. These not only give the drink color, but also a deep botanical profile to bolster that of the gin. The result is hot, herbal and lush while remaining bright and crisp, perfect for a late summer evening.

That versatility shines in the London Light, an easy-to-make recipe by Michael Waterhouse, a longtime New York City bartender and bar consultant. Waterhouse starts with Bulldog gin, an assertive London dry gin that sports a robust juniper profile that pairs well with the drink’s other ingredients. He then enlists pomegranate juice for its mix of sweet and tart flavors, plus fresh grapefruit juice. The grapefruit juice is a natural pairing with gin: The duo is found in several other cocktails, including the classic Greyhound . A topper of club soda gives the package a vein of bubbly effervescence. The London Light is tart, refreshing, and a good choice on warm days when you don’t want your drink to weigh you down. Aside from the flavor, the best part of this drink is how easy it is to make.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/under-the-mistletoe/,Under the Mistletoe,Liquor.com,"The winter holidays are a festive time of year, known for good food, festooned trees, family gatherings and, provided you didn’t make anyone’s naughty list, even presents. Some celebrations may also include mistletoe. Today, this green herb is mostly used as a kiss-inducing seasonal decoration, but it dates back centuries and was once used as a cure-all for health ailments and a symbol of fertility. You don’t need to know any of that to drink the Under the Mistletoe cocktail, but your house guests may appreciate the anecdotes while you make them this tart refreshment. The drink, which was created at Big Bar in Chicago, starts off Christmas-y with muddled cranberries and oranges in simple syrup. It then adds gin, cranberry juice and club soda, before a final garnish of a thyme sprig and fresh cranberries. Muddling the fruit with the simple syrup releases the cranberries’ tart juices and the oranges’ sweet, citrusy juices, providing a fresh base for the cocktail. The recipe specifically calls for London dry gin, which prominently features juniper and tends to have a dry, bracing flavor. London dry gins are workhorses in cocktails, used in classics like the Martini and Tom Collins . You can experiment with a more modern, western-style gin that focuses on citrus and florals, just know that the resulting character will vary from a cocktail made with a drier gin. When selecting your cranberry juice, aim for real juice, not cranberry juice cocktail. The former features 100-percent juice, while the latter adds sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Since the recipe already calls for simple syrup, you don’t need that extra sweetness. The dry gin and tart cranberry juice are tempered by the simple syrup and club soda, yielding a crisp cocktail that tastes great and goes down easy. The one-two punch of muddled cranberries and cranberry juice ensures the drink looks the part, too, with a red color indicative of the season. Make a few Under the Mistletoes the next time Christmas (or cranberry season) rolls around, and you’ll ensure that at least one facet of your holiday gathering goes off without a hitch. 11 Cocktails to Make for Christmas RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cranberries'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange half-wheels'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'London dry gin'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Cranberry juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'thyme sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cranberries'}]","['In a Collins glass, muddle the cranberries and orange half-wheels with the simple syrup.', 'Fill the glass with ice and add the gin.', 'Top with a mixture of two parts cranberry juice to one part club soda.', 'Stir with a thyme sprig, leaving it in the glass, and garnish with three additional cranberries.']",14,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/garrick-club-punch/,Garrick Club Punch,David Wondrich,"One hot (well, hot for London, anyway) July afternoon in 1835, the English humorist Theodore Hook stepped into The Garrick Club. Not just anyone could do that, since The Garrick was (and still is) one of the city’s most exclusive clubs. Its members are a peculiar assortment of actors and such, and their patrons: the poor but amusing and the rich and aristocratic. Fortunately, Hook was the former. Now, according to a witness there that afternoon, Hook was “in that equivocal state of thirstiness which it requires something more than common to quench.” Also fortunately for Hook, The Garrick’s manager happened to be in the barroom at the time. Stephen Price was a New Yorker, a bit on the coarse side to be sure, but possessed with a little secret for making a truly quenching summer drink . (As any resident of the five boroughs knows, August in that city without the aid of such things is unendurable.) So Price set to ordering the Garrick’s barman to do this and that, and next thing Hook knew there was a jug in front of him. Gin punch. We can’t say exactly what his reaction was, but I suspect he was unimpressed. Englishmen had been drinking gin punch for a century—poor ones at first, then merchants and finally dukes and admirals. They knew the concoction as a simple mix of alcohol, sugar, lemon, water and a touch of spice. Nothing to it. But here’s where Price’s particular trick came into play. What if you sweetened the punch with some maraschino liqueur along with the sugar? And, more importantly, what if, instead of just plain water, you diluted it with chilled soda water? Hook had a sip. He finished the jug. “A second followed—a third, with the accompaniment of some chops—a fourth—a fifth—a sixth—at the expiration of which Mr. Hook went away to keep a dinner engagement at Lord Canterbury’s.” Let's hope he was a better guest than most people are after six preprandial punches.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/la-fleur-de-paradis/,Fleur de Paradis,Liquor.com,"A bright, floral and bubbly gin drink, the Fleur de Paradis comes from New York City bartending vet Kenta Goto. A lightly botanical gin, a floral liqueur, a mix of citrus juices and some bubbly wine all come together to evoke a paradise flower, the South African flower from which the drink gets its name. Though the cocktail is a little busy with seven ingredients, they’re fairly common ones. The Fleur de Paradis starts with Plymouth gin , a moderately priced dry gin that is well respected by bartenders for its nuanced botanicals. While it bears many similarities to London dry gins like Tanqueray, Beefeater or Bombay Sapphire, there are a few differences. Plymouth gin is less juniper-forward and also includes botanicals such as coriander, cardamom and angelica root, all of which give it an earthier tone. This distinction is important to the Fleur de Paradis, as swapping the gin for a more traditional London dry style will cause it to be a touch more bitter. St-Germain elderflower liqueur gives the drink most of its sweetness (which is enhanced with some simple syrup) as well as lovely overtones of white flowers. It pairs lovingly with the gin and grapefruit juice in the Fleur de Paradis, as well as the Champagne that finishes it. As with many other cocktails that call for Champagne—like the Mimosa or French 75 —that part is flexible. Goto uses Perrier-Jouët, a pricey and celebrated Champagne label, but if you’re not looking to splurge, another dry sparkling wine can fill in. However, stick to a white sparkling wine. Using a sparkling rosé will change the color of the drink from its namesake’s signature golden-orange hue. To complete the floral image and give the drink a touch of extra color, Goto garnishes it with an edible pansy, though doing so is not a required step.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Plymouth gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain elderflower liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Perrier-Jouët Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible pansy', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Plymouth gin, elderflower liqueur, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, simple syrup and orange bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a coupe glass.', 'Top with the Champagne.', 'Garnish with an edible pansy, if desired.']",14,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kew-garden/,Kew Garden,Alex Frane,"It’s hard to beat the refreshing quality of a minty, bubbly and boozy Mojito . This classic Cuban highball has been charming drinkers for decades, now, and is prime for reinterpretations, tweaks and other alterations . The Kew Garden is one such approach. Bartending icon and co-founder of bars like PDT in New York City and Takibi in Portland, Oregon, Jim Meehan developed the drink in homage to Banks 5-Island rum, the spirit’s namesake and the namesake’s co-creation of one of England’s famed botanical gardens. Banks 5-Island rum is named for the legendary British botanist Joseph Banks. Banks was an advisor to King George III in the later part of the 18th century, and accompanied the famous English sailor James Cook on his 1768 voyage across the Pacific to what would one day be named Australia and New Zealand. Later, Banks advised King George III on the creation of the Royal Botanical Garden, Kew , for which the drink is named. “This floral, savory Mojito variation was inspired by the royal botanical garden that Joseph Banks curated as an advisor to King George III,” says Meehan. Meehan developed the Kew Garden in 2010, coinciding with the release of Banks 5-Island. He says that while you could swap out the rum for another white rum, you’ll lose the connection to the names. The other element that connects it to the eponymous gardens is the addition of cucumber and St-Germain. Cucumber works beautifully in a drink like this, adding vegetal crispness and savoriness that makes it even more refreshing, like a cucumber water drink. Similarly, swapping some of the usual sugar for the sweet elderflower liqueur St-Germain adds a lovely floral element. Sipping the Kew Garden, you can almost feel yourself transported to a beautiful garden setting.

The punch begins with a lemon oleo saccharum , which sounds a lot more intimidating to make than it is. Essentially, you’re just muddling lemon peels with sugar and letting the combination sit. As the two ingredients mingle, the citrus oils leach into the sugar and you’re left with a rich, delicious syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/vertigo/,Vertigo,Liquor.com,"The Vertigo is a cocktail from San Francisco bartender Duggan McDonnell that skips a full-proof base spirit in favor of Averna, a member of the amaro category. The Italian word amaro translates to “bitter,” but the drink is a lot more multifaceted than its name suggests. It’s usually produced by macerating roots, herbs, bark, flowers and/or citrus peels in wine or neutral spirits, and then tweaked by adding sugar or aging in casks for more nuanced flavor. Averna dates back to 1868, when it was invented by Salvatore Averna in Sicily. It’s viscous and easy on the palate, which gives it lots of application in cocktails. It may be best know for its use in the Black Manhattan , a modern variation of the classic cocktail that subs in the amaro for sweet vermouth. To make the Vertigo, McDonnell goes the opposite route from the all-spirits Black Manhattan and pairs Averna with lemon juice in a highball glass, topping the duo with cold ginger ale. The simple cocktail is bittersweet, tart and refreshing, tasting more complex than its three ingredients would suggest. Amaro is traditionally consumed after a large meal to counter overindulgence, but you can drink it anytime the mood strikes. The Vertigo is no different.

But enterprising barkeeps are increasingly enlisting its services in cocktails, taking advantage of its yellow-orange hue and trademark flavor. Aida Ramirez, a former bartender at Decca in Louisville, Kentucky, crafted the Always Sunny, a summery, low-proof cocktail. Its base of ginger liqueur is accented by pisco, fresh lemon juice and turmeric simple syrup and finished with a splash of crisp prosecco. The King’s ginger liqueur is 82 proof, so this isn’t a low-ABV drink. It’s made with macerated ginger root and lemon oil, giving the liqueur a bright citrusy note that complements the ginger’s spicy bite. That liqueur merges deftly with a small measure of dry and fruity Peruvian pisco. The fresh lemon juice adds balance, while the turmeric-laced simple syrup—which is easy to make at home on the stove—brings earthy sweetness.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gibson/,Gibson,Kevin Gray,"There are limitless ways to tweak the classic Martini, including tried-and-true iterations like the 50/50 and Dirty Martini . But one of the best variations is also the easiest to make, simply calling for a specific garnish to differentiate it from all other Martinis. The Gibson is made with gin and dry vermouth and garnished with a pickled onion rather than an olive or lemon twist. It’s only a Gibson when that savory onion adorns the glass, adding its umami undertone to the classic cocktail. The origin behind this drink isn’t entirely clear, but it’s possible that the Gibson was created by San Francisco businessman Walter D.K. Gibson in the late 1800s at the Bohemian Club. The Gibson did first appear in print in the 1908 book, The World’s Drinks And How To Mix Them by William Boothby. However, at the time, the Gibson was more known for what it omitted than what it added—bitters. In the Martini’s early days, it was customary to add a dash or two of orange bitters to the cocktail, but the Gibson consciously skipped this ingredient. The now-signature cocktail onion didn’t become explicitly associated with the drink until years later. Gin is the traditional choice when making Gibsons, but as vodka usurped the gin’s botanical throne through the decades, vodka-laced Gibsons became common. You can choose whichever spirit you prefer. Gin lends more dry, bracing characteristics to the cocktail, while milder vodka takes a backseat to the other components. One way to really customize this three-part drink is by making your own pickled onions. A common practice in cocktail bars, it’s an easy endeavor. Most recipes simply call for soaking or cooking a handful of cocktail onions in a brine of vinegar, sugar, and pickling spices.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/vesper/,Vesper,Liquor.com,"The Vesper, also known as the Vesper Martini, was invented by author Ian Fleming for his iconic British secret agent, James Bond. The drink first appeared in Fleming's Casino Royale , which was published in 1953, the cocktail being named for the fictional double agent (and Bond love-interest) Vesper Lynd. When Bond orders his signature drink from the bartender, he provides strict instructions, which leaves little ambiguity in how to prepare the cocktail: “A dry martini. One. Three measures of Gordon’s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel.” While a general bartending rule of thumb is to always stir a spirit-only cocktail like a Martini , there's an argument to be made in support of (the now-iconic) shaking of a Vesper. Given that the drink contains four ounces of liquor, along with an extra half-ounce of Lillet, the drink is functionally a double. In order to make a palatable drink, the added water dilution from shaking can be preferable to that achieved by stirring. It may also serve a broader literary purpose of portraying Bond as a hard-drinking secret agent who chose to take his drinks exceedingly strong and shaken until they were so cold that the alcohol couldn't be felt as it went down. Bond claims that, when he’s concentrating, he never has more than one drink before dinner. But he likes that one drink to be very large. It’s easy to appreciate such a loophole. But if you want a less boozy drink, you can dial back the volume while keeping the proportions intact.

https://www.liquor.com/strawberry-margarita-cocktail-recipe-5192351,Strawberry Margarita,Liquor.com,"The classic Margarita , made by combining tequila , fresh lime juice, and triple sec or agave nectar, is one of the world’s most popular drinks for good reason—it’s easy to make and nicely balances zesty acid with spirit and sweetness. The simple, light, citrus-forward flavor profile of a classic Margarita also makes it an ideal canvas for experimentation with different flavor combinations. One of the most enduring of these variations? The iconic Strawberry Margarita. Why the Strawberry Margarita Works Bursting with summer flavor, the Strawberry Margarita works by bringing a component of red berry flavor to an otherwise acidic and citrus-heavy cocktail. Far beyond simply making a fruitier drink, the addition of strawberries helps to tamp down on the Margarita's naturally high citric acid content, by providing a balance of natural fruit sweetness rather than depending only on processed sugars in ingredients like triple sec. In short, by adding strawberries, you'll get is a brighter cocktail with balanced citrus-to-sweetness ratio, and flavor accents that can play across a wider range of the palate than a classic three-ingredient Margarita. Shaken or Blended Frozen? If you have access to a blender , this popular frozen cocktail couldn’t be easier to make. All the ingredients can be added directly to the blender with ice and pureed until slushy. Multiply the ingredients by the number of drinkers to whip up a crowd-pleasing batch . If a blender is not available, or if you're simply looking for a thinner texture, this Strawberry Margarita recipe also works well served on the rocks. Simply add the strawberries and agave nectar to a shaker tin and muddle together into a pulp-like consistency. Once you're finished, add everything else, plus ice, and shake.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rancors-toothpick/,Rancor’s Toothpick,Liquor.com,"When it comes to cultural touchstones, it’s hard to think of a piece of media with such profound, long-lasting influence as “Star Wars.” Since the film introduced us to Luke, Leia, Han Solo and Darth Vader in 1977, the Force can be found everywhere. The Rancor’s Toothpick is an example of the the way Star Wars can even show up in drinks. Named for the monstrous, toothy creature that Jabba the Hutt would feed his victims to in “Return of the Jedi” (no, not that toothy monster Jabba would feed his victims to, the other one), the drink was created by bartender Timothy Miner of New York City’s beloved Long Island Bar. Miner created the cocktail as a nod to his brother-in-law, who’s fond of giving family members disposition-appropriate “Star Wars” nicknames. “My brother-in-law Joey Carnevale is called The Rancor because he can be, well, unpredictable,” Miner says. “He’s also particularly fond of a well-mixed bourbon cocktail.” After all, a good cocktail can take you from cranky to calm in a sip, and Miner says that this one will do exactly that, even if you’re feeling as rattled as a gnarly-toothed Rancor. Essentially a take on the lush and boozy Boulevardier , the Rancor’s Toothpick substitutes Cynar for Campari. An herbaceous amaro, Cynar is made with artichoke, though the plant lends the cocktail subtle vegetal notes rather than overt artichoke flavors. For whiskey, Miner uses Old Forester Signature 100-proof bourbon, which is an excellent choice for the price point. The stronger proof works well in a drink with amaro and sweet vermouth, making a bold, yet balanced, cocktail. And while his brother-in-law may be a bourbon fan, there’s nothing wrong with substituting a rye whiskey. Rye’s inherent spice means you won’t need a higher-proof whiskey to compete with the assertive notes of sweet vermouth and Cynar. Either way, it’s a drink for those who like spirit-forward flavors. One major deviation from the Boulevardier recipe is the addition of bitters. Normally, the drink relies on Campari and vermouth to bring the bitters and botanicals, but the Rancor’s Toothpick gets an extra bite from smoky, chocolatey mole bitters. You could substitute Angostura bitters, if needed, but that will lead to more of a Wampa than a Rancor.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/scarlet-glow/,Scarlet Glow,Liquor.com,"“Tea’s fragrant aromas and varied flavors are the perfect accent to a revitalizing cocktail,” says bartender and distiller Allen Katz, who notes that the practice of combining tea and alcohol dates back at least to the expansion of colonial trade routes by European empires in the 17th century. He makes the Scarlet Glow with a hibiscus tea syrup, a combination of brewed hibiscus tea and granulated sugar that is made on the stove just like simple syrup . Katz says that making an infused syrup is one of the easiest ways to add tea’s flavors to a drink. “Bolder and brighter varieties like lavender, hibiscus and citrus will stand out best,” he says. “You then use the syrup to lightly sweeten a cocktail.” In this case, that syrup adds gently sweet floral notes to the complex mixture of pisco, yellow Chartreuse and grapefruit juice. Pisco is a grape-distilled spirit that was first made in the 16th century and is claimed as the national spirit of both Peru and Chile. Yellow Chartreuse has been made by Carthusian Monks since 1838 using a closely guarded recipe of 130 herbs, plants and flowers. With notes of honey, citrus, anise and saffron, it’s a little sweeter and softer than its green sibling . Grapefruit juice balances the potent spirits with a kick of tart citrus, and the tea creates the drink’s eye-catching red hue. “Tea cocktails marry two classic traditions and offer resounding stimulation, refreshment and humanity on any evening,” says Katz. 8 Tea Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pisco'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'yellow Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'hibiscus tea syrup'}]","['Add the pisco, yellow Chartreuse, grapefruit juice and hibiscus tea syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.']",6,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/master-cleanse/,Master Cleanse Shot,Liquor.com,"The Master Cleanse is a diet fad that was first proposed in 1941 but reached peak popularity in the early 2000s. The cleanse is essentially a crash diet meant to detoxify your body that involves drinking a special elixir multiple times per day. That elixir consists of fresh lemon juice, organic maple syrup, cayenne pepper and water. Its health claims are dubious, at best, so we can’t recommend you follow suit. But we can suggest a cocktail recipe that pays homage to the cleanse, no diet required. The Master Cleanse Shot recipe comes from Jordan Mackay, a Northern California-based writer and the author of numerous books. He maintains the core tenets of the original concoction by using fresh lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper (plus the water produced from shaking with ice), but he swerves from the path with pisco and a dash of chili powder. Pisco is a grape-distilled spirit that hails from Peru and Chile, was first made in the 16th century, and is best known for its starring role in the Pisco Sour . In this recipe, it provides a spiritous base for the sweet, sour and spice components of the other ingredients. Depending which style of pisco you choose, that base can be dry and earthy or fruity and floral. The recipe makes two servings, so you can toast with a friend before sending this shot down the hatch.

For proof, look to the Chicken & Apple Wassail, an elegant chilled cocktail by Christy Pope of consulting and catering company Cuffs & Buttons and Dallas cocktail bar Midnight Rambler . “Stock-tails,” as they are often called, may seem avant-garde or even strange, but using broth in cocktails is nothing groundbreaking. “Stock-tails are not new,” says Pope. “Classic cocktails like the Bull Shot show historic precedent.” At Midnight Rambler, she began serving the Pho-King Champ stock-tail (wheat vodka, oloroso sherry, aromatized beef stock and cilantro) when the bar opened in 2014, attributing the recent rise in popularity of stock-tails to the current interest in the health benefits of bone broths. When creating stock-tails of your own, remember that broth acts as a diluent, albeit a flavorful one, so be sure not to over dilute your cocktail when shaking or stirring. If you want to go all-in, make the broth at home. Otherwise, you can purchase a quality option at the store. From there, anything is possible. “Broths play well with most spirits, both neutral and aromatic,” says Pope.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/alaska/,Alaska,Liquor.com,"Crisp, botanical, bracing, bold—all of these are terms that can be used to described the Alaska. A close relative of the Martini, the Alaska was developed in the early 1900s, though the origin of its name remains a mystery. Originally, the recipe called for Old Tom Gin, a sweeter, barrel-aged gin historically used in the Martinez . By the Alaska’s publication in “The Savoy Cocktail Book” in 1930, however, the Old Tom was replaced with a London dry gin, and has remained so since. “It dances between spirit-driven and citrus-forward,” says bartender Keli Rivers, formerly of San Francisco's Whitechapel, a temple of gin and gin cocktails. “It’s good, moving from one side of the spectrum to the other.” Like a Martini, the Alaska is a straightforward drink to construct, with only gin, yellow Chartreuse and a dash of bitters needed. However, each ingredient is a potent elixir on its own. Yellow Chartreuse is less commonly used in cocktails than its green brethren , and is sweeter and a bit less botanical, though still a deeply herbaceous spirit. Orange bitters add further complexity and botanical notes, as well as a bit of aromatic citrus that is amplified by the lemon zest garnish. This simplicity in execution, though, means that the gin choice for the drink is crucial. This is not a cocktail where a bottom shelf brand can slip by unnoticed. And while the “best” gin for the drink is up to your personal taste preferences, the overt botanical nature of the yellow Chartreuse means a cleaner, more juniper-focused gin is a good pick.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'yellow Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, yellow Chartreuse and orange bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass.', 'Express the oil of a lemon twist over the drink and then garnish the drink with the twist.']",45,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/flying-dutchman/,Flying Dutchman,Liquor.com,"Before gin, there was genever. Hailing from the Netherlands, this grain spirit dates back to the 16th century. It still holds immense sway in bars across Holland, as well as Belgium and other select European countries. But it wasn’t until the late-aughts that genever found its way to U.S. soil with the launch of Bols genever. Given its malty and herbal flavor, genever is versatile and can be worked into traditional gin cocktails like the Tom Collins , as well as classic whiskey cocktails and modern creations. Spirits industry veteran Brian MacGregor created the Flying Dutchman when he was bartending at Jardinière in San Francisco. He enlists genever, two French liqueurs (yellow Chartreuse and Benedictine ) and lemon juice for this cocktail, which sports a complexity that belies its simple construction. Yellow Chartreuse has been made by Carthusian Monks since 1840. The closely guarded recipe features 130 herbs, plants and flowers, and the 86-proof final product has notes of honey, citrus, anise and saffron. Benedictine is an 80-proof cognac-based liqueur that is also made from a secret recipe. It contains 27 herbs and spices, including saffron, cinnamon, fir cones and juniper, and is then aged and finished with honey before bottling. It’s sweet, floral and herbaceous, with notes of baking spices, honey and orange peel. You’re off to a strong start, but you’re not done yet. Fresh lemon juice tempers the sweet liqueurs with its trademark tartness, bringing balance to the cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/magic-hour/,Magic Hour,Liquor.com,"The Magic Hour is a fizzy aperitif from bartender Tom Macy, who created the recipe for the Clover Club in Brooklyn. It quickly became one of the bar’s most popular drinks, and it’s easy to see why—the cocktail is light, tart and bubbly, and it looks great in the glass. To make the Magic Hour, Macy skips a full-strength base spirit and instead enlists the charms of Lillet Rosé, an aromatized wine from France with notes of berries, orange blossom and grapefruit. He joins that with yellow Chartreuse, a French liqueur that’s been made by Carthusian Monks since 1838 from a secret recipe of 130 herbs, plants and flowers. At just a teaspoon, the Chartreuse presence is subtle, but enough to impart its trademark notes of honey, citrus, anise and saffron. Macy adds fresh grapefruit juice and simple syrup, and after shaking the whole affair with ice, he tops it with chilled sparkling wine, which is always a fine and festive choice. Since the Magic Hour is relatively low proof , you can have a couple before dinner without missing your reservation. However, should you care to fortify your drink with a little something stronger, Macy suggests adding a half ounce of gin.

One of the easiest and most popular ways to tweak the Italian classic is by simply substituting the primary spirit: Swap out the gin for whiskey and you have a Boulevardier or use a Jamaican rum like Smith & Cross to make the Kingston Negroni . One curious addition to the Negroni variation roster is made with a spirit that many Americans may not be familiar with: the Bagrationi uses chacha, the signature spirit of the country of Georgia , as its base. 11 Negroni Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE If you’re a drinker visiting the Eastern European country of Georgia, chances are you’ve thrown back a shot of this clear brandy made from pomace, the pulpy remains of wine grapes after they’ve been pressed for their juices. An infamously strong spirit, chacha is ubiquitous in Georgia, a fundamental piece of the country's hospitality, celebrations and culinary traditions. And while it’s not so big in the United States (most bartenders would like have only a passing familiarity, if any), bartenders in Georgia are now deploying it in a wide range of cocktails. One of the bars at the forefront of the movement, a bar that is helping to elevate the cocktail scene in the capital city of Tbilisi, is 41 Gradus . 41 Gradus uses the spirit in many of its cocktails, including riffs on classics. Bar owner Roman Milostivy employs it in place of the usual gin in the Bagrationi, named for Pyotr Bagration, a Russian general and native Georgian who fought against Napoleon in 1812 and was mortally wounded for his efforts. The other parts, Campari and Italian sweet vermouth, he keeps as is. The result is something like a Vodka Negroni, only brighter and richer. However, chacha is rarely available in the United States and even other countries like the United Kingdom.

Today, the classic remains a steady figure on menus, but over the years, creative barkeeps and home bartenders have tweaked the recipe to make myriad variations. Most swap the base spirit or replace Campari with another bitter liqueur, but some turn the drink on its head entirely. The Negroni Sorbet is a perfect example, especially because it’s not a drink at all, but a frozen treat that you eat with a spoon. The recipe comes from Steven Canfield at Boxes and Booze . First up, you need an ice cream maker. Once that’s acquired, the process is easy: You simply combine gin, Campari and sweet vermouth with ruby red grapefruit juice, sugar and water, and let the ice cream maker do its thing. Freeze the result for a couple hours, then it’s ready to eat.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sotolero/,Sotolero,Liquor.com,"Tequila and mezcal get most of the attention when talking about Mexican spirits, but the diverse country produces a handful of other liquors that also deserve attention, including sotol. This earthy spirit is distilled from the desert spoon plant that grows wild in Mexico, as well as in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Though it still lags far behind tequila and mezcal, today sotol is becoming a more regular presence on bar menus and in cocktails. The Sotolero comes from San Francisco bartender Candice Jae. She created the cocktail during her time at Mosto , a bar boasting more than 200 tequilas, 200 mezcals and even a vegan pechuga mezcal flight. The all-spirits Sotolero drinks like a Martini , but by swapping out gin for sotol its flavors are green and earthy. Lillet blanc aperitif plays the part of dry vermouth in this Martini riff, while Salers aperitif lends gentian qualities to ramp up the herbal notes. Orange bitters add complexity and a citrus accent, which are furthered by a spritz of lemon peel oil. Finally, Jae garnishes the drink with dill, which brings a fresh, green note to the aroma and palate. The Sotolero is a fun departure from the typical sotol cocktail, which often hews toward the Margarita in style and flavor.

Paylor bolsters the ingredient with brewed green tea. “I love using green tea in my beverages,” she says. “The tannins and herbaceous elements work beautifully in a range of beverages from a spritz or highball to an Old Fashioned.” When brewing the tea, allow it to steep longer to produce a stronger drink that can stand up to other ingredients, and cool to room temperature before using.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/shirley-temple/,Shirley Temple,Liquor.com,"The Shirley Temple is probably the most famous mocktail ever. This classic mix of ginger ale and grenadine with a squeeze of lemon or lime topped with maraschino cherries is believed to be the world’s first mocktail. And it’s still alive and well today. The drink is named for Shirley Temple, the child actress, singer and dancer who starred in many movies and television shows during the 1930s and ’40s and later become a U.S. diplomat and ambassador. It’s possible the drink debuted at the Brown Derby restaurant in Los Angeles—a claim made by Ms. Temple herself—although other establishments also lay claim to the beverage’s provenance. Often viewed as a child’s drink, the Shirley Temple is a popular choice for anyone seeking a tasty nonalcoholic beverage. That’s why the Shirley Temple is a fixture at bars, whether it’s on the official mocktail menu or not. Of course, like all drinks, the quality can vary. Make your Shirley Temple with cheap bottled grenadine, sweet-and-sour and neon-red maraschino cherries, and you’re bound to create a sickly sweet concoction that belongs squarely on the kid’s menu. But use homemade grenadine , fresh citrus, and garnish it with high-quality cherries, and you’ll have a well-made example fit for discerning drinkers. Over the years, bartenders have found ways to tweak the Shirley Temple recipe. Some replace the ginger ale with ginger syrup and club soda, while others skip the ginger entirely and opt for lemon-lime soda or lemonade. You can also make this mocktail a cocktail, often dubbed the Dirty Shirley, by dosing it with vodka or another spirit of your choice. Regardless of which route you choose to go, the drink has staying power. It’s the familiarity and ease of order that are the keys to the Shirley Temple’s longevity. Ms. Temple herself, however, was not a fan of the drink. She thought it was too sweet. But perhaps even she would have enjoyed the popular elixir if she’d tried this recipe, which features good grenadine, fresh lime juice and good cherries.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bamboo/,Bamboo,Kevin Gray,"Building cocktails gives the bartender—including those who ply their trade at home—endless opportunities to experiment with spirits, modifiers and mixers. Full-proof liquors like whiskey, gin, vodka, tequila, rum and brandy get most of the love, providing the base for classic and modern drinks. But your cocktails don’t always require such a boozy backbone. You can also make lower-proof ingredients like vermouth and sherry the star of the show. Sherry cocktails in particular have seen a lot of interest over the past few years, with the bartender community gravitating toward the underrated fortified wine, mixing together classics like the Sherry Cobbler and Bamboo. The latter is a 19th-century cocktail that is as easy to drink as it is to assemble—stir everything with ice, strain it all into a coupe and garnish with a lemon twist. The Bamboo calls for equal measures of dry vermouth and dry sherry, plus a couple dashes of bitters. Fino sherry is a popular choice for the drink, so that’s a great place to start. It’s light and delicate, often with notes of almonds, and it pairs wonderfully with food. Merge it with dry vermouth, and the combination of the two fortified wines creates a floral, herbal and complex cocktail that you can sip all day long without falling off your barstool. 9 Low-Proof Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry sherry'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dry sherry, dry vermouth, Angostura bitters and orange bitters into a mixing glass with cracked ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe, and garnish with a lemon twist.']",28,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sherry-cobbler/,Sherry Cobbler,David Wondrich,"The last 150 years have brought us many excellent things with which to while away the idle hours: recorded music, motion pictures, Twitter, video games, the drama-rich doings of the celebrity du jour. We’ve got air conditioning now, which–although it cuts down on one traditional recreation, cursing bitterly at the weather—has made life indoors more tolerable. For those of us whose recreation includes savoring an alcoholic beverage, that century-and-a-half has also supplied such innovations as the Martini and Piña Colada . We’ve lost a few things, too, and I’m not referring to dignity and literacy. (I’m a drink writer and we don’t talk about that kind of stuff.) In this case, I mean the Sherry Cobbler. It’s not a particularly amusing name for a drink, but beggars can’t be choosers, especially not sweltering ones. People back in the 1830s, when the Cobbler first turned up, didn’t have air conditioning, or even Vornado fans. This drink was all they had when the weather turned repulsive (well, OK, they had it and the Mint Julep ). While we like to think that back then, before there were cars and traffic lights and iWhatnots, you could be as drunk as a boiled owl and still go about your day, there were a few poor souls who couldn’t. For them, since there’s nothing more endrunkening than a Julep, there was the Cobbler. A good-sized splash of sherry, which has all the flavor of booze but less than half the horsepower, a little sugar and a slice or two of orange, shaken with ice like the Devil himself was whipping you on. Serve with a straw, if you like. (It was probably the Sherry Cobbler that got us using those suckers in the first place.) Nothing more refreshing has ever been created.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brillig-rosemary-pomegranate-soda/,Rosemary-Pomegranate Soda,Liquor.com,"There are plenty of good reasons not to drink alcohol—health concerns, social obligations and financial limitations are all compelling reasons to avoid the hard stuff. And, really, no one requires a reason to choose not to drink alcohol. However, avoiding consumption can bring up its own complications, and one of those is a lack of enjoyable beverages to replace the ones made with booze. While alcohol has its many downsides, a cocktail is a special thing, and its complexities and flavors can be difficult to replicate in zero-proof form. Luckily, bartenders these days are more aware of guests’ desire to have low and no-proof cocktails on the menu. One such person is Nic Sims, a former chef and bartender who created the Rosemary-Pomegranate Soda as an alternative to boozier highballs. His creation is a complex and delicious drink that is easy to prepare at home. Juicy, rich and crimson with the right balance of sweetness, earthiness and tartness, pomegranate juice is an excellent base for a non-alcoholic drink. Normally, the drink calls for an ounce of the homemade rosemary simple syrup, but you can adjust proportions for your preferred level of sweetness. Add extra pomegranate juice to up the tartness and juiciness, or simply cut back the simple syrup for drier beverage. Rosemary is the perfect herb to infuse in the sugar syrup for this drink, but it can be fun to experiment with other fresh herbs. Thyme, basil, mint, sage and lavender all make lovely syrups. But not all of them go well with pomegranate juice. So it’s best to mix and match to determine which herbs do, and which would go better with citrus or plain club soda. Furthermore, while the recipe for rosemary simple syrup uses brown sugar, other herbs might fare better when paired with white cane sugar or even honey or agave. If you do choose to imbibe spirits, the rosemary simple syrup will serve well in other drinks, such as the Rosemary Paloma .","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pomegranate juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rosemary simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'rosemary sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a Collins glass one-third of the way with ice.', 'Add the pomegranate juice and rosemary simple syrup.', 'Fill the glass to the rim with club soda and stir gently.', 'Garnish with a rosemary sprig and serve.']",8,

Believed to be the world’s first mocktail, the Shirley Temple is still a popular order today, but at most bars it’s an afterthought, served with soda-gun ginger ale and garnished with bright-red, preservative-laden cherries. Fortunately, some barkeeps choose to give the drink the same thoughtful treatment they give cocktails. Colleen Kenny, the bar manager of Nostrana in Portland, Oregon, serves customers her version of the Shirley Temple when they want something that’s nonalcoholic but still interesting. The Don’t Call Me Shirley features housemade grenadine, fresh lemon and lime juice, club soda and amarena cherries. It skips the ginger ale, resulting in a drink that’s less sweet than the original, but still has plenty of effervescence and flavor. “It’s a fun way to let them drink something that’s special when they’re eating out,” she says. “I drank them all the time when eating out with my parents. It’s always consistent. We call ours Don’t Call Me Shirley because you’re not getting the scary, cloying syrup that people are used to.” The Shirley Temple is often viewed as a child’s drink, but you don’t have to be a kid to want a tasty nonalcoholic beverage. That’s why the Shirley Temple remains a fixture at bars, whether it’s featured on the menu or made on-the-spot for guests who ask for it.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/strawberry-crush/,Strawberry Crush,Liquor.com,"When it comes to non-alcoholic drinks , options are often limited to beverages like bitters and soda, or maybe a fruit juice of some kind. But those who are choosing to abstain for any reason and for any amount of time deserve a product that’s as delicious and thoughtfully constructed as any alcoholic drink. Bartender Sean Barlow’s Strawberry Crush is one such alcohol-free libation, a fruity yet nuanced concoction that’s pleasing enough that you won’t even want to add liquor (though you could). One taste will take the Strawberry Crush and develop it until a full blown love affair. The Strawberry Crush starts with muddled strawberries. The process itself is simple, but sourcing the best ingredients can be a challenge. While global markets mean strawberries are in grocery stores year-round, the ripest and most flavorful strawberries will always be those found locally in summer. Because of this, the Strawberry Crush is best enjoyed during the hotter seasons. Besides berries, the Strawberry Crush also calls for a few sprigs of mint. Like the strawberries, these will be best in summertime when mint is plentiful, though the herb grows nearly year-round in some climates. Lime juice adds tartness and brightness, while simple syrup balances that and helps coax out the berries’ sweetness. The recipe calls for one ounce of simple syrup, but that might need to be altered depending on the sweetness of the fruit and the amount of juice given by the lime. Finally, the drink is topped with ginger beer for carbonation, spice and depth. You can use a ginger ale, but that runs the risk of being overly sweet. The natural pepperiness of ginger beer will lead to a more balanced and nuanced beverage. The whole point of the Strawberry Crush is that it’s completely enjoyable as is, with no need for spirits. However, if you need to give the drink a kick, it’s remarkably flexible in what liquors work well. Add a white rum and it becomes a gingery take on a Mojito , while a blackstrap rum makes it more like a variation on a Dark ’n Stormy . Tequila pairs lovingly with the strawberry and lime, and bourbon will lead to a perfect warm-weather highball. And if you’re looking for a boost without overly changing the drink’s flavor profile, vodka is your friend.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/maple-beet-shrub/,Maple Beet Shrub,Liquor.com,"While shrubs have been around for hundreds of years, if not longer, their presence in cocktails is a relatively new phenomenon for modern bartenders. Shrubs are, essentially, a potable vinegar, and are a terrific addition to a drink because of the complexity they bring, including a good balance of sweetness and acid. What is beautiful about shrubs is that there are only two rules: something sweet and something acidic. From there, your imagination can run wild. Typically some variety of sugar does the heavy lifting, but maple syrup offers a perfect hit of character and complexity in this recipe from Casey Elsass, the founder of Bushwick Kitchen , a company that produces hot sauces, maple syrup and honey. And although the beets maybe seem like an odd or unnecessary addition, they actually keep the sweetness in check with a welcome earthiness. Similarly, mustard seed may seem an unorthodox ingredient, but the flavor is subtle and adds tang and richness. Once your shrub is ready (the longer you let it sit, the better), it’s a fantastic mixer in a variety of cocktails, including these three favorites: the Shrub Julep , the Shrubarita and the G.C.S . Adding a splash to a sparkling wine of your choice or substituting the Maple Beet Shrub for simple syrup in drinks like a Bourbon Old Fashioned can also work well. Really, it’s best to play around, trying what works, what doesn’t and what is surprisingly good with a bit of earthy shrub. The other benefit of shrubs is that they can also be used to make an excellent non-alcoholic drink that isn’t just another juice or sugary soda. The easiest way to serve a booze-free drink with shrubs is by simply mixing them with club soda and letting their natural flavors shine.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/plomeek-tea/,Plomeek Tea,Liquor.com,"As far as science fiction on television is concerned, no franchise is as immediately recognizable and embedded in our cultural awareness as “Star Trek” is. The space-faring shows span decades, and has included a number of different fictional drinks . But whereas the setting’s militaristic Cardassians had their Kanar , and the nefarious Romulans their blue-hued Romulan Ale , the latter’s sibling race, the Vulcans, had no such canonical alcoholic beverage. We can assume that the stoic Vulcan people are not huge fans of intoxicants—such indulgences would be illogical, as they hinder the control and balance of one’s emotions. However, there is a reference to a tea that is made from Plomeek, some sort of fruit or flower that is also used to make soup. While the beverage was never directly mentioned on any of the Star Trek shows, some eagle-eyed viewers managed to find a reference to it on a menu displayed in an episode of “Star Trek: Enterprise.” Since we don’t have access to the planet Vulcan’s agriculture (yet), this drink from bartender, writer and consultant John deBary is an approximation, made with three different kinds of tea and tisanes: a bright green sencha for vegetal notes and antioxidants, a licorice tisane for some depth and earthiness, and a hibiscus tisane for bright tartness and vivid red hues. The Plomeek Tea also calls for verjus blanc. Verjus refers to the unfermented juice made from wine grapes. This non-alcoholic “wine” has seen an increased appreciation by bartenders in recent years for its tart, unique profile. At times it’s used to replace citrus in a cocktail, and for this drink it essentially takes the place of the lemon traditionally included in iced tea. However it brings its own depth and complexity, and the varietal of grape used in the verjus can have dramatic impacts on the flavor profile. The Vulcan-inspired tea uses a verjus blanc, or one made from white wine grapes like pinot blanc, chardonnay, or gewürztraminer. Verjus can be difficult to find in most stores. If pressed, lemon juice or another citrus can stand in for it, but it will not bring the same unique complexity that verjus does. Luckily, these days there are more bottled verjus on the market, and they can sometimes be found in speciality stores, gourmet grocery stores and, of course, in online markets. 5 'Star Trek' Cocktails to Try Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'tea'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'licorice root tea'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'hibiscus tea'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'verjus blanc'}]","['Add the sencha, licorice root and hibiscus teas to a large mug, and bring water to a lightly rolling boil.

In case you’d like to branch out beyond this one, look to dark spirits. “I tend to use this syrup in riffs on whiskey-based classic cocktails, particularly Irish whiskey and Japanese whisky but also bourbon,” says Marrero.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smoke-break/,Smoke Break,Liquor.com,"There are several ways to add smoky flavors to cocktails. Start with a base of smoky mezcal or peaty scotch , and you’re off to a good start. But if you really want to bring smoke to the party, try a cocktail smoker . These contraptions heat wood chips and provide a targeted stream of smoke directly into a glass or decanter where it can merge with the liquid components of your drink. Los Angeles bartender Jake Larowe takes this route with the Smoke Break. He says he wanted to create a decadent Manhattan riff with a playful accent. That playfulness begins with the ingredients, which include bourbon, cream sherry, sweet vermouth and two types of bitters. But it’s the smoking gun that steals the show. Larowe smokes cherrywood chips, letting the rich smoke mingle with the cocktail in a sealed vessel before the contents are poured into a rocks glass over a large ice cube. The drink is fun, delicious and visually appealing. The result reminds him of waiting tables in college and taking a quick cigarette break outside after the rush is over. “We wanted to create the cocktail that you look forward to after a long day at work,” he says. 9 Perfectly Smoky Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'cherrywood\xa0chips'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cream sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vermouth'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dark chocolate', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dried black cherries', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Using a smoking gun and the cherrywood chips, add smoke to a glass decanter, then cover the top of the decanter to capture the smoke.', 'Add the bourbon, cream sherry, vermouth, both bitters and ice into a mixing glass, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain the contents into the prepared decanter, then cap the decanter so the drink mingles with the smoke.

https://www.liquor.com/switchel-cocktail-recipe-4798101,Switchel,Kelly Magyarics,"The switchel is thought to have originated in the Caribbean and became popular among British colonists during 17th-century New England. It typically contained apple cider vinegar, ginger and a sweetener, and today, as with the popularity of shrubs and kombucha, the switchel has made a comeback. Kevin Murphy, the bar director and assistant manager at Daisies, an American restaurant in Chicago, praises switchels for their health benefits. “Switchels are an effective electrolyte-replenishing beverage,” he says. “Ingredients like honey, vinegar, molasses and ginger, along with other herbs and sweeteners, were commonly used; many are still prized for their nutritional value.” When he found that he was disappointed in the flavor of many commercially available varieties, he decided to create his own, using apple cider vinegar mixed with honey syrup and topped with sparkling water. He even uses a homemade apple cider vinegar, but a high-quality organic commercial brand works equally well. The spirit is optional, but if you do turn it into a cocktail, Murphy recommends adding no more than an ounce of booze to keep the flavor balanced. Using restraint here also keeps the focus on the drink’s healthy properties, rather than its intoxicating effects. If you do choose to spike your switchel, for good results, try bourbon, white or aged rum, blended scotch, oloroso sherry or Amaro Montenegro.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-root-beer/,Bourbon & Root Beer,Kate Willsky,"Bourbon and cola is classic. Bourbon and ginger ale: same deal. But bourbon and root beer does not receive the attention it deserves. The fizzy soda’s distinctive bite, imparted by sassafras root, helps dampen bourbon’s sweetness, while the soda’s earthy notes bring out more nuanced aromas. There’s a hint of anise as well, reminiscent of a Sazerac , and a strong vanilla flavor that gives it all a lovely creaminess. Considering root beer’s history, it is a natural addition to spirits. The method of brewing root beer evolved out of the tradition of small beer—low-ABV brews that offered a less perilous alternative to the contaminated water of Medieval Europe but wouldn’t leave its imbibers sloshed. (Early root beers were at least 2% alcoholic.) A teetotaler produced the first commercial root beer, and then there was Prohibition, and thus root beer became, definitively, a soft drink. Around the country, bartenders are beginning to tap into root beer’s unrealized potential. “Root beer is an amazing mixer!” says Juyoung Kang, the lead bartender of The Dorsey at The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas. She praises the “great baking spice notes” that echo and enhance the flavors imparted by whiskey barrels. Kristin Lozano, a bartender and consultant in Northern California, says that root beer is the perfect match for whiskey, especially a high-proof bourbon. And Nashville bartender Jonathan Howard also finds root beer superior to more conventional whiskey accompaniments. “Drinks with root beer have far more complexity and richness than just using a common mixer like ginger ale,” he says, citing root beer’s herbaceous quality, vanilla notes and unique viscosity. These bartenders all use craft root beer for their cocktails and emphasize the importance of choosing one that’s as high-caliber as the whiskey in question. Still, root beer isn’t as ubiquitous as it should be, so give this recipe a try if you can’t find a root beer cocktail near you. If you love it, join the charge in asking bartenders for bourbon with root beer until it becomes a common option. They’ll only look at you weird until they try it themselves. Forget Ginger Ale.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/peach-me/,Peach Me,Kelly Magyarics,"Overly sweet drinks with silly names—that’s pretty much the reputation peach schnapps has garnered since it was first used during the dark ages of the cocktail. (In the 1988 flair bartending film “Cocktail,” Tom Cruise’s character pays a now-cringeworthy poetic homage: “The Sex on the Beach, the schnapps made of peach.”) If your tastes have evolved beyond the treacly flavor of a Fuzzy Navel but you still have the remnants of a bottle, pry open the cap glued shut from sugar and try the liqueur in modern bartending. A big misconception is that peach schnapps needs to always be used in sweet sips or to introduce newbies to the cocktail category. That doesn’t have to be so, as Jason Shullo, the beverage director for Golden Entertainment, which operates casinos and resorts in Nevada and Maryland, explains. “You can overcome this stigma by using small amounts of it in craft cocktails to balance smoky flavors and enhance the peach taste,” he says. “Peach goes well with orange, ginger and vanilla to complement these flavors and bring out the fruitiness.” According to Shullo, peach schnapps works well in bourbon-based drinks like Smashes , Cobblers or Julep. In his nuanced version of an Old Fashioned , the bourbon accentuates the liqueur’s peach notes and bitters temper its sweetness. Shullo uses Woodford Reserve in his recipe, a high quality, well-regarded small-batch bourbon from Kentucky. With two and a half ounces in the drink, it creates a bold, assertive Old Fashioned, with the peach schnapps acting as an enhancement more than a center stage player. Given its sweetness, the schnapps also stands in for the usual simple syrup. To further enhance the fruit, this Old Fashioned gets the Wisconsin treatment : muddled orange and cherry in the glass, like all Old Fashioneds did in the 1980s and ’90s. But it’s important to use a top-tier cherry like a Luxardo maraschino cherry rather than one of those electric red artificial cherries that top a Shirley Temple.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-rickey/,Bourbon Rickey,Kevin Gray,"There are many measures for leaving your mark on this world. Some are subjective, but others—like changing history to the point that a monument is named after you—are undeniable. Colonel Joe Rickey didn’t get a monument in his hometown of Washington, D.C., but he did receive a cocktail. And, as far as drinking legend is concerned, that’s just as good. The Bourbon Rickey is a highball that was named for the Democratic lobbyist, who lived in the nation’s capital during the late 19th century. As the story goes, he was known to partake in beverages at Shoomaker’s bar. And, as Mr. Rickey favored drinks with zero sugar, he often requested a simple combination of bourbon and sparkling water. It’s easy to see how this simple duo could provide refreshment during the pre-A/C days of wearing suits all summer long. One day, the bartender, a helpful chap named George Williamson, added freshly squeezed lime to the highball, and the Bourbon Rickey was born. The serendipitous trio walks the line between a Whiskey Sour (whiskey, citrus, sugar) and a Whiskey Collins (whiskey, citrus, sugar, sparkling water). It’s tart, dry, thirst-quenching and surprisingly balanced, even without a dose of sugar to tame the other ingredients. If you’re making one at home, choose your preferred bourbon for mixing. Fresh lime is nonnegotiable, and a good bottle of sparkling water will give the drink the proper bubbly bite. The Bourbon Rickey is a historical drink to be sure, but the Rickey didn’t reach widespread appeal until the 1890s, when it was more commonly made with gin. That trend continued, and even today, the Gin Rickey is much better known among barkeeps and consumers. But let’s never forget its bourbon-spiked predecessor, which is not a riff, but the original. It’s said that Joe Rickey grew weary of his cocktail outshining his political achievements. So, the next time you raise a Bourbon Rickey to your lips, remember the eponymous lobbyist behind it. And then maybe Google his achievements. 20 Bourbon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Sparkling water'}]","['Fill a highball glass with ice.', 'Squeeze the lime half into the glass and drop it in.', 'Add the bourbon and fill with sparkling water.', 'Stir briefly to combine.']",126,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/revenant/,Revenant,Liquor.com,"John Filkins, the beverage director at Officina and Masseria in Washington, D.C., wanted to create a richer version of a Boulevardier , including adding a whiff of smoke. The Revenant was the outcome. Its name means “the returned,” usually in the context of returning from the dead, and it includes an unconventional form of smoke. Rather than using an exceptionally peaty scotch or adding a mezcal float, he instead boils Fee Brothers Aztec chocolate bitters and cardamom bitters. Since the bitters are both glycerin-based they smoke rather than burning the way those made from alcohol would. Filkins uses a Turkish coffee pot—also known as an ibrik or cezve—whose high heat tolerance means it nearly instantaneously smokes the bitters when they hit the hot surface. To capture the smoke, invert a snifter over the hot pot until it’s filled, then quickly place a coaster over the mouth of the glass to seal it. At Officina and Masseria, bartenders or servers will bring the glass to the table and pour the drink from a carafe over the smoke, bringing spectacle to the service. “The smoke adds a wow factor when it goes to the table, and chocolate and cardamom bring aromatic complexity and warm baking spices,” Filkins says. While the Revenant is based on the Boulevardier (a whiskey-based variation on the Negroni ), it uses neither Campari nor vermouth. Instead, vermouth is replaced by Chinato, a fortified and aromatized wine that is flavored with quinine, the same ingredient that gives tonic water its telltale bitterness. That quinine is necessary for balance, as the Revenant substitutes dry curaçao, an orange liqueur, for the usual Campari that would lend the drink bitterness. “Chinato is a great replacement for vermouth and adds an herbal complexity, [while] dry curaçao helps to lift it,” says Filkins.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Fee Brothers Aztec chocolate bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Fee Brothers cardamom bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Blanton’s\xa0bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cocchi Barolo chinato'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Pierre Ferrand dry curaçao'}]","['Heat an empty Turkish coffeepot.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/diy-southern-comfort/,DIY Southern Comfort,Liquor.com,"Though at times dismissed as a party liquor enjoyed only by college students and Janis Joplin fans, Southern Comfort has a long and venerable history , which is described in “ The Bourbon Bartender .” Written by New York City bartenders Jane Danger and Alla Lapushchik, the book celebrates America’s signature spirit and the drinks made with it, including Southern Comfort. The controversial liquor’s origins date back to the late 19th century, when it was first sold in New Orleans’ French Quarter as bourbon flavored with honey, citrus and spice. Originally called Cuffs & Buttons, it wouldn’t receive the name Southern Comfort until a few years after its creation. Like many other American spirits, Southern Comfort mostly disappeared during Prohibition, but it returned to shelves soon after repeal. But at some point over the decades it was no longer made with whiskey, but rather with some form of liqueur. The exact details are still unclear, but it was likely a neutral grain spirit that was vaguely whiskey-flavored and imbued with fruits and spices. In 2016, Sazerac Company bought the Southern Comfort brand from Brown-Forman Corporation, and a year later announced it would return the spirit to its whiskey-based origins. It’s still not clear what kind of whiskey the company uses in the creation of Southern Comfort or its new expressions, including a 100-proof label and a black label with a new proprietary blend. If you want a particular bourbon base, or rye or any other kind of whiskey, it’s best to make it yourself. Luckily, it’s not that hard to do, as all it requires is some choice fruits and spices, as well as five to seven days of aging. Using a higher-proof bourbon (or another whiskey) will hasten the process somewhat, but to speed the process up to a few hours, you can always infuse it using sous vide .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/holy-smokes/,Holy Smokes,Liquor.com,"Those who love rich, dark and botanical-heavy drinks will likely appreciate the Holy Smokes, a cocktail by bartender and spirits representative Tony Devencenzi. While at its base it resembles the spirit-forward Manhattan , its ingredients offer a more robust, layered experience overall. The Holy Smokes is fairly specific about many of its ingredients, but one area where it is not is the base spirit, other than it calls for bourbon. With countless bourbons on the market, from rye heavy ones to wheated, bottled-in-bond to barrel proof, you’ve got plenty of room here to play. Any bottling you prefer to use in a Manhattan or even Old Fashioned will work, especially as the Holy Smokes is accompanied by some pretty bold liqueurs. Think of the bourbon as the backdrop for the drink, so a bourbon that is assertive but not overpowering will be best. However, unlike a Manhattan which calls for sweet vermouth, the Holy Smokes calls for an equal-parts mix of Cardamaro vino amaro and Benedictine . The first is a wine-based liqueur flavored with numerous botanicals, most notably blessed thistle and cardoon; both of which are related to artichokes, making it a bit like Cynar. The other is an herbal liqueur made by monks, only a few of which know the entire recipe (fans of Chartreuse might recognize that story). Flavored with angelica, hyssop and lemon balm, its most notable use is in a Vieux Carré , but it plays an important role in the Holy Smokes by adding a rich, sweet and botanical profile to the drink. A few dashes of Bitter Truth chocolate bitters will not make the drink taste overtly chocolatey but will lend increased complexity and a hint of cocoa that complements the other flavors. Finally, it calls for a teaspoon of Ardbeg Uigeadail. An Islay scotch, Uigeadail is named for the loch that the distillery draws its water from (oo-guh-doll is the pronunciation), and it means “dark and mysterious.” Like other Ardbeg whiskies, this one is extremely peaty, which means even a teaspoon of it gives plenty of smoke to the Holy Smokes. But as the cocktail’s name implies, there’s more than one smoke in the glass. The second comes from flaming a small bit of orange peel over the drink. The process is less challenging than it sounds for first-timers. Simply hold an orange peel zest-side-down over a glass with a few fingers, then gently warm it with a match or lighter. After a few passes with the flame, squeeze the peel to express the oils. If done right, the oils should spark and flame as they pass through the flame, caramelizing as they mist over the drink.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cardamaro vino amaro'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Benedictine'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'The Bitter Truth chocolate bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'Ardbeg Uigeadail single-malt scotch'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, Cardamaro, Benedictine, Bitter Truth chocolate bitters and Ardbeg Uigeadail single-malt scotch into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled small cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a flamed orange peel.']",7,bourbon

While St. Patrick’s Day is notorious for general over-inebriation, Derby Day is famed for its midday Mint Juleps and the winter holidays feature mulled wine, Eggnog and other cold-weather drinks, New Year’s Eve brings a particular level of class and sophistication to drinking. This is, of course, largely to do with the signature drink of the holiday: Champagne. Not everyone has an appreciation for the bubbly French wines, though. Others prefer to toast the end of the year in style with brightly colored bubbly drinks. The New Year’s Sparkler is such a drink; it’s a breeze to make and can be adjusted to individual tastes. The sparkling concoction starts with a berry-flavored vodka. Before the boom of craft vodka labels, this would have meant turning to one of a few big-name brands. Today a number of quality brands produce vodkas flavored with real fruits —Wild Roots, in Portland, Oregon, for instance has a number of berry-infused vodkas, including raspberry, marionberry and cranberry. Each bottle is made with more than a pound of berries, most of which is harvested locally. Other brands with quality fruit vodkas include Ciroc, Finlandia and even Grey Goose, which has a strawberry and lemongrass vodka. Of course, infusing vodka at home is also an option. This gives you control over what type of berries and how much you want to use. While you can use modern devices like sous vide to do so, there’s always the option to add berries to a vodka and let sit in a cool, dark space for a day or two. However you select your berry vodka, the next step is to add pomegranate, cranberry juice or a mix of the two. As with selecting any juice, the level of sweetness is up to you, but it’s always best to avoid ones with artificial flavorings and sweeteners. The last bit of the New Year’s Sparkler is the most important: the wine. Since you’ll be mixing it with fruit vodka and juice, don’t use one that’s too pricey (save the cru and grower Champagne for drinking on their own). Or select another kind of sparkling wine, like an affordable prosecco or cava. Just be sure, again, to avoid anything overly sweet—or else the drink could end up a cloying mess.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'berry-flavored vodka'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pomegranate'}, {'quantity': '3 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Champagne'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'skewered\xa0raspberries', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka and pomegranate or cranberry juice to a chilled Champagne flute.', 'Top with the Champagne.', 'Garnish with raspberries on a long skewer.']",29,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/harry-potter-butterbeer/,Harry Potter Butterbeer,Liquor.com,"The Harry Potter series introduced us to all manner of wizardry, from intricate potions and spells to flying brooms and fantastical creatures. But curious drinkers have always gravitated toward one particular invention: Butterbeer. Fortunately, this fictional drink is simple to replicate, so you don’t need to visit the Three Broomsticks bar to try it. Grown-up wizards and adult muggles alike can make this famous Diagon Alley treat right in their own cauldrons, no spells required. The Butterbeer begins with equal parts vanilla vodka and butterscotch schnapps, which both supply the boozy quotient in this recipe. Cream soda provides the cold, fizzy element, and when combined, the trio yield a drink that is sweet and refreshing. To create the topping, heavy whipping cream is joined by butterscotch syrup and whipped. Put it all together, and you’ve got a drink fit for Potter and his pals. How to Make Non-Alcoholic Butterbeer In the event that underage fans (or lightweight house-elves) want to join the festivities, it’s easy to make Butterbeer nonalcoholic. Simply remove the vanilla vodka and butterscotch schnapps, and replace them with a dash of vanilla extract and butter extract. The flavor will be similar, but without the heady effects.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/oaks-lily/,Oaks Lily,Liquor.com,"The Mint Julep is the undisputed champion of horse-racing drinks. Its relation to the Kentucky Derby is indelible, but you don’t have to know what a furlong is to enjoy an ice-cold julep. The same sentiment applies to the Oaks Lily, the official cocktail of the Bluegrass State’s other big horse race, the Kentucky Oaks, which dates back to 1875. The Kentucky Oaks takes place at Churchill Downs the day before the Kentucky Derby. Rather than simply doubling up on juleps, the race serves its own signature cocktail to attendees. The light, refreshing drink takes its inspiration from the Cosmopolitan and features vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry juice, lemon juice and simple syrup. So, it’s everything you want on a warm day. The cocktail’s pink hue is a nod to the garland of stargazer lilies placed on the race’s winning filly, as well as the race’s association with breast cancer awareness. To support the cause, attendees often don pink attire, from suits and dresses to elaborate hats, and selflessly order Oaks Lillies throughout the day. You, however, don’t need to attend the festivities or wear pink to enjoy the Oaks Lily. All you have to do is merge the ingredients in a glass to channel the fun-loving atmosphere of race day. The Cosmo-like combination will quench your thirst no matter where you are or when you drink it. But after one sip, you may be encouraged to make the pilgrimage to the place of its birth. 21 Cocktails to Make for the Kentucky Derby RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cranberry juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'blackberries'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry juice, lemon juice and simple syrup into a highball glass, then fill with ice and stir gently to combine.', 'Garnish with 2 skewered blackberries and a lemon wheel.']",92,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cucumber-basil-lime-gimlet/,"Cucumber, Basil & Lime Gimlet",Liquor.com,"The Gimlet is a classic combination of gin, lime juice and simple syrup that was likely invented by British sailors in the late 18th century as a way to prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency of vitamin C. Since its inception, the Gimlet has saved lives and quenched thirsts. It has also inspired countless variations, from simple takes like the Vodka Gimlet to more elaborate cocktails featuring fruits, liqueurs and herbs. The Cucumber, Basil & Lime Gimlet calls for muddled cucumbers and basil leaves, giving the drink a boost of fresh produce. It also swaps vodka for the original gin and adds a little lemonade for the ideal warm-weather cocktail. The original Gimlet was made with gin, a dry and botanical spirit, but Vodka Gimlets rose to popularity during the 1980s and 1990s. A milder and more neutral tasting option, vodka can take a back seat and allow other ingredients to wave “hello.” In this case, cucumber and basil provide freshness and aromatic herbal notes, and the lemonade lends a hint of hydrating sweetness, taking the place of sugar. For decades, the Gimlet was predominately made with Rose’s lime cordial, a bottled mixture of lime juice and sugar. But fresh lime juice was used in the original cocktail and is also present in today’s preferred version, adding the rich bite of citrus unavailable outside the real fruit. Try making a Cucumber, Basil & Lime Gimlet on a warm summer day, at your next backyard barbecue or whenever you have some fresh ingredients in the house. The drink is tasty and restorative, and while it doesn’t count as a full serving of vegetables, a little extra green produce in your diet is always a good idea. 11 Vodka Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'slices', 'ingredient': 'cucumber'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'basil leaves'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemonade'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'basil leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Muddle the cucumber and basil in a shaker.', 'Add the vodka, lemonade, lime juice and ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a basil leaf.']",99,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sex-on-the-beach/,Sex on the Beach,Dylan Garret,"The Sex on the Beach cocktail is known as much for its name as its flavor. A combination of vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, cranberry juice and crème de cassis, the Sex on the Beach skyrocketed in popularity in the 1980s and is often seen as a mashup of a Fuzzy Navel (peach schnapps and orange juice) and a Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry juice). It’s unclear exactly when or where the drink was invented, but popular lore has often pointed to a Florida bartender who was said to have created the drink in 1987 as part of a liquor distribution company’s promotion to sell peach schnapps. The problem with that theory, however, is that the Sex on the Beach was already included in the 1982 American Bartenders School Guide to Drinks . Whatever its origins, the memorable name and fruit-forward profile that emphasized candy-like sweetness over classic cocktail structure soon took over drink menus nationwide. Its popularity began to peak after appearing on cocktail lists at TGI Friday’s, at a time when the chain was known for its mixed drinks and singles-scene. Eventually the Sex on the Beach was also name-dropped in the 1987 movie Cocktail starring Tom Cruise, solidifying its place in pop-culture history. After its heyday during the 1980–90s, the Sex on the Beach eventually fell out of favor during the craft cocktail renaissance of the early 2000s. However, despite its checkered history, the drink still remains a popular call at beach bars, tropical dives, and vacation haunts. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog How to Make a Sex on the Beach This cocktail is easy to make, but may take some finesse to perfectly suit your palate. Fresh orange juice is key to making the best Sex on the Beach, as it provides the acidity to necessary temper the sugar-rich schnapps. Some prefer to substitute pineapple juice for OJ, but here we stick with orange to best represent the classic recipe. As a base, almost any decent quality vodka will work, as long as it contains a relatively neutral profile that will allow the schnapps and fruit flavors take center stage. Peach schnapps can be a bit more of a toss-up—the original Sex on the Beach generally used DeKuyper, which was first released in 1984 and became inextricably tied to certain peach-forward drinks of the era, like this and the Fuzzy Navel. For a classically sweet peach flavor, you can stick with a go-to schnapps like DeKuyper Peachtree. However, if you’re looking to broaden your approach, a wide array of peach brandies and liqueurs are now on the market which can help tailor sweetness levels to your living. Try options like Drillaud Creme de Peach for a more complex peach profile, or Montbisou Peche. For those seeking an even drier cocktail, try swapping a peach brandy for the usual peach schnapps, with something like Catoctin Creek Short Hill Mountain Peach Brandy.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'peach schnapps'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Chambord'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cranberry juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cocktail umbrella', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, peach schnapps, Chambord (if using), orange juice and cranberry juice to a shaker with ice and shake.', 'Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a cocktail umbrella.']",452,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/botanical-bees-knees/,Botanical Bee’s Knees,Liquor.com,"The Bee’s Knees is a classic cocktail featuring gin, lemon juice and honey. This, however, is the Botanical Bee’s Knees, a modern cocktail that subs vodka for gin and adds chamomile tea. Lest you were concerned that vodka would get lost among the flavorful mix of ingredients, fear not: The vodka is a botanical peach-and-orange-blossom-flavored expression from Ketel One, which adds a burst of fresh and juicy accents. The Dutch company produces a few different vodkas made with real botanicals, natural fruit essences and no artificial flavors or sweeteners. “The distillation process and taste are so distinctive from flavored vodka and offer such a unique alternative to wine that [we] refer to the different variants as varietals,” says Ketel One brand director Jim Ruane. The essences and botanicals for each are distilled at the beginning of the process rather than introducing them at the end, as is done with flavored vodka, so they’re better integrated into the final product. Ruane describes the Peach & Orange Blossom vodka’s profile as “lush, juicy white peaches and bold notes of fragrant orange blossoms.” That baseline of juicy fruit complements the chamomile tea, which lends a delicate floral quality to the honey and lemon, yielding a drink that is fresh, flavorful and a fun upgrade to the classic recipe. You can easily make the Botanical Bee’s Knees at home by steeping some tea, letting it cool and then shaking all the ingredients with ice. Pour yourself an ice-cold drink, bask in each refreshing sip and consider making “afternoon tea” part of your daily regimen. On the Fence About Gin? Try These 3 Botanical Vodkas.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hot-buttered-rum/,Hot Buttered Rum,Wayne Curtis,"Why does a big sip of Hot Buttered Rum hit the spot in winter? The answer is in the name itself: It’s hot, it has butter and it has rum. It’s comfort food in a mug, plain and simple. Yet for some reason, this assessment isn’t universal. Dyspeptic cocktailian David Embury states in his 1948 book, “The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks,” that this classic rum drink was “the worst” hot concoction. “The lump of butter is the final insult,” he says. “It blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with champagne! I believe that the drinking of Hot Buttered Rum should be permitted only in the Northwest Passage and, even there, only by highly imaginative and overenthusiastic novelists.” Embury was sticking a shiv in Kenneth Roberts, the author of the 1937 bestselling historical novel, “ Northwest Passage .” Roberts had all but single-handedly returned to favor this obscure colonial rum drink by incorporating it into his tale. “After a man’s had two-three drinks of Hot Buttered Rum, he don’t shoot a catamount,” states Roberts. “All he’s got to do is walk up to him and kiss him just once, then put him in his bag, all limp.” Perhaps not surprisingly, a small mania was born from it. Even Tiki maven Trader Vic included the Hot Buttered Rum cocktail in his 1946 “Book of Food and Drink,” with a nod to Roberts. To Embury’s credit, he does single out the chief flaw in lesser versions of the drink: the greasy blob of melted butter floating on the surface, as recipes often call for simply adding a dollop before serving. The best solution to this buttery problem, however, is to instead use a batter made with, oddly enough, ice cream. This can then easily be stored in the freezer all winter, ready for use whenever desired. Once that’s batched, all you need is some rum and some boiling water, leading to a smooth, creamy and perfectly incorporated Hot Buttered Rum.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/blue-hawaiian/,Blue Hawaiian,Liquor.com,"The Blue Hawaiian is a perfect summer drink, and one that tastes great beside a body of water. Any body of water, really. That makes sense, considering that in some circles this cocktail is known as the Swimming Pool. The Blue Hawaiian is not to be confused with the Harry Yee classic, the Blue Hawaii , which was created in Honolulu in 1957 and features vodka, light rum, blue curaçao, pineapple juice and freshly made sweet-and-sour. Instead, the Blue Hawaiian, likely an adaptation of Yee’s cocktail, is little more than a doctored Piña Colada . It calls for light rum, pineapple juice, lemon juice, cream of coconut and blue curaçao. The addition of this orange-flavored liqueur makes the drink tall and teal, as aggressively tropical as it is pleasing to the eye. The Blue Hawaiian is shaken with ice, but you can also make it frozen. If you want to go down this chilly road, add all the ingredients to a blender with ice and whir the contents into a smooth, slushy and creamy treat. This version is especially refreshing on a hot day, when ice-cold drinks are the only viable protection from the scorching sun. If you’d like to lighten the drink, you can use coconut milk in place of the cream of coconut. The milk still provides the necessary coconut flavor, but since it’s not as thick or rich as the cream, it cuts some of the cocktail’s creamy sweetness. It’s not a bad strategy if one Blue Hawaiian happens to turn into three.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bermuda-rum-swizzle/,Bermuda Rum Swizzle,Liquor.com,"The Rum Swizzle is the national drink of Bermuda. It’s enjoyed in bars across the island nation and has become a staple on Tiki bar menus across the world. Swizzles have taken different forms over the centuries, with references to the drink dating back to the 18th century, but the Swizzle Inn, which houses Bermuda’s oldest pub, is associated with the modern version of the cocktail. Rum Swizzle recipes vary, but most have three ingredients in common: rum, fruit juice and a sweetener like grenadine or falernum. It’s common for swizzles to contain multiple rums and juices, adding flavor and complexity to the drink. That convention is what you’ll find in the Bermuda Rum Swizzle; it calls for two different expressions of Gosling’s rum, a locally made brand that’s a popular choice in cocktails and a must-have when making the Dark ’n Stormy . To prepare a Rum Swizzle, it’s traditional to use an authentic swizzle stick. Real swizzle sticks are long stems snapped off a tree native to the Caribbean and feature multiple prongs that protrude horizontally. While authentic swizzle sticks may be preferred, versions made from a different type of wood or from metal or plastic are much more commonly found. When spun rapidly between your hands inside a cold cocktail, the stick will create a thick layer of frost on the outside of a glass—the sign of a perfect swizzle. This recipe is made in a pitcher and serves four people, but you can easily scale the ingredients up or down to accommodate more or fewer servings. If you’re making one cocktail, simply cut the proportions into quarters and swizzle in your glass or shake everything with ice and strain the contents into a rocks glass over fresh ice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/blue-blazer/,Blue Blazer,Liquor.com,"When discussing the more flamboyant aspects of bartending, people’s minds often go to the halcyon days of 90s “flair bartending,” when showy bar workers would spin bottles and shakers, juggling the ingredients before pouring them as long streams into their waiting receptacles. But making a simple cocktail with an overabundance of showmanship appears to be as old as cocktail bartending itself. Meet the Blue Blazer: this age-old classic was invented by bartender Jerry Thomas, known as the grandfather of modern bartending, and while it’s essentially a scotch Hot Toddy with extra pyrotechnics, its worth the risks that come with it, especially if you’re a fan of cocktail history and fire . According to the most popular theory, the Blue Blazer’s origins can be traced to a gambling saloon in Gold Rush-era San Francisco, where Thomas hatched the idea. In his 1862 “Bar-tenders Guide,” he describes the drink as a “blazing stream of liquid fire,” which sums it up well. There are a few legends of how, precisely, it came to be, but what’s most important is the technique. For one, the area should be cleared of anything flammable, especially spilled alcohol that could cause a conflagration—even still, it’s wise to keep an extinguisher on hand at all times while making this drink. After pre-heating two glass mugs with boiling water, you’ll want to add more boiling water, scotch and sugar to one, then light it with a long-stemmed match. The resulting flames will be a vivid blue. Pour the mixture smoothly and assertively into the awaiting mug, taking care not to splash anything, creating a single blue flame stream. If you’ve never made a drink like the Blue Blazer before, it’s advisable to practice pouring water between mugs before using any flame. Even then, it’s best to start with the mugs low and close together. Once you’ve got a few attempts under your belt without lighting anything on fire, you can start pulling the mugs further apart, creating a longer, more impressive stream. And, as usual with pyrotechnics, keeping the lights lower and dimmer will allow your enthralled guests to better witness the art of the Blue Blazer.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-modern-cocktail/,The Modern,David Wondrich,"What is modern? In 1979, when I graduated from high school, it was calculators and stereos that let you thread a stack of LPs onto a little thingamajig that held them precariously above the turntable, dropping them down to play one by one. The latest thing in cars was the Datsun 280Z, and to be truly styling when you drove, you needed to be wearing a burgundy turtleneck with a short gold zipper on the front. And it had to be open, to display the band of puka shells around your neck. In 1961, when I was born, cars still had fins, women wore pillbox hats and the Princess phone—the latest in home electronics—still had a dial. Time has a way of mocking us all, of making our attempts at the new seem futile and, worse, silly. But there are always a few things that come across fresh and, yes, modern, no matter how old they are. Frank Lloyd Wright’s houses, Bugs Bunny cartoons, the music of Charlie Parker—these know no age. The first Dry Martini might have been stirred up in the 1880s or early 1890s, but a sip of one conveys the shock of the new as well as anything in which Lady Gaga cocoons herself. Of course, there are other drinks that have achieved escape velocity from the orbit of their times. Most of those are sleek, simple and unencumbered with the kind of eccentricity that anchors things to an era and place. The Modern Cocktail, however, is, despite its name, not one of them. Invented in the first decade of the 20th century by Charlie Mahoney, head bartender at New York’s famed Hoffman House hotel on Madison Square, the Modern combines the two trendiest ingredients of the period: Scotch whisky and sloe gin .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/whisky-in-church/,Whisky in Church,Liquor.com,"Sherry and scotch whisky make a great pair in cocktails, perhaps evidenced by the centuries-old practice of aging the latter in casks that once held the former. Whisky in Church, a take of sorts on a Rob Roy , comes from Erik Reichborn-Kjennerud and Todd Smith of Dalva in San Francisco and is a classic example of the magic that can be created when sherry, wood, and whisky collide. In this riff, the usual sweet vermouth is replaced with rich oloroso sherry and a bit of dark, intense Grade B maple syrup—two intense flavors that work in tandem to balance the intensely peaty flavors of the Islay scotch that forms the drink’s base. A hit of smoked cherry bitters takes the place of the ordinary (and more modest quantity of) Angostura bitters for a finishing touch of fruit-forward baking spice to round it all out. Much like its fellow classics, the Rob Roy template is one that’s stood the test of time for a reason. Believed to have been created circa 1894 at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, the simple combination of whisky, fortified wine and bitters—when well-executed—is all about letting each ingredient shine with little distraction, all the while offering a drinking experience that’s greater than the sum of its parts. The Rob Roy has inspired countless riffs like the Whisky in Church, and when mixing one of these up at home, don't be afraid to put your own spin on things in the spirit of the many great bartenders before you. For example, if two ounces of Islay scotch is too much peat for your palate, consider splitting your base with a blended or single malt scotch whisky that’s lower in peat content so as to dial down the smoke without taking a completely different direction than what Smith and Reichborn-Kjennerud intended. For those who do enjoy the intensity of Islay scotch, however, there’s much more exploring to be done while in this territory—for example, the Prophet in Plain Clothes calls for Laphroaig, Fernet Branca, sweet vermouth and Amaro Cinpatrazzo, yielding a bitter, smoky drink that shows a wildly different side of the Rob Roy spectrum. Or, if you’re looking to punch up the fruit and body, try the Islay and port-based 25th Hour . There’s a Rob Roy riff for everyone, and finding yours is half the fun.

He knows a thing or two about combining unexpected flavors, and that skill is on display here. The cocktail begins with Johnnie Walker Red Label, a workhorse blended scotch that makes a great highball. Most highballs (think Scotch & Soda ) contain a spirit and a larger portion of non-alcoholic mixer, like sparkling water or ginger ale. But the Big Red takes its own path by calling for equal measures of beer and ginger beer. The former intensifies the refreshment, while the latter adds a welcome blend of spice and sweetness. When considering which ginger beer to use, you can choose from one of the many high-quality options on store shelves, or you can try making it yourself. The DIY version is delicious, rewarding and easier to make than you might think. And, while Budweiser is never difficult to source, you can experiment with other lagers if you want.

The two ingredients can also be enjoyed in cocktail form and utilized in drinks like the one you see here. She’s No Gentleman is a rich and tasty scotch cocktail that can warm you on even the coldest winter days. Rather than fresh raspberries, it calls for Chambord, a dark purple liqueur from France that is sweet and viscous with notes of bright acidity. “One of the most common misconceptions about Chambord is that it’s a one-note spirit,” says Julia Ebell, the creative director at The Gibson in Washington, D.C. “Raspberry is the star, but don’t forget the other flavors: vanilla, honey and citrus peel.” She says that the vanilla flavor works especially well with smoky spirits like scotch and mezcal and also with funky flavors like those found in rum and pisco. And the liqueur’s honey notes are a great match with high-tannin teas. Ebell’s recipe features blended scotch, Chambord, cream and homemade Earl Grey syrup. The scotch provides a solid base for the heavier ingredients to stand on, while the floral syrup adds a welcome hint of bergamot-provided citrus and black-tea tannins.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spanish-armada/,Spanish Armada,Liquor.com,"Rum and brandy can be employed in many classic and modern drinks. The same goes for sherry, scotch and even amer, a lesser-known French liqueur that’s loaded with bittersweet orange and spice notes. And bitters, of course, are an essential tool in any bartender’s arsenal. It’s not often that one harnesses all of the aforementioned ingredients into a well-balanced cocktail, but that’s exactly what you’ll find with the Spanish Armada. This complex cocktail can be traced to Vol. 39, a sleek, spirit-forward bar hidden on the second floor of the Kimpton Gray hotel in Chicago where Old Fashioned variations and a six- Martini flight are staples. The Spanish Armada by bartender Jessica Lambert charts its own course, channeling a diverse array of ingredients into a multi-layered drink. Lambert begins with equal measures of El Dorado 12-year-old rum from Guyana and Lustau Brandy de Jerez, a solera-aged Spanish brandy. Lustau PX sherry adds velvety notes of dates, raisins and figs, while Bigallet China-China amer lends a bitter orange accent. The drink’s peaty, nuanced secret? The Famous Grouse Smoky Black blended scotch—at only a quarter ounce, the scotch punches out of its weight class and makes itself known among the other strongly flavored ingredients. Finally, the savory spice layers unfold with a trio of bitters: Bittercube Jamaican No. 1, Angostura and The Bitter End curry bitters. There’s a lot going on in this drink, but the rich and complex experience remains balanced from beginning to end. 11 Rum Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lustau Brandy de Jerez'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'scotch'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Bigallet China-China amer'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, Brandy de Jerez, blended scotch, PX sherry, China-China amer and all three bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled', 'Strain into a Nick & Nora glass.', 'Express the oils from an orange peel over the top of the drink, and garnish with the peel.']",4,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/carrot-thing/,Carrot Thing,Liquor.com,"When it was open, New York City’s chic steakhouse Saxon + Parole would play with plenty of fresh produce on its cocktail menu, so much so that guests would often request a drink by its primary fruit or vegetable. Depending on the season, diners would often ask for “that watermelon thing” or “that pumpkin thing.” Wanting to stay one step ahead of of this habit, lead bartenders Maxime Belfand and Masa Urushido named their heirloom-carrot-packed winter drink accordingly. The Carrot Thing is a uniquely vegetal drink, getting much of its sweetness from heirloom carrot juice and its smokiness from a split-spirit base. Split-base cocktails are uncommon but not unheard of, and scotch and mezcal are a natural pairing for those wanting serious smoke in their drinking glass. For the mezcal, Belfand and Urushido would use Del Maguey’s Vida, a ubiquitous label that’s popular among bartenders. Nevertheless, the precise brand isn’t integral to the drink, and another espadin mezcal can stand in its place. More specific is the scotch, which is Great King Street Glasgow Blend from Compass Box. Pale, complex and smoky, it’s an elegant spirit more commonly used for sipping than mixing, but it plays well in the Carrot Thing. It’s also not available in every market, and with the amount of other ingredients in the drink, it’s acceptable to use a different smoky blended scotch of light body. The heirloom carrot juice gives the drink its name, and bartenders at Saxon + Parole would make the juice with a blend of purple, orange and yellow heirloom carrots. If you can find those at a local farmers market or grocery store, you can juice them for a fully accurate recreation. If you cannot, using a high quality store-bought brand carrot juice is significantly easier. Licor 43—a slightly fruity Spanish liqueur with notes of vanilla and other botanicals—adds depth and sweetness, which is bolstered by agave syrup and balanced with lemon juice. The resulting drink is smoky but refreshing, vegetal but sweet, and certainly unique. 5 New Blended Scotches to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Del Maguey Vida mezcal'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Great King St. Glasgow Blend scotch'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Licor 43'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'heirloom carrot juice (purple, orange and yellow)'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'smoked Maldon sea salt', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'carrot chip', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Prepare a rocks glass with a half-rim of smoked Maldon sea salt.', 'Add the mezcal, scotch, Licor 43, heirloom carrot juice, lemon juice and agave syrup to a shaker with ice, and shake until chilled.', 'Strain over fresh ice into the prepared glass, and garnish with a carrot chip.']",4,mezcal

It’s easy to make, easy to remember and, frankly, not especially compelling to drink. Though it has its diehard enthusiasts, for many it comes off as cloying and artificial tasting. However, some bartenders have used it as a base for inspiration , improving upon the formula with different whiskeys and mixers. This version comes from bartender Nick Bennett, the beverage director at New York City bar Porchlight , which gives the variation its name. It’s considerably more complicated than its two-ingredient origin—it involves no fewer than five whiskeys, a homemade syrup and the use of a CO2 carbonator—but it’s worth making to see what heights a 7&7 can aspire to. In the Porchlight 7&7 Bennett combines Mellow Corn, Dickel no. 12 Tennessee Sour Mash, Candian Club Rye, Old Overholt and Cobalt whiskeys to imitate Seagram’s blended style and adds a touch of Cointreau to play up the drink’s citrus qualities. House citrus syrup and black tea take the place of 7UP, and then Bennett kegs and carbonates the drink. Because of the small proportions for ingredients like the Corsair Triple Smoke American malt whiskey, which only gets an eighth of an ounce added, as well as the forced carbonation, it’s advisable to make this drink in large batches and then portion it out to individual glasses or keep in the fridge.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/washington-apple-shot/,Washington Apple Shot,Liquor.com,"The Washington Apple Shot is a slammable version of the Washington Apple cocktail, nothing more, nothing less. Its equal-parts recipe of Canadian whisky, sour apple schnapps and cranberry juice can be scaled up or down, depending on the occasion. If you’re serving a crowd, multiply each ingredient by however many drinkers are in your midst, and fill a few shaker tins. Then you’ll be ready to pour the contents and toast with your friends—always better than downing a solo shot. The Washington Apple Shot is surprisingly balanced considering it calls for two tart, sweet mixers. The strong Canadian whisky cuts through the cranberry and the sour-apple schnapps, and the club soda adds a hint of dilution and effervescence, which ties the other ingredients together with a neat bow. When deciding on your whisky, choose your favorite bottle. You just want something with enough punch and structure to stand up against those mixers. If you’re looking to pull back the tartness of this shot, you can substitute Calvados for the schnapps. This French apple brandy adds apple flavor, minus the artificial sweeteners and mouth-puckering sourness. It also increases the drink’s proof. If you do go the Calvados route, you’re not technically making a Washington Apple Shot.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/alabama-slammer/,Alabama Slammer,Liquor.com,"The Alabama Slammer might be the most ’70s of all the bright and fruity 1970s cocktails. Its base blend of amaretto, sloe gin and Southern Comfort stands in total defiance of what one would expect from a staunch Southern sipper. The Alabama Slammer is one of those drinks that, on paper, confuses. Southern Comfort (or SoCo, if you prefer) is a whiskey-based liqueur with notes of fruit and spice. Sloe gin is made from small, tart berries that grow wild in England, and amaretto is the sweet and nutty liqueur best known for its starring role in the Amaretto Sour . Those disparate ingredients are brought into alignment with the citrusy bite of orange juice and some welcome dilution that occurs when you shake everything together. (For the best results, squeeze a couple oranges for a fresher, better-tasting drink.) Said to have been born at the University of Alabama, the Slammer is a go-to at Crimson Tide tailgates, where it’s often served as a shot. And slamming one back certainly gets the point across. The nutty, herbal notes, backed by baking spices and citrus, come through loud and clear. But to truly appreciate the unique blend of ingredients that comprise the Alabama Slammer, shake the ingredients with plenty of ice and serve the drink in a tall glass. The flavors will loosen and unfold at a leisurely pace, leaving you with a mellower, more Southern-tasting drink. After an impressive run through the ’70s, ’80s and ’90s, the Alabama Slammer has lost some of its appeal. But it remains a popular drink in parts of its home state and continues to find eager patrons at college bars across the country who appreciate its fruity flavor and heady effects. See what all the fuss is about by mixing one for yourself.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/washington-apple/,Washington Apple,Liquor.com,"The Washington Apple is a crisp, tart cocktail that is a breeze to make and even easier to drink. As the story goes, the drink was created in the late-1980s, after a nasty bug decimated much of Washington state’s apple orchards. An enterprising man named Christof Guycoogan fermented and distilled those ruined apples to make apple liqueur, which complemented his favorite drink: Canadian whisky mixed with a splash of cranberry juice. The combination of Canadian whisky , apple liqueur and cranberry juice proved popular throughout the ensuing decade, and it’s still a common call today at bars across the country. Any Canadian whisky can work nicely in this cocktail, and the apple element is typically supplied by bright-green sour-apple schnapps. If you’d like to add a crafty element to the drink, try replacing the schnapps with a high-quality apple liqueur or even Calvados, a French apple brandy. This will net great apple flavor, with less tartness (the cranberry already provides plenty of that) and without any artificial flavors. The Washington Apple cocktail is also popular served as a shot. You can make a smaller version of the original by simply reducing each ingredient and keeping the ratios the same. Shake everything, pour the liquid into a shot glass, and down the delicious drink in one sip.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hearn/,Hearn,Liquor.com,"Rye, bourbon and, to a lesser extent, scotch are the whiskeys that regularly see usage in all manner of cocktail. However, their brethren across the sea don’t tend to get as much love, as only a few cocktails call for Irish whiskey . Still, Irish whiskey cocktails have seen a general rise in popularity in the past decade, and the Hearn is one such example. It makes sense that a bartender like Jack McGarry would create a cocktail like the Hearn. Co-founder of the celebrated Dead Rabbit in New York City, McGarry is well-versed in making Irish whiskey cocktails, as the bar is dedicated to the single malts and blended whiskeys of the Emerald Isle. The Hearn is a variation on arguably the most famous Irish whiskey cocktail, the Tipperary , which sees Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth and Green Chartreuse —a deeply botanical spirit made by Carthusian monks with a secret recipe—as well as Angostura bitters combined for a bracing, botanical and rich cocktail. The Hearn has a few differences from its predecessor. For one, McGarry has tweaked the proportions, increasing the amount of sweet vermouth normally called for. He also amplifies the botanical aspect of the cocktail by adding a few dashes of absinthe and substituting Angostura bitters for orange bitters and the Dead Rabbit’s own Orinoco Bitters. With flavors including cardamom, cassia and chamomile, these bitters add warmth and depth to the drink. Unlike most bitters made for bars that never see consumer access, you can get your hands on the ones made for Dead Rabbit by Doctor Adams from the House of Botanicals in Aberdeen, Scotland. However, if all you have on hand is Angostura bitters those can still work. Just be sure to taste for bitterness levels before adding all four dashes, as it can get overwhelming. For the base spirit, McGarry uses Knappogue Castle 12 Year , a single malt Irish whiskey. While it makes for a stunning drink, the whiskey can be pricey in certain markets; other Irish single malts work well in its place, and Dead Rabbit even has its own Irish whiskey that would work quite well. The Dead Rabbit Irish Whiskey is a blend of single malts and grain whiskey, and it unsurprisingly makes for a fine inclusion in the Hearn.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Irish Whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'green Chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, green Chartreuse, absinthe, Orinoco Bitters and orange bitters to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Twist a swath of orange peel over the drink to release the oils and discard the peel.']",7,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/isaiah-rynders/,Isaiah Rynders,Liquor.com,"The Dark ’n Stormy is a classic highball, a spicy-sweet mixture of ginger beer, lime and dark rum. That simple base means it has plenty of versatility to work with for adaptations and variations while its retaining the core identity. A simple change can be to swap the rum for another spirit, or add an additional ingredient to change the flavor profile, but other variations can be more dramatic. One such take on the consummate gingery rum highball is the Isaiah Rynders. The drink is named for Captain Isaiah Rynders, who lived in New York City through the 19th century. A political heavyweight and member of the Tammany Hall group, Rynders regularly engaged in voter intimidation, election fraud and political violence, even helping figures like former presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan rise to power. Like its namesake, the Isaiah Rynders packs quite a punch. Rather than rum, the drink calls for two kinds of Irish whiskey, an homage to Rynders’ heritage and the political groups he ran with. In particular it calls for Jameson Black Barrel, a version of the famed Irish whiskey that’s aged in twice-charred bourbon barrels. It also gets half an ounce of Connemara cask-strength peated Irish whiskey, a smokey, high proof spirit that adds some extra oomph to the drink. While the recipe doesn’t call for ginger beer, it still gets some spice and herbs by way of Cardamaro, an amaro made with cardoon and blessed thistle, along with other botanicals. A number of dashes of Orinoco bitters from the famed New York City Irish bar Dead Rabbit (whose name comes from a 19th century criminal organization that Rynders was aligned with), some ginger syrup and tamarind chutney, which can be found in grocery stores, round out the spices and botanicals in the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/green-tea-highball/,Green Tea Highball,Liquor.com,"In recent years, Japanese whisky has become incredibly popular in the United States, with sales booming over the last decade as Japanese distillers struggle to match production with the demand . One of the most popular ways to enjoy the variety of whiskies from Japan is in a highball . In fact, the highball has become inexorably linked to Japanese whisky, so much so that a misconception has developed that a highball or neat are the only “right” ways to consume the stuff. Misconception or no, a highball is a splendid way to try Japanese whiskies, and there’s no requirement that it has to be topped with club soda alone. In the Green Tea Highball, the whisky is combined with Japan’s most consumed beverage: green tea. The most common type of green tea in the country is sencha, produced by picking only the youngest tea leaves, which are then steamed, rolled and dried. In this highball, the tea adds a bit of body, tannin structure and sweetness to complement the whisky. One of the benefits of the Green Tea Highball is its versatility. While using a bottle like the affordable and accessible Suntory Toki will make a delightful drink, there’s an opportunity here to try your hand with whatever Japanese whisky you can find. Availability can range wildly for different brands and expressions, but if you can find a favorite and play with combinations using different green teas until it clicks, you may find your new favorite highball recipe. Another trendy aspect of highballs, especially those made with Japanese whisky, is the use of a long, slender ice spear. However, if you don’t have the mold for it, feel free to use a number of larger ice cubes. The important thing is to avoid too much surface area in order to slow dilution. Finally, while citrus oils are a common finishing touch for a whisky highball, the Green Tea Highball gets its citrus element from the tea. So instead of a lemon or lime peel, it’s garnished with a maple leaf candy, which provides a sweet treat that can be enjoyed alongside the drink, enhancing the sweetness of the tea and whisky.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-good-cork/,Good Cork,Liquor.com,"Veteran New York City bartender Phil Ward’s contributions to the cocktail industry are immeasurable—he’s worked behind (and owned) some of the best bars in the boroughs and is credited with an impressive list of modern classics, namely the Oaxaca Old Fashioned , which he created for Death & Co in 2007. Though perhaps lesser-known, Ward’s Good Cork cocktail is just as likely to become a regular in your repertoire, especially if you’re a fan of Irish whiskey. And mezcal. Or unlikely-yet-surprisingly-good spirit combinations in general. Originally featured on the Mayahuel menu, the Good Cork combines its two base spirits in equal parts alongside a bit of Benedictine and Peychaud’s bitters for a winning combination. It’s the spirit-forward nightcap you never knew you needed. Mayahuel, may it rest in peace, was Ward’s ode to agave spirits and was widely beloved by industry and everyday drinkers alike—in fact, we can trace the contemporary agave-based cocktail boom to this bar, and the spirit of Mayahuel lives on, much like Ward’s affinity for mezcal and its ilk. But where does the Irish whiskey come in, you ask? For starters, this spirit brings both body and a different spectrum of fruit notes than what you’d ordinarily find in mezcal, and Ward uses single pot still Irish whiskey in this cocktail to boot, which parallels the distillation process used to make mezcal. Pot still Irish whiskeys tend to lean funky and spicy, which stands up nicely against the smoke—subtle or not-so—brought forth by its partner in crime here.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mcglashan/,McGlashan,Liquor.com,"Though not quite as popular as bourbon or rye cocktails, Irish whiskey drinks have become increasingly commonplace in recent years. This is partly thanks to Irish bars like The Dead Rabbit , one of New York City’s most famous drinking establishments. One cocktail that exemplifies how good Irish whiskey can be in a drink is the Dead Rabbit’s McGlashan, from bartender Jack McGarry. Essentially a complicated twist on a Whiskey Sour , it combines some unconventional ingredients for a bright, vivid and layered result. The base for the McGlashan is Knappogue Castle 12, a single malt Irish whiskey that’s both affordable and delicious, on its own and mixed in drinks. McGarry adds to this a measure of oloroso sherry. This dry, oxidized wine adds considerable depth to drinks like the McGlashan, as well as a subtle nuttiness and salinity. Lemon juice adds tartness and balance, but rather than rely on a traditional plain simple syrup, McGarry uses a ginger syrup for a touch of spice. The sweetness, ginger spice and fruity acid is amplified by another unconventional ingredient: orange-ginger marmalade. That can be much harder to find than the more commonplace orange marmalade, so if you can’t find it on your neighborhood grocery store’s shelves, you can shop online or just use a regular orange marmalade. If go the latter route, consider increasing the ginger in the ginger syrup. Finally, McGarry adds a few dashes of Dead Rabbit’s own Orinoco Bitters , which are available from Dr. Adam’s, a Scottish apothecary that made the bitters for the bar. The resulting drink is strong and layered with fruity, gingery and nutty flavors. 20 Irish Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Knappogue Castle 12 year old single malt Irish whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'oloroso sherry'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ginger syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'orange-ginger marmalade'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'The Dead Rabbit Orinoco Bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'freshly grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Knappogue Castle 12 year old, oloroso sherry, lemon juice, ginger syrup, orange-ginger marmalade and Dead Rabbit orinoco bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",13,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-dead-rabbit-coffee-cocktail/,The Dead Rabbit Coffee Cocktail,Liquor.com,"The Coffee Cocktail is a historic drink that likely originated in New Orleans alongside other iconic concoctions like the Sazerac and Vieux Carré . But what is perhaps surprising about the Coffee Cocktail is the glaring omission of anything caffeinated—there’s no coffee in this delicious libation. Furthermore, early transcribers of the drink described the name as a misnomer for also lacking bitters, an essential ingredient in anything originally called a “cocktail.” Its original recipe called for a mix of ruby Port and cognac along with a whole egg, putting the Coffee Cocktail in the category of a flip . The result was a drink that vaguely resembled coffee with cream, the probable origin of its name. However, in this version from Jack McGarry of New York’s legendary Irish Bar the Dead Rabbit , the drink gets a makeover with Irish whiskey standing in for brandy and the addition of Irish cream liqueur. Like the original recipe, the spirits are in equal parts. At the Dead Rabbit the drink is made with Brady’s Irish Cream Liqueur , Clontarf Irish whiskey and Graham’s Late Bottle vintage Port (rather than a ruby Port). However, when making the recipe, the quality of each ingredient is more important than getting the specific brand right. Bailey’s is an acceptable substitution for the Irish cream, or you can even try your hand at making your own . Instead of the Clontarf—a quality and affordable Irish whiskey—you could use something like Powers, Knappogue Castle, Tullamore D.E.W., or even Jameson or Bushmills. The Port, similarly, can be replaced with another as long as you stick to a late-bottled vintage Port to maintain the flavor profile. And, unlike the original recipe, the Dead Rabbit version does have bitters. In particular, it calls for Dead Rabbit’s own Orinoco Bitters , which are available from Dr. Adam’s, a Scottish apothecary who made the bitters for the bar. With no caffeine, a frothy rich body and the sweetness of Irish cream and Port, the Dead Rabbit Coffee Cocktail is best served as an after-dinner drink , alongside a sweet treat or as the dessert itself.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-valentino/,Valentino,Liquor.com,"The Valentino cocktail was created in 2011 by New York bartending veterans Lynette Marrero and Jim Kearns. Together they built the cocktail menu for the now-closed Astor Room, a supper club in Queens, New York. The Astor Room was located at Kaufman Astoria Studios, which once belonged to Paramount Pictures and was a favorite among film stars, hence the menu featuring the Valentino cocktail and other film-focused drinks. The Valentino paid tribute to Rudolph Valentino, an Italian actor based in the U.S. who starred in several popular silent films in the early 20th century. It’s a variation on the classic Negroni (gin, Campari, sweet vermouth) that offers drinkers a choose-your-own-adventure starting point of gin, vodka or rye whiskey. Gin keeps the cocktail similar to the Negroni, while vodka dials back the bracing botanicals and whiskey moves the profile closer to a Boulevardier . Beyond the plug-and-play base spirits, the Valentino differs from the Negroni in its ratios. Rather than equal parts of each, it calls for four parts spirit to one part Campari and vermouth. This puts the focus more squarely on the spirit, producing a stronger and less bitter cocktail than the classic. The three-ingredient Valentino is simply stirred with ice, strained into a cocktail glass and garnished with an orange peel, so it’s easy to construct at home.

It’s “one of my favorite party tricks,” says Young, “using bright and acidic tomatillos, a close relative of the tomato most commonly used in Mexican cuisine and which are now fairly ubiquitous in the produce section of most supermarkets.” Tomatillos may look sort of like green tomatoes, but their flavor is quite different: bright and acidic, with a hint of lemon. In this recipe, a dozen of them get juiced and the results combined with the juice of a cucumber and a half-dozen celery sticks. The vegetal mix gets spiced up with salt, pepper, green Tabasco and, most importantly, a hearty pour of mezcal. The shooters are perfect for brunch, afternoon gatherings or any other festive time.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/conflict-and-compromise/,Conflict & Compromise,Liquor.com,"If you have a bottle of Midori at home, it’s possible you’re struggling to figure out what to do with it. Flavored with funky indigenous melon varieties including muskmelon and Yubari, it’s generally relegated to the occasional retro round of Midori Sours . But there are plenty of opportunities to utilize the electric green Japanese liqueur in mixed drinks. Brock Schulte, the bar director at The Monarch in Kansas City, Missouri, brings out its potential in his Conflict & Compromise, a spicy and verdant Margarita variation. For Schulte, two of Midori’s most questionable traits are the very things that make it fun to play with in drinks like the Conflict & Compromise. “[Its] best attributes are its color and ability to play well with others,” he says. “It lends itself to all kinds of infusions and plays well with herbs, spices [and] heat like cayenne.” In this drink he combines Midori with cilantro and jalapeño for a juicy, spicy libation. The Midori stands in for the usual orange liqueur, lending its fresh melon notes to the earthy tequila and tart lime. It mellows the spice from the jalapeño and sweetens the crisp vegetal notes of cilantro. For the tequila, Schulte uses Tequila Ocho plata, a well-regarded blanco tequila. Any decent quality blanco tequila should do—just be sure to use a good-quality one. It doesn’t need to be too expensive of a bottle, however, as it will be mixed with peppers, herbs and melon liqueur. Of course, when making any drink with cilantro, you might alienate those who taste cilantro as being “soapy,” which is not an uncommon reaction. There’s no real work-around here—omitting the leaves or substituting them for an herb like parsley will dramatically alter the drink’s profile. It might still be good, but it won’t quite be the Conflict & Compromise. Instead, consider using the Midori in another cocktail. What the #$@! Do I Do with This? Midori: What It Is and How to Use It.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/horn-of-the-bulls/,Horn of the Bulls,Kelly Magyarics,"Midori —the electric green melon-flavored liqueur from Japan—is an oft-maligned product, though one that in recent years has started to see something of a revival in cocktail bars. This is thanks in part to its recipe being changed in 2012 to omit some of the sugars and include more natural flavors. Will Lee, the beverage director of Grey Ghost and Second Best in Detroit, is a big fan of pairing Midori with clear and grassy spirits like herbaceous gins and blanco tequilas. He’s also a fan of mixing it with salty ingredients. “I always like to pair bright melon flavors with savory and salinic notes—ingredients such as sesame seed, sesame oil, salts and different spice blends,” says Lee. As for the green liqueur’s propensity for sweetness, he says, “As long as you’re able to balance those flavors, it can be a great complementary component to use in any cocktail.” These elements come together in the Horn of the Bulls. This blanco tequila drink relies mostly on Midori for sweetness, along with pineapple juice that also adds some necessary acidity and an easy-to-make cucumber simple syrup, which adds crisp, vegetal notes. Together with the earthy, spicy-sweet notes of tequila, these vivid and intense flavors are balanced and smoothed out with the addition of egg white and heavy cream. When topped with club soda, it becomes a tequila and Midori-infused take on a Ramos Gin Fizz , meaning it works perfectly well as a breakfast drink. While the cucumber simple syrup is a lovely fit in the Horn of the Bulls, it also pairs well with gin and tequila to add some extra summery notes to Gimlets and Margaritas . What the #$@!

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/anogo/,Añogo,Liquor.com,"Eggnog is a consummate holiday drink, one many drinkers look forward to enjoying whenever the weather cools and the sun hides. Traditionally it’s made with spirits like brandy, rum or whiskey, but agave spirits are a delicious choice as well . An aged tequila will add nuance and complexity to an Eggnog, while differentiating it from the more familiar styles. San Francisco cocktail pioneer H. Joseph Ehrmann’s take on the classic concoction, the Añogo, blends añejo tequila with amontillado sherry for a nutty, buttery result. Generally you’ll want to make the Eggnog mixture ahead of time, preferably the night before. Ehrmann even lets the mixture age in-house for three months before using it in his Añogo. “You’ll usually get nice citrus notes, which are highlighted by the toasted orange oils sprayed on the surface,” he says. “And the sherry notes add a buttery and nutty quality.” The resulting mixture is thick, rich and comforting, and Ehrmann also provides a few alternatives for dairy-free and lower fat options. The Añogo recipe calls for 1 1/2 ounces of tequila—which would be the normal amount if serving it at a bar—but Ehrmann recommends punching that up to increase the baked agave flavors, not to mention the booziness, of the drink. If you add more than an extra half-ounce you’ll want to adjust the sherry proportions as well, adding a little more to balance the flavors and strength of the tequila. 3 Eggnog Recipes to Keep Close This Holiday Season RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'añejo tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'amontillado sherry'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'eggnog base'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: flamed orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the añejo tequila, amontillado sherry and eggnog base* into a rocks glass over ice and stir well.', 'Garnish with a flamed orange peel.']",16,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lounge-chair-afternoon/,Lounge Chair Afternoon,Liquor.com,"In general, Port is considered something to be enjoyed on its own in front of a fireplace or with dessert rather than as a cocktail ingredient. However, the fortified Portuguese wine is a worthwhile addition to any home bar , and serves plenty of purpose beyond being an after-dinner libation. Port can replace vermouth in a mixed drink or add sweetness. It can also act as the base in cocktails, bringing their alcohol content down to more quaffable levels without sacrificing body or richness. And it’s a versatile and varied category with many different styles. The director of events for Liquid Productions in Aston, Pennsylvania, Lulu Martinez pairs pink port with tequila, citrus and tarragon for a lively and botanical drink in the Lounge Chair Afternoon. “Pink port has lovely hints of fresh berries and a light natural sweetness and makes for very sessionable cocktails,” says Martinez. Straddling somewhere between a white port and a ruby, this style works with everything from gin and vodka to tequila and rum. “Port’s lower alcohol levels with vibrant flavors add a fantastic component for playing off other spirits.” For the tequila, Martinez goes with an añejo, which is a tequila that has seen a least a year in a barrel. The robustness of the tequila is tempered by the light pink port and citrus juices. Grapefruit juice is a natural pairing for tequila of any kind, and tarragon adds complexity and nuance. The end product is one you can enjoy a few glasses of without much worry of over-intoxication. Port: What It Is and How to Use It.

However, there’s more than one way to add acid to a drink, as shown by creative bartenders who are experimenting with other sources, from vinegar to DIY acid solutions. “Don’t be intimidated by using other acids,” says Vinny Starble, the head bartender at Bad Hunter in Chicago. “Get your hands on some powders, verjus , still wine, vinegar, etc., and start mixing and tasting. The more you taste how these ingredients interact with cocktails, the stronger your palate gets at understanding the base-level balance between sugar, spirit and acid.” In his Re:Birth cocktail, he uses a tartaric acid solution to balance sake and brandy with the herbaceous flavors of grappa-based chamomile liqueur and blackberry sage tea syrup. Alternative acids are cost-effective and allow for flavor expression through nontraditional methods and ingredients, increasing versatility. They also reduce the waste associated with citrus fruits like lemons and limes, in which the juice is utilized but the solids are often discarded. “There’s so much room for experimentation,” says Starble. “And if we as a community all start working with different ingredients, we can really change the way the next generation thinks about cocktails.” Alternative Acids: How and Why to Use Them in Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Kurosawa Nigori sake'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St. George pear brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Singani 63 brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Distilleria Gualco Camomila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blackberry sage tea syrup'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'tartaric acid solution'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: edible flowers', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the sake, pear brandy, Singani 63, chamomile liqueur, blackberry sage tea syrup and tartaric acid solution into a rocks glass.', 'Fill with crushed ice and swizzle until chilled.', 'Garnish with edible flowers.']",9,brandy
https://www.liquor.com/rustaveli-cocktail-recipe-4798034,Rustaveli,Liquor.com,"Mezcal, bourbon, aquavit , vodka, cachaça—many countries and parts of the world have their own signature spirit. However, few are as directly tied to a state as chacha is to its home country of Georgia. Made with pomace, the pulp remaining from pressed-off wine grapes, it’s a heady clear spirit that shares many similarities with grappa. While few bartenders and drinkers outside of the Eastern European country would have heard of the spirit, there are bars in Georgia that are now highlighting chacha in their cocktails. One such place is 41 Gradus , in the capital city of Tbilisi, and one such drink can be found there: the Rustaveli. The Rustaveli is named for famed Georgian poet Shota Rustaveli, who’s also the namesake of one of Tbilisi’s central thoroughfares. “We like to link our cocktails with some of the characters, places and events of the country, so each drink has a story to accompany it,” says Roman Milostivy, the owner and bar manager of 41 Gradus. Essentially taking a Georgian approach to a Manhattan , Milostivy uses equal parts chacha and sweet vermouth in the Rustaveli with a small pour of Cynar—an artichoke-based liqueur—standing in for the bitters and a few drops of absinthe for additional depth and complexity. Of course, in order to make the Rustaveli, you’ll need to get your hands on a bottle of chacha. This can be tricky to do, as many places in the United States and other countries don’t carry the stuff. If you do manage to find some, say on a trip to Georgia, you’ll want to make sure it’s a more flavorful, robust example of the spirit category. “We like to highlight chacha in our cocktails rather than hiding this bold spirit,” Milostivy says. “While the modern trend for production is a light-bodied distillate with less flavor, we like to use powerful and full-bodied brands.” This Georgian Bar Is Going All In on the Country’s Native Spirit RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'chacha'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet Italian vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'Cynar'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}]","['Add the chacha, sweet Italian vermouth, Cynar and absinthe into a mixing glass filled with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe.']",0,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-flannel/,Flannel,Liquor.com,"When the leaves start to change from green to gold and orange, when the winds pick up and the gray skies arrive, it’s time to switch the summery cocktails for darker, deeper and warming ones. But while hot drinks are definitely a staple of cold-weather imbibing, a drink doesn’t have to be served warm to make you feel warm. Take, for instance, the Flannel, a cold-weather cognac drink that, while served over ice, will help drive the chill from your bones like a warm flannel shirt. Cognac , a signature liquor of France, is a quintessential winter spirit because of its lush, rich qualities. The good thing about the style is that it’s hard to go wrong with a brand. You can always pick reliable names like Courvoisier, Hennessy or Rémy Martin, but whatever cognac you end up using will likely be a good choice. You can even branch into other brandies, as a number of distillers across the world have mastered the craft and produce cognac-level spirits. Or you can get really autumnal and swap cognac for an apple or pear eau de vie , though this will dramatically change the characteristics of the Flannel. The other essential winter drink ingredient is allspice dram, of which there are fewer options on shelves. The most ubiquitous label is St Elizabeth, but in recent years other distilleries, including Cotton & Reed in Washington, D.C. , have started to produce the liqueur. But what really makes the Flannel an autumnal treat is the way apple cider is included. Rather than adding the cider right into the drink as is, the cider gets reduced into a rich, sweet syrup that can be used in place of simple syrup. Besides the Flannel, it can also be used to add an autumnal touch to classics like the Bourbon Old Fashioned or Hot Toddy .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/uss-richmond-punch/,USS Richmond Punch,David Wondrich,"While I’m all about celebrating holidays with the appropriate beverages, Thanksgiving is a tough one . That November day in 1621, the Pilgrims—bless their grim, determined souls—found themselves sweating things out at the end of a very long, very thin supply line. That meant, among other things, no wine, no beer and not even any gin. (White Anglo-Saxon Protestants without gin? It doesn’t bear thinking about.) So what say we forget about celebrating 1621-style and take our next option. Abraham Lincoln made the holiday official in 1863. By then not only was there plenty of strong drink to be had, but we Americans were leading the world in the mixological arts. As proof, I offer the USS Richmond Punch—a Civil War-era concoction christened after a ship that would go on to be one of the longest-serving in the history of the Navy.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-original-sazerac/,The Original Sazerac,Kevin Gray,"New Orleans is famous for many things: Mardi Gras, beignets, gumbo, the Superdome. But perhaps nothing is more famous among drinks aficionados than the Sazerac, a classic cocktail consisting of rye whiskey, absinthe, sugar and bitters. The exact birthdate of the cocktail is elusive, and purported to be anytime between the 1830s and the late-1800s. For decades, the Sazerac was primarily a New Orleans drink, and even today, it’s regarded as the official cocktail of Louisiana. But it has proliferated during the modern cocktail era, and now it can be found in bars all over the world. Many believe that the first Sazerac called for cognac, a spirit that was prevalent in French-influenced New Orleans during the 1800s. A cognac called Sazerac-de-Forge-et-Fils was served at the original Sazerac Coffee House, and Antoine Peychaud (inventor of the cocktail’s necessary Peychaud’s bitters) was known to enjoy combining his bitters with French brandy. It’s possible that phylloxera, the 19th century vine-rotting epidemic that upended Europe’s wine trade, resulted in rye whiskey supplanting cognac in the cocktail. It’s possible that New Orleans’ residents simply substituted their preferred spirit into the drink. It’s also conceivable that Sazeracs were always made with rye whiskey, not brandy, and that well-intentioned claims to the contrary are based on incorrect intel. Regardless of the hard-to-trace history or how the potential liquor swap occurred, this much is certain: The cognac version has its charms. Distilled from grapes, cognac produces a different Sazerac than grain-based rye whiskey. While rye lends its trademark spice notes to the drink, cognac moves the flavor profile in a fruity and floral direction. Both versions are equally strong, provided that you’re using spirits of similar proof, and each allows the fiercely aromatic absinthe to shine. This recipe was shared by bartending legend Gary Regan. Try making it yourself, and see the difference. Better yet, make a couple Sazeracs side by side, one with cognac and one with rye whiskey. Only then can you crown a champion.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/new-orleans-rad/,New Orleans: #RAD,Liquor.com,"New Orleans is home to several classics cocktails, including the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz . But each year, a new crop of creative drinks springs to life at Tales of the Cocktail, the fun-loving conference that brings together thousands of industry pros and consumers for a week-long focus on bars, drinks and hospitality. Naturally, beverages are served, sometimes alongside educational seminars and sometimes at parties. The latter is where New Orleans: #RAD first appeared. The bubbly cocktail was created by New York bartender Pam Wiznitzer during her favorite moment of the annual convention. Following the last Tales event on Sunday night, the industry takes over a local bar and breaks out the sparkling rosé to the chant of “rosé all day.” Wiznitzer captured the energy of this moment with her specialty cocktail. The New Orleans: #RAD is made with cognac, St-Germain, strawberry puree and absinthe, plus a float of sparkling rosé, and it’s served in a white wine glass. The drink is fresh, fruity, effervescent and aromatic, but somehow, the best part is the garnish. That’s because the cocktail is festooned with a tiny, yellow rubber ducky — yes, the kind you’d typically find in a bathtub. If you don’t have a rubber ducky on hand, you can of course leave the garnish off, as it does not impact the drink’s flavor or aroma. But you can’t knock the visual appeal.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/absinthe-frappe/,Absinthe Frappé,Audrey Morgan,"The Absinthe Frappé may have all but disappeared during its namesake ingredient’s near-century ban, but the cocktail was once ubiquitous enough to inspire a song: In the show tune “Absinthe Frappé” from the 1904 Broadway musical It Happened in Nordland , lyricist Glen MacDonough rendered the drink in the following words: “At the first cool sip on your fevered lip / You determine to live through the day / Life’s again worthwhile as with a dawning smile / you imbibe your Absinthe Frappé!” The show premiered in New York City, but the drink itself debuted a few decades earlier in New Orleans. In 1874, bartender Cayetano Ferrer invented the cocktail—an icy mix of absinthe, anisette, and simple syrup topped off with club soda and garnished with mint—at the Old Absinthe House, where legend has it Mark Twain, Oscar Wilde, and General Robert E. Lee were fans. The Absinthe Frappé largely disappeared along with the arrival of a stateside absinthe ban in 1912. The Green Fairy, as the anise-flavored spirit is sometimes called, still has a nearly mythological reputation in the United States, due to romantic associations with Belle Époque-age artists and, more infamously, misconceptions that it causes hallucinations and madness. In reality, the production of absinthe is similar to that of gin: A high-proof neutral spirit is infused with botanicals—namely wormwood, anise, and fennel—and redistilled in a copper pot still, then reinfused with the same ingredients to give it its characteristic green hue. In 2007, the United States lifted its absinthe ban, returning the spirit to cocktail menus, which for years had subbed in Herbsaint and Pernod. The traditional way to drink it, an Absinthe Drip , calls for pouring water over a sugar cube into the spirit. But there’s a reason absinthe is often added to a cocktail in the form of a rinse: Its strong anise notes can overwhelm other flavors in a drink, and, while it won’t cause hallucinations, a higher-than-average proof of 110 to 145 can certainly cause some heady effects. The Absinthe Frappé leans more heavily on its eponymous spirit than rinsed drinks like the Sazerac and the Corpse Reviver No. 2 , but it still goes down plenty easy, thanks to simple syrup and soda water, which causes the absinthe to louche, or turn cloudy. A heaping pile of crushed ice and a mint garnish enhance the spirit’s cooling effects, and a couple dashes of the liqueur anisette both help to sweeten the drink and play off the herbaceous flavors of the absinthe. Both potent and refreshing, it just might have you believe, in MacDonough’s words, that life’s again worthwhile.

https://www.liquor.com/cotter-swizzle-cocktail-recipe-4845452,Cotter Swizzle,Tyler Zielinski,"Fish & Game, in Hudson, N.Y., which Esquire named one of the most influential restaurants of the decade , was known for its new-wave farm-to-table cooking, whole utilization techniques and fresh ingredients. Though the restaurant closed in 2020, its Cotter Swizzle cocktail lives on, epitomizing the restaurant’s low-waste philosophy through the use of a red wine vinegar made from wine past its prime. This adds bright acidity and depth to the drink, all while saving the Earth bottle by bottle. In addition to the house-made vinegar, this drink calls for fresh citrus, ginger, slightly-sweet Old Tom gin and aromatic bitters, together creating a uniquely zippy and complex flavor profile that’ll make you regret every ounce of yesteryear’s red wine poured down the drain. “The Cotter Swizzle was originally a collaboration between me and a bartender who worked at Fish & Game, Kat Dunn,” says Jori Jayne Emde, the founder of Lady Jayne’s Alchemy and former fermentation consultant for Fish & Game. “I had made some wild sumac tea, which is tart and tannic, so we played around with other additions to build a lightly sweet, tart and spiced Swizzle. Over time, I built on the drink as I was producing more and more vinegar, so I swapped out the wild sumac tea for my vinegar as it added a similar flavor to the drink.” The cocktail was named for the road Emde lives on, since its ingredients—the wild sumac and the red wine vinegar—come from there.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bebbo/,Bebbo,Liquor.com,"Ted Haigh’s book “ Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails ” has been instrumental in surfacing lost recipes and liquors since it debuted in 2004. One such recipe is the Bebbo, an obscure cocktail featuring gin, lemon juice, orange juice and honey. Not much is known about the Bebbo, but it likely descended from the Bee’s Knees , a 1920s classic containing gin, lemon juice and honey that is still popular today. Both drinks are dry and citrusy, accented by the rich taste of honey, which may have been used during Prohibition to mask the taste of subpar gin. But you don’t have to worry about low-quality gin these days: Pick your favorite London dry, and you can’t go wrong. The original Bebbo recipe called for “orange juice,” which typically means juice squeezed from the common naval orange. This version, however, uses fragrant blood orange juice, adding a sweet seasonal twist and providing its trademark deep red hue. If you’re making the cocktail during the winter and spring months (roughly December through April) when the fruit is available, give blood orange a try. Otherwise, regular OJ has you covered. Besides squeezing a lemon and pouring gin, the only task left is making the honey syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/earl-grey-marteani/,Earl Grey Marteani,Liquor.com,"Earl Grey is a consummate breakfast beverage as well as an essential part of tea time. And while it’s usually served hot, often with cream or sugar, sometimes it’s even better served chilled and in a cocktail glass with gin. This twist on the Gin Sour comes by way of one of the pioneers of the modern cocktail movement, Audrey Saunders of New York City’s famed and influential Pegu Club . In the cocktail, Earl Grey tea lends its bergamot and tannins to gin's botanicals for a drink that’s complex and layered. In the Earl Grey Marteani, Saunders uses Tanqueray gin. A widely available and popular product, Tanqueray is often seen as an exemplar of the London dry style. It also lends itself well to infusing, as its relatively high percentage of alcohol (the gin is 94.6 proof) means infusions require less steeping time. Of course, if you prefer another gin in your Gin Sour, use that. A navy-strength gin will be an even faster infusion, and a more traditional 80-proof gin will definitely work, too. Infusing with black tea lends additional bitterness in the form of tannins, the chemical compound responsible for bitterness in tea, red wine and even the oak barrels in which some spirits are aged. To mellow the acerbic bite of the gin and tea, this drink is best when made with egg whites, which add a silky mouthfeel and richness. If you are avoiding egg whites, you can achieve a similar result with aquafaba, a popular vegan alternative using the liquid from cooking or canning chickpeas.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bear-with-me-honey/,"Bear With Me, Honey",Kelly Magyarics,"A riff on a Bee’s Knees —a classic Prohibition-era cocktail—the Bear With Me, Honey comes from Morgan Stana, the bar manager at A Rake’s Bar at The Line hotel in Washington, D.C. The drink is made with Barr Hill Tom Cat gin, a gin from Vermont infused with raw honey, as well as orange liqueur, honey syrup and egg white. The sweetness of the cocktail is then balanced by the delicate acidity of verjus . It isn’t quite wine, yet verjus also isn’t grape juice as we know it. When winemakers have excess grapes on the vine that aren’t going to ripen in time for harvest, or when they want to reduce yields so the resulting grapes produce more concentrated juice, they pick the unripe fruit and immediately press it. The result is a tart elixir that isn’t drinkable on its own but one that can add acidity in a different way than citrus. “Verjus has an acidity that’s driven more on tartaric acid than on citrus acid,” Stana says. “Both make your mouth pucker and deliver that acidity that your taste buds crave, but it’s a different type of punch.” Think of it, she says, as the difference between biting into a tamarind and a lemon wedge. Verjus is a natural fit for A Rake’s Bar’s organic cocktail program, and Stana says that guests don’t seem to miss that squeeze of lemon. The staff sources their verjus from local Maryland wineries Old Westminster and Black Ankle , but for those who don’t have the luxury of heading to a Maryland winery, Stana says Navarro is a great bottled option that ships nationally. A popular choice for the orange liqueur listed in the ingredients is a triple sec—especially a good-quality one like Cointreau —but other orange liqueurs like Grand Marnier or Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao would also work very well.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/beachbums-own/,Beachbum’s Own,Liquor.com,"Jeff “Beachbum” Berry is an author and historian of Tiki drinks and the bar culture associated with them, and he’s also the owner of Latitude 29 , a Tiki-themed restaurant and bar in New Orleans. Through his books, his bar and his tireless efforts promoting Tiki and tropical drinks, he has naturally created lots of original cocktails. But this particular drink was bestowed with his own nickname. Like many Tiki drinks, Beachbum’s Own begins with a blend of different rums —in this case, a light Virgin Islands rum is paired with a richer demerara rum. You can choose your preferred bottles, but for the former, Berry suggests Cruzan, while for the latter he recommends El Dorado or Lemon Hart. The rum duo provides a complex and sturdy backbone that stands up to the other ingredients, which include a robust liqueur, citrus juices and tropical fruits. Licor 43 is a Spanish liqueur made with a proprietary recipe of 43 ingredients. It makes a natural pairing with rum, lending complementary notes of vanilla, citrus and spice. From there, Berry employs lemon and orange juices for a kick of citrus, pineapple juice for its tropical sweetness, and passion fruit puree, which adds body and its distinctive sweet-tart flavor. Mix everything together, and you get a drink that recalls warm breezes and beach sunsets.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/batida-2/,Batida,Alex Frane,"Cachaça is Brazil’s official spirit and its top-selling liquor. While it has its own category in Brazil, it is essentially a rum made with pure sugar cane, much like rhum agricole or many of the rums from Guatemala. Cachaça is even sometimes referred to as Brazilian rum and is normally sold without any aging, or aged in neutral metals, so it’s rarely seen as anything but a clear spirit. And, of course, its most famous application is mixed with sugar and lime in a Caipirinha . The Batida demonstrates that the Caipirinha doesn’t have a monopoly on cachaça drinks, though, even in Brazil. In Portuguese, the word “batida” (pronounced like BAH-chee-da) essentially means shaken or milkshake, and it also encompasses a wide range of drinks. The most defining trait of a batida is cachaça, coconut or fruit (usually passion fruit) and sugar. The cocktail also often includes some kind of condensed milk or coconut milk to make it creamy. This recipe uses passion fruit, but combines it with sugar in the form of a passion fruit syrup. The syrup from BG Reynolds —a famous line of Tiki syrups—is a reliable choice and is readily available in stores and online markets. The drink also contains coconut, in the form of coconut milk, which is richer than coconut water and leads to a creamier consistency. Fresh lime juice brightens the Batida and adds acidity to balance the syrup and coconut milk. The Batida can be made by shaking the ingredients with ice and pouring them over fresh ice, and other recipes involve blending it all and serving it as a slushy. This recipe marries the two styles, as you’ll flash-blend the ingredients first, then pour the drink over crushed or pebble ice. The result is creamy, rich, balanced and delightful. It’s a great introduction to Cachaça, and deserves its place along with the Caipirinha in the Brazilian cocktail hall of fame.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/maracuya-mistress/,Maracuya Mistress,Liquor.com,"The Ti’ Punch is a Martinique classic—essentially a rugged version of the Daiquiri or Caipirinha , it’s a simple mix of rhum agricole, lime juice and sugar built directly in the serving glass and topped with ice only if desired. T.J. Palmieri, the owner and operator of Tiki bar Madrina’s in Gainesville, Florida, puts his own spin on this classic by adding some Tiki elements. Caipirinha 449 ratings Like any good Ti’ Punch, the Maracuya Mistress starts with a rhum agricole. This funky clear spirit is a staple of the French Caribbean islands, and an essential ingredient in a Ti’ Punch and its variations—substituting another rum, even another one also made from sugarcane rather than molasses, won’t do. Palmieri uses Canne Bleue from Martinique’s Clément distillery, but you can use another rhum agricole if you prefer. Normally a Ti’ Punch is sweetened with simple syrup (or plain sugar) and brightened with lime juice, but Palmieri adds passion fruit juice and a hibiscus syrup to his drink, which brings it more in line with Tiki drinks. The hibiscus syrup can also be used in drinks like the Smoke on the Water , and the passion fruit juice has many bartending applications like the Hurricane . Whereas a traditional Ti’ Punch gets only a few ice cubes, Palmieri swizzles a whole lot of crushed ice into his, leading to a frosty, crisp and refreshing concoction. Because of this, it’s best to go with a higher proof rhum—you’ll want to use something that’s 100-proof, like the Canne Bleue, rather than an 80-proof rhum.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ti-punch/,Ti’ Punch,Liquor.com,"Ti’ Punch is the national cocktail of French Caribbean islands Martinique and Guadeloupe. Its name is an abbreviation for the Creole word “petite,” meaning small, so it translates to “small punch.” Calling for three ingredients—lime, sugar cane syrup and rhum agricole—it’s a flavorful, easygoing cocktail that’s woven into the cultural fabric of these island nations. If a Ti’ Punch is on the menu, you must begin with rhum agricole . This French term signifies rum made from fresh sugarcane juice, rather than the more common molasses, and it’s often characterized by grassy, earthy aromas and flavors. This style is native to French Caribbean islands, including Martinique and Guadeloupe. Rhum agricole works great in Daiquiris and other classic rum drinks, but it shines especially bright in the Ti’ Punch. “Ti’ Punch is part of the daily life in the French Caribbean,” says Ben Jones of Spiribam, a company that markets and distributes several Caribbean rums. “It’s not much different than espresso in Italy. Most people like it strong as a pick-me-up throughout the day.” He adds that each person has their own preferred method for preparing the drink, and it’s customary to welcome visitors with a Ti’ Punch upon arrival. Traditionally, the Ti’ Punch is neither shaken nor stirred. Instead, it’s built in the same rocks glass in which it’s served. Start by adding a lime wheel and its juice to the glass, then stir or swizzle with a teaspoon or so of sugar cane syrup until the two ingredients are combined. Finally, add the rhum agricole—typically the unaged blanc variety, but aged spirits can also work, if you prefer a drink with more depth and barrel notes. Ice is optional. Room temperature cocktails can seem unusual to drinkers who are accustomed to cold beverages, but forgoing the ice is a common practice in the French Caribbean. When made right, the cocktail’s combination of grassy rhum agricole, tart lime and aromatic, sweet sugar cane work together in perfect harmony, making the Ti’ Punch a worthy classic to be discovered by anyone who enjoys rum drinks and island sensibilities.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gangsters-paradise/,Gangster’s Paradise,Liquor.com,"Turmeric is an earthy and bitter spice that is frequently used in Asian and Southeast Asian cooking. Along with its gently spicy flavor, it’s known for adding a vibrant orange-yellow hue to dishes (it’s also responsible for coloring mustard yellow). With strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, turmeric has long been considered to have health benefits, and drinkers have caught on to all that turmeric can impart, increasingly infusing the spice into spirits and mixing it into cocktails. “It was only a few years ago that I started to get to know the flavor profile and applications of turmeric in cocktails,” says Yael Vengroff, the Los Angeles bartender and beverage director behind The Spare Room and other concepts. “One day, I was playing around with the flavor triangle of carrot, turmeric and coconut and landed on the Gangster’s Paradise. I wound up not using coconut in the cocktail but used passion fruit and cream to create this spin on a Colada.” Vengroff’s Piña Colada riff features aged rum from Barbados and spiced rum from St. Lucia, plus pineapple juice, passion fruit juice, cinnamon syrup, heavy cream and turmeric oil. It’s tart and tropical, with the rich hint of cream and the trademark earthiness of turmeric. Rather than throwing the spice directly into the shaker or dusting it on top of the drink as a garnish, she uses an equal parts mix of turmeric oil and water for a concentrated dash of flavor. 10 Turmeric Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'passion fruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'drop', 'ingredient': 'turmeric oil'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible orchid', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple fronds', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'shredded carrot', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, spiced rum, pineapple juice, heavy cream, passion fruit juice, cinnamon syrup and turmeric oil into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Pour unstrained into a hurricane glass and top with crushed ice.', 'Garnish with an edible orchid, pineapple fronds and shredded carrot.']",4,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/italian-cookie/,Italian Cookie,Liquor.com,"This rum-based drink from New Orleans’ Three Muses is an ode to the sprinkle-covered treats found in cookie tins in grandmothers’ homes everywhere. The sweet, creamy drink is best served as a nightcap or dessert cocktail, a fun birthday shot with colorful sprinkles dappling the surface. While the bar at Three Muses calls for some specific ingredients in the Italian Cookie, there is room for substitutions, starting with the base itself. The recipe calls for Black Magic Black Spiced Rum, but that may not be readily available in all markets. Kraken is a popular and affordable brand of spiced rum, as are Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and Bacardi Spiced Rum. These days, though, there are plenty of options . The Italian Cookie also calls for Herbsaint, a deeply botanical pastis flavored with anise and other herbs. Herbsaint originally grew in popularity as an alternative to absinthe, which was banned in the United States until 2007 for its alleged (and nonexistent) hallucinogenic properties . Herbsaint still sees use in drinks like the Sazerac , but can be switched out for absinthe, if desired. Similarly, while crème de noyaux is listed as an ingredient, amaretto is a suitable substitute; both liqueurs are almond flavored, though crème de noyaux has a bright red color to it. Those who do opt to use crème de noyaux can also use the red liqueur in a Pink Squirrel , another frothy-sweet concoction. One more key ingredient in the drink is fig preserves. Three Muses uses Rouses’ fig preserves at its bar, a brand from a chain of supermarkets in Louisiana. As that might be difficult for people living outside of the South to get their hands on, any line of fig preserves, or homemade ones, will do nicely. Finally, the drink is blended and then garnished with sprinkles. This enhances the similarity to the Italian cookies found in tins, also known as Italian wedding cookies. It’s certainly fun, and adds a sugary crunch to the drink, as well as some color, but it’s not 100% necessary to making the Italian Cookie.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Black Magic black spiced rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'heavy whipping cream'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Herbsaint liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/3', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de noyaux'}, {'quantity': '1/3', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'fig preserves'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'sprinkles'}]","['Blend the spiced rum, whipping cream, Herbsaint, crème de noyaux, lemon juice and fig preserves with ice in a blender.', 'Pour into a highball glass, and garnish with Italian sprinkles and a straw.']",4,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sgroppino/,Sgroppino,Liquor.com,"Italy has given us a lot over the years. Vibrant cities, picturesque countrysides and coastlines, and culture for days. Then, of course, we have all the foods and drinks, which are too numerous to count without falling into a hungry trance wherein your eyes turn into spinning plates of pasta. The point is, Italy exports some of our favorite things, including the Negroni and Aperol Spritz . Now, let’s add one more drink to that long list of good drinks: the Sgroppino, a delightful combination of prosecco, vodka and sorbet that hails from Venice and is part cocktail, part dessert. This recipe comes from Pietro Caldarelli, who created the drink during his time as beverage director at Feroce , the Italian restaurant at the Moxy Chelsea hotel in New York. He mixed the Sgroppino tableside and says making it was just about as fun as drinking one. “The cliffs of Amalfi and village[s] on water cities of Italy are about as picturesque as summer can get,” he says. “This regional Italian frozen cocktail derived from Venice is the ultimate summer refresher.” It’s hard to argue with that. Fortunately, you don’t have to be in Italy or even NYC to taste the Sgroppino because it’s simple to make at home. The drink only requires three easy-to-obtain ingredients, and you don’t even need to enlist a shaker. Combine the ingredients in a bowl, give everything a good whip until the sorbet and liquids form into a smooth, icy mixture, and pour the contents into your glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/strawberries-and-cream/,Strawberries & Cream,Liquor.com,"Sometimes, drinks aren’t highbrow affairs with rare liqueurs and botanical spirits made by mountain-dwelling monks. Sometimes, even bartenders dedicated to creating mature, thoughtful concoctions want to have a little fun. The accurately named Strawberries and Cream from New York City bartender and bar consultant Michael Waterhouse is one such exemplar, relying on the simple pleasure of strawberries, white chocolate and cream. At first glance, the gin drink is superficially similar to the Pink Squirrel , an often ignored cocktail from the 1940s. Like the Pink Squirrel, the Strawberries and Cream has both white creme de cacao and cream, though in this case half-and-half rather than heavy cream. Additionally, it’s a much stronger and more botanical drink with two full ounces of gin rather than another liqueur. With everything else going on in the drink, the gin is fairly muted, so feel free to use whatever London dry-style gin that best fits your budget and tastes. Strawberry liqueur is not a common ingredient in cocktail menus, and can potentially be hard to find on liquor store shelves. It’s especially hard to find ones that don’t rely on artificial coloring, flavoring and sweeteners. Giffard , a French label, consistently produces quality fruit liqueurs, and Fragoli is a liqueur that contains whole strawberries in it. White creme de cacao and the strawberry liqueur mimic the pleasures of white chocolate-coated strawberries, and it gets even more rich and delicious with the half-and-half. With over four ounces of liquid in it, it’s a fairly hefty-sized drink, especially after it gets shaken up and foamy. Also, with two very sweet liqueurs and half an ounce of cream, it packs a larger caloric punch than your standard cocktail. Because of this, it’s probably best to stick with just one—maybe two—at a time.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'London dry gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'strawberry liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'white creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'half-and-half'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, strawberry liqueur, white creme de cacao and half-and-half to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Martini glass.', 'Garnish with a strawberry.']",8,gin

Calvados is a brandy made from apples or pears that hails from Normandy in France, and mead —made with honey, water and yeast—is thought to be one of the oldest alcoholic beverages on earth.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pineapple-upside-down-cake/,Pineapple Upside-Down Cake,Liquor.com,"Chocolate, cake, cookies and ice cream are obvious choices when you’re craving dessert or a sugary treat, but bartenders and cocktail aficionados know there’s more than one way to satiate a sweet tooth. Well-mixed drinks are great substitutes for more classic desserts, offering a flavorful, spiked kick alongside the satisfying sweetness. This is seen in drinks from the Chocolate Martini (vodka, chocolate liqueur, creme de cacao, half-and-half) to the Grassshopper , a minty concoction that features green creme de menthe, white creme de cacao and heavy cream. Occasionally, such drinks are aimed at replicating specific desserts, like the Pineapple Upside-Down Cake. This cocktail is like the fun, eye-catching cake in liquid form. The cake itself is made with all the usual ingredients, including flour, sugar, butter, vanilla extract and baking powder, but it gets its trademark flavor from pineapple juice, pineapple slices and maraschino cherries. The cocktail version naturally skips a few of those ingredients, like the butter, eggs and flour, and it doesn’t require any time in the oven. So, it’s much easier to make, calling for only three ingredients: vanilla vodka, pineapple juice and grenadine. The flavored vodka roughly mirrors the cake, as most of the dessert’s recipes use yellow cake mix or require homemade cake batter spiked with vanilla extract. The pineapple juice is an essential ingredient in the cake as well as the drink. You can use canned juice if you prefer, but fresh always tastes best, so it’s worth the extra step to procure and then juice a pineapple. The grenadine adds its characteristic red accent, playing the part of the dessert’s bright-red maraschino cherries. Because the grenadine has a denser gravity than the pineapple juice and vodka, it floats to the bottom of the glass, creating a layered effect which again mirrors the cake’s visuals. You might get a few strange looks when you pull out of a tray of drinks and start singing happy birthday, especially if your guests were promised cake. But everyone will feel good about the decision once they taste this sweet and fruity cocktail. And, unlike when you bake a cake, your kitchen won’t be covered in flour, and you won’t have to pull out a bunch of bowls and baking tools to make drinks. It’s a win all around. 11 Pineapple Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vanilla vodka'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}]","['Add the vanilla vodka and pineapple juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Add one dash of grenadine down the side of the glass, so it slips to the bottom.']",21,vodka

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dutch-negroni-2/,Dutch Negroni,Céline Bossart,"Using genever in place of gin when making a Negroni not only brings the juniper, but also a bodied maltiness to the cocktail classic. For those unfamiliar, genever is essentially the Dutch grandfather of gin. Made from malted grain and flavored with juniper, this age-old spirit is known for its earthy, nutty qualities. New York City bartender and beverage consultant Paula Lukas elaborates: “Replacing the traditional gin in a Negroni with genever gives it a mellow, malty flavor. Genever tastes very similar to unaged whisky, and brings a certain warmth to the cocktail.” Christopher M. Gonzalez, a bartender at the Jonathan Club in Los Angeles, California, shares his perspective on genever as a Negroni base: “Genever will take you to a new place of refreshingly sweet smoothness. In combination with [smaller proportions of] Campari and sweet vermouth, you are allowing the genever to come forward and blend magically in true form,” he says. “If you want the best experience, choose your sweet vermouth wisely, and try different brands closest to your liking—there are many great classic versions and some great craft spirit brands coming out.” All in all, the use of genever here brings a roundness to this classic drink that helps to offset the signature bitterness of Campari, making the Dutch Negroni an excellent alternative for those who love this style of drink but feel it could use some softening.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cold-brew-negroni/,Cold-Brew Negroni,Alex Frane,"The Negroni is a bartender’s playground. While the original template of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth remains a masterpiece in bittersweet balance, it also offers endless opportunity for variations, tweaks and substitutions. One relatively minor change sounds strange in its description, but one sip and you’ll see why New York City bartending expert Pam Wiznitzer puts cold brew coffee into her take on the Milanese staple. Rather than adding coffee to the cocktail as a separate ingredient, Wiznitzer infuses cold brew into the crimson Campari liqueur that defines the Negroni. The infusion is versatile—a quick infusion of ten minutes will add subtle but noticeable coffee notes, but you can infuse up to 24-hours for a more robust coffee presence. A coffee-infused Negroni certainly sounds odd being that coffee and gin aren’t as commonly associated as coffee and whiskey , for instance. But the sweet silkiness of the cold brew mellows some of the Negroni’s rougher edges, and the inherent chocolate notes meld beautifully with the botanicals of the Campari and sweet vermouth.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/neighborhood-negroni/,Neighborhood Negroni,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to think of a drink that was as iconic to the so-called Cocktail Renaissance—that surge in the late 2000s when bartenders were developing new craft drinks and re-discovering old ones—as the Negroni (though admittedly the Daiquiri is a serious contender, too). The drink became almost synonymous with the craft cocktail movement for its simplicity, its iconic crimson hue and its compelling and bittersweet flavors. It grew so popular that Campari , the brand behind one of its key ingredients, even launched Negroni Week, a yearly international fundraiser that sees thousands of bars across the world featuring their own takes on the Negroni , with a portion of the profits going to charities. However, in Italy, it’s just a drink that has been enjoyed for over a century, without a lot of fanfare. Order one in a bar anywhere in Milan and you’ll receive a (often huge) glass of ice with all three ingredients quickly poured in, served, and garnished with an orange peel; no fuss, no theatrics and, almost always, no variations. One of the core premises to the drink is that it’s served like it is in Milanese cafes: over a number of ice cubes. For many Negroni enthusiasts, that ice is the fourth ingredient and fundamental to the drink. Like a Mint Julep , the drink transforms as the ice slowly melts, expressing nuances and mellowing the drink’s normally acerbic and bracing properties. However, some bartenders prefer to serve it up, as it is in the Neighborhood Negroni from famed bartender and author Tony Abou-Ganim. It might seem like a subtle, insignificant change, but it has a noticeable impact on the flavor of the drink. Serving it up in a chilled glass allows the bartender to control the exact amount of dilution the drink gets, regardless of how long the drinker lets it sit. And while there is a strong visual appeal for the more traditional, Italian style of serving it on the rocks, serving it up means you get to use a lovely vessel like a coupe or Nick & Nora glass. In his recipe, Abou-Ganim calls for Junipero gin, Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth and, of course, the obligatory Campari, each in equal part as befitting the Negroni’s golden ratio. A relatively high alcohol gin at 98.6 proof, Junipero is made in San Francisco, one of the capitals of the Cocktail Renaissance. Bold and very juniper-forward, Junipero creates a potent and assertive Negroni, even when diluted over ice and served up.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Campari and sweet vermouth to a mixing glass, fill with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled rocks glass or cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an orange wheel.']",17,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/grapefruit-negroni/,Grapefruit Negroni,Liquor.com,"The Negroni dates back to the early 20th century, when it was supposedly concocted by an Italian count in Florence. That lengthy history has provided plenty of time for bartenders to experiment with the classic recipe of equal parts gin, sweet vermouth and Campari. Some choose to sub gin for another spirit, while others incorporate different fortified wines and bitter components. Chef and bar pro Kathy Casey makes the drink her own by adding fresh ruby red grapefruit. Casey’s Grapefruit Negroni sticks with gin, sweet vermouth and Campari, but it tweaks the ratio, calling for more gin and less Campari. This adjustment yields a less bitter drink than the original. She chooses to squeeze and then drop in grapefruit wedges for a citrusy kick. You can also pour in fresh grapefruit juice, but adding the wedges lends additional grapefruit essence to the cocktail, as the peel’s oils interact with the other ingredients. Unlike the classic Negroni, which is stirred, Casey shakes this drink. That’s because it contains citrus, and conventional wisdom dictates that you stir all-spirits cocktails and shake those that feature citrus, cream, egg white and other non-liquor ingredients. The Grapefruit Negroni is an easy riff on the original with a reward that outweighs the effort.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bitter-lemon-cooler/,Bitter Lemon Cooler,Céline Bossart,"Gin and dry vermouth might seem like a familiar combination, especially for fans of the traditional Martini . Not only do these two ingredients shine together as the main event, but they also can blend seamlessly into the background as a split base in cocktails like the Bitter Lemon Cooler. Using an ounce and a half of dry vermouth and one ounce of gin, this refreshing Collins-style drink takes shape with the addition fresh lemon juice, quality grenadine and bitter lemon soda (or lemon-flavored club soda) for balance and texture. “I really love this drink as [the] gin and vermouth are just playing an intense tennis match of botanicals, with each flavor bouncing off of the other. They just make sense together,” says Jason Sorbet, beverage director of The Chloe in New Orleans. A natural companion to both, lemon—in juice and soda form—serves as the drinks brightening component, tempered by the grenadine’s complex sweetness. But, Sorbet warns, the bottled stuff never measures up to true grenadine, which includes fresh pomegranate and orange blossom water (we recommend Jeffrey Morgenthaler’s recipe ). Hemant Pathak, the head mixologist at acclaimed New York City restaurant Junoon , is also a proponent of using freshly-made grenadine over store-bought. “Fresh juice-based grenadine adds bright, crisp flavors and a vibrant color—it has a distinctive flavor that is both tart and sweet with a freshness that’s difficult to achieve in bottled grenadine,” he says. Once you’ve batched yours, use the Bitter Lemon Cooler recipe to pour yourself the perfect reward for a hard day’s work (those pomegranate seeds can be tricky).","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Bitter lemon soda or lemon-flavored club soda, to top'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dry vermouth, gin, lemon juice and grenadine to a cocktail shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Collins glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with bitter lemon soda or lemon-flavored club soda and garnish with a lemon wheel.']",11,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/baltimore-zoo/,Baltimore Zoo,Liquor.com,"The Baltimore Zoo is part of a distinct category of drink, and not the kind that would have been published in a cocktail handbook like “The Savoy Cocktail Book.” Instead, the potent, vividly red concoction belongs among august peers like the Long Island Ice Tea and the colorfully named Adios, Motherfucker . It’s the sort of libation that nascent drinkers might order at a bar in stumbling distance to their university housing—in fact, the Baltimore Zoo is said to have been invented during the mid-1990s at Purdue University in Indiana. It’s a believable origin story because the recipe—a cascade of six different spirits and liqueurs topped with, of all things, beer—smacks of collegiate immoderation. The Iconic Long Island Iced Tea 1337 ratings This drink is really only appealing to those looking to get rather inebriated rather quickly while avoiding any pesky flavors of alcohol. Though the amount of sugar in it all but guarantees a nasty hangover the next morning. For starters, there is Amaretto, a syrupy liqueur made from almonds or stone fruit pits . If that wasn’t enough to mask the flavors of the actual alcohol—namely gin, vodka and rum— it also gets peach liqueur, triple sec (skip the Cointreau this time and opt for something cheaper), grenadine and—appropriate for the mid-90s when the cocktail was likely crafted—sweet and sour mix. Nowadays, most bartenders opt for a blend of simple syrup and citrus juice (usually lime) rather than using pre-mixed sweet and sour, but if you’re set on making the Baltimore Zoo, you might as well go “classic.” One bizarre aspect of the Baltimore Zoo is that, rather than the cola that tops a Long Island or the Sprite or 7UP that finishes an AMF, it gets a glug of beer added on top. There is no specific beer style required, but in the spirit of the drink—an in an attempt to make its flavors vaguely less chaotic—using a cheap, light lager is probably the best move. Making perhaps even less sense than the beer topping is why the high-octane cocktail is named after a popular Maryland attraction, one that’s more than 600 miles from its origin at Purdue.

But for those who want to maintain the ease of crafting a simple highball while also adding some complexity to the final product, bartending veteran and educator Charlotte Voisey has a solution: infused spirits. It may seem a daunting prospect at first, more difficult than simply building a drink with some extra ingredients, but Voisey makes it surprisingly easy with two different forms of infusion: a slow-infused vodka, and a fast infused tequila. Her recipe for infused Stolichnaya vodka includes lemongrass and pears. She notes that lemongrass has a beautiful and delicate flavor that goes especially well in vodka cocktails. Chopped up coarsely with fresh pear and left to rest for a few days, it creates a bright, lightly sweet and aromatic product that only needs some soda water, lime and simple syrup to make for an impressive drink that’s a breeze to throw together. Voisey’s recipe for infused tequila is even faster and easier, but it does require some kitchen tools. Namely, it requires a soda syphon—she uses an iSi soda syphon, to which she adds some silver tequila and a fresh bunch of lemon basil, then charges it with two CO2 canisters. The result is a lightly carbonated tequila dense with lemon basil flavors. After some chilled club soda to lengthen the drink, she serves it either over ice or in a Champagne stem for some added elegance. In addition to the ease of construction, Voisey also notes that infusing the spirits this way allows you to have flavors on hand year-round that you might not have otherwise. She finds her produce at the farmers markets when it is in season, then has it for the rest of the year in the form of an infused spirit.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'infused vodka* or tequila**'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda, chilled'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon-basil leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the infused spirit, lime juice and simple syrup to a highball glass filled with ice.', 'Top with soda and stir briefly to combine.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel and fresh lemon basil leaf.', 'Add the vodka or tequila, lime juice and simple syrup to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Champagne flute.', 'Top with soda and stir briefly to combine.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/reverse-martini-bartenders-special/,Starlight Reverse Martini,Liquor.com,"There are plenty of alternatives to the tried-and-true Martini that have their own monikers, including the Vesper , Gibson and the Tuxedo No. 2 . But other times the drinks follow the “call it what it is” approach, and the Reverse Martini is one such cocktail. There are a few ways to portion the drink, but this particular Reverse Martini recipe comes from San Francisco’s now-shuttered Starlight Room; the recipe increases the dry vermouth alongside a short pour of vodka and a small addition of maraschino liqueur. Michael Lee, a certified sommelier and Starlight Room’s former assistant director of food and beverage, calls it the perfect summer drink. “It will not make you feel sluggish while you dance the night away between the stars and cable cars,” he says. If vermouth-forward Martini recipes feel antithetical to the everyday purist’s go-to ratio, that’s because it is. If you prefer yours à la Winston Churchill (“Glance at the vermouth bottle briefly while pouring the juniper distillate freely”) then steer clear of the Starlight Reverse Martini given its light vodka “base” and heavy pour of vermouth. But for those who appreciate all the nuance that a great vermouth offers, recipes such as this—and the classic 50/50 Martini , as another example—are excellent templates for exploring the underrated world of aromatized wines. One way to step up your vermouth game at home—and to improve drinks like the Reverse Martini—is to make your own blend using vermouths you already love. The reason? What one vermouth can’t do, two or more vermouths can, they say.","[{'quantity': '1 3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Dolin Blanc Vermouth de Chambéry'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'fl oz', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'brandied cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Dolin Blanc Vermouth de Chambéry, vodka and Luxardo maraschino liqueur into a mixing glass with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a speared brandied cherry.']",25,vodka

This original drink begins with gin and then calls on sweet vermouth, a French aperitif and an Italian liqueur. Together, you get a cocktail that’s similar to the classic Martinez (gin, sweet vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and bitters) but with a slightly sweeter and more herbaceous profile due to the Dubonnet rouge. Dubonnet is an aromatized wine with origins that date to 1846, when it was first created by Joseph Dubonnet, a chemist and wine merchant from Paris. It’s flavored with herbs, spices, and quinine, a key component in tonic water that has traditionally been used to combat malaria. That inclusion was by design, as Dubonnet created his elixir to make quinine more palatable to French soldiers fighting in North Africa. While Dubonnet rouge is often served over ice or simply mixed with gin, here it lends a bittersweet accent and subtle spice to the cocktail, and it merges deftly with the herbal, floral sweet vermouth and the bittersweet cherry notes of the maraschino liqueur—all without overshadowing the gin. The Kiss is relatively easy to make, so it’s a great candidate for your next romantic date night, Valentine’s Day, or even a solo nightcap. 6 French Spirits You Need for Your Home Bar RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dubonnet rouge'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Luxardo maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'apple slice fan', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Dubonnet Rouge, sweet vermouth and maraschino liqueur to a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an apple slice fan.']",14,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pour-ma-guele/,Pour Ma Guele,Liquor.com,"Nothing takes the air out of happy hour like lofty sustainability talk fogging up your Gin & Tonic , especially when the plastic straw you’re chewing on has a strong chance of becoming fish food. But these discussions are becoming more common as the bar world steadily acknowledges its impact on the environment, and bartenders are focusing on minimizing the carbon footprint associated with slinging drinks. One common practice to aid in these sustainability efforts is using ingredients that would traditionally be thrown away, as bartender Justin Lavenue does with the Pour Ma Guele. The owner of Austin bar The Roosevelt Room and its attached event space the Eleanor, Lavenue uses cassia bark and lemon peels—normally discarded after making drinks—to craft this smoked, room temperature take on a Martini variation. The Pour Ma Guele—which translates to “For My Mouth” in French—starts with Bombay gin, Dolin dry vermouth (or another good quality dry vermouth), maraschino liqueur (like Luxardo) and verjus blanc , a tart, non-alcoholic grape juice made from pressed-off wine grapes. It also gets a few dashes of orange bitters and two of absinthe—Lavenue uses St. George absinthe verte from California. In an unconventional move, the Pour Ma Guele does not get shaken or stirred over ice—instead it’s stirred together and served neat, at room temperature. To chill it slightly and add the necessary level of dilution, Lavenue adds a half ounce of icy cold water. A final element to add is the smoke, which is done by igniting the cassia bark and dried lemon peel and inverting a wine glass over the smoke, filling the glass and seasoning it. After adding the stirred cocktail, you’ll want to express lemon and grapefruit peels over the glass. In the spirit of the drink, those should then be saved for drying for future cocktails. 4 Eco-Friendly Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'water, ice cold'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'verjus blanc'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tablespoon', 'ingredient': 'cassia bark'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tbsp', 'ingredient': 'lemon peel'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: dried rosebuds', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Bombay Sapphire gin, Dolin dry vermouth, water, maraschino liqueur, verjus blanc, orange bitters and St. George absinthe verte into a mixing glass without ice and stir well.', 'In a small ramekin, combine cassia bark chips and dried lemon peel, then carefully light with a torch.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sea-breeze/,Sea Breeze,Liquor.com,"The Sea Breeze is an icon of 1980s drinking, a light and refreshing cocktail that pairs perfectly with sunny days at the beach. Featuring vodka, cranberry juice and grapefruit juice, it’s often grouped with similar drinks of the era, like the Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry) and the Bay Breeze (vodka, cranberry and pineapple). That makes sense, as the cocktails do contain a common thread among their ingredients. But the Sea Breeze enjoys a history all its own. Despite its significant ’80s street cred, the Sea Breeze likely originated decades earlier, although in a different form than it’s known today. Harry Craddock’s famed 1930 tome, “ The Savoy Cocktail Book ,” includes a recipe for the Sea Breeze Cooler, which calls for equal parts dry gin and apricot brandy, plus half a lemon and two dashes of grenadine. It’s served over ice, topped with club soda and garnished with mint. Though a much different cocktail than today’s version, many believe this to be the basis for the modern Sea Breeze. And the recipe changeup may be due to some clever marketing by a cranberry consortium. By the 1960s, Ocean Spray—originally founded as a growers’ collective in 1930—began publishing recipe booklets to promote using the tart little berries in more foods and drinks. Naturally, this push included cocktails. One particular cocktail was dubbed the Sea Breeze and featured cranberry juice, which may be the first instance of the popular drink containing cranberry. Today, the Savoy’s Sea Breeze Cooler is largely under-the-radar, supplanted by the modern vodka-spiked version. The cocktail is thirst-quenching, delicious and simple to make, so it’s easy to see why it caught on. Bottled cranberry juice continues to be the popular choice, as fresh juice is typically too tart to work by itself. But freshly squeezed grapefruit is always a good idea. Its rich citrus notes contribute to the cocktail’s restorative sensibilities and quaffability. The Sea Breeze is ready to help, whether you’re on a beach or just trying to conjure beach vibes with your drinking habits.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/very-sexy-martini/,Very Sexy Martini,Liquor.com,"There’s something inherently sexy about a drink made with sparkling rosé, especially rosé Champagne. The Very Sexy Martini leans into this, adding fresh raspberries and citrus vodka, as well as muddled mint for aromatics. The drink comes from Kim Haasarud, an experienced bartender with many years behind the stick who founded Liquid Architecture , a bar consultancy agency. Despite its name, the Very Sexy Martini is closer to a take on a Vodka Sour—like a Cosmopolitan or a Lemon Drop —than it is a Martini. A mix of muddled raspberries and mint, citrus vodka, sugar, lime juice and sparkling rosé, it’s the perfect kind of drink for Valentine’s Day or for anniversaries and other romantic occasions. However, it’s important to keep in mind that there’s no need for an excuse to make yourself something that’s a little sweet, a little boozy and plenty pink. There are plenty of options for citrus vodkas on the market, including standbys like Absolut and Ketel One, as well as newer ones like Hangar One Buddha’s Hand vodka from the San Francisco Bay Area. Whatever you might have on hand for drinks like the Lemon Drop will suit the Very Sexy Martini well. Similarly, there’s flexibility on what wine to use. Haasarud’s recipe calls for a rosé Champagne by Moët & Chandon, a big-name Champagne label with wide availability. Any rosé from the Champagne region will work, as will many other sparkling rosé wines, such as Cremant d’Alsace or Cremant de Bourgogne. US states, especially along the West Coast, have their own—often more affordable—takes on pink bubbles. Whichever you select, make sure it’s on the dry side before you add any simple syrup to the recipe, or risk an overly sweet concoction. Because the drink only calls for 1 1/2 ounces of the bubbly, it’s a smart idea to make a large batch of the Very Sexy Martini. Otherwise, you run the risk of a bottle of sparkling wine going flat. Of course, the alternative is enjoying the wine on its own, maybe starting the evening with the Very Sexy Martini and pairing the leftover wine with dinner; luckily, sparkling rosé goes with just about anything, including hard-to-pair dishes like spicy stir fries or barbecue.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'raspberries'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'citrus vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Moët & Chandon Rosé Imperial Champagne, or another comparable sparkling rosé'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'raspberry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the raspberries and mint with the simple syrup.', 'Add the vodka and lime juice, fill with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Top with the Champagne and garnish with a mint spring and a raspberry.']",62,vodka

While red wine is no stranger to some cocktail recipes, most notably drinks like Sangria or a New York Sour , seeing it mixed with vodka is uncommon. However, this Fourth of July-themed cocktail comes from the reputable mind of H. Joseph Ehrmann, the owner of San Francisco’s legendary tavern Elixir . Despite its peculiarity, this cocktail is a bright, vivid and refreshing punch that’s perfect for Independence Day but enjoyable year-round. Part of the appeal of the Red, White & Night is that it’s a breeze to make a batch while entertaining. The most important step in building it is deciding on the red wine to use. Cabernet sauvignon is what Ehrmann calls for in the recipe, but even in that there is versatility, as that grape one of the most popular grapes varieties for wine. Because of that popularity, you can choose from cheap table wines to expensive bottles that are aged for years or even decades. Seeing as you’ll be mixing the wine with vodka, lemon juice and simple syrup, you’ll want to use an affordable bottle. But don’t go too cheap. Keep in mind that the drink calls for only two ounces of cabernet, so you’ll likely end up enjoying the rest of the bottle on its own. Whatever label of cabernet you might normally enjoy with dinner should work, especially one that is brighter and juicier. The choice of vodka matters, too, of course. Similarly, you won’t want to go too inexpensive, but neither should you break the bank.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ruby-chai-appletini/,Ruby Chai Appletini,Liquor.com,"Two of the most pleasing beverages in autumn and during the colder months are apple cider and chai. Even when served cold, the spices of chai and the sweet, crisp flavors of apple have a warming effect on the body. Add some alcohol for additional warmth, and you’ve got yourself a pleasing concoction to be enjoyed year-round. The Ruby Chai Appletini comes from bartender H. Joseph Ehrmann, the owner of Elixir , a famed San Francisco bar and one of the longest continually running taverns in the whole city. Those whose minds immediately go to the sickly-sweet, electric green concoction normally referred to as an Appletini, can rest assured that, like an improved Appletini recipe , this is not one of those. Instead, it’s a double dose of chai infused into vodka and cider, with muddled apple and a bit of agave nectar for sweetness. For this recipe, Ehrmann uses Numi Ruby Chai, a popular brand of organic bagged teas that are readily available in most grocery stores. You can, of course, substitute your own favorite chai, including loose leaf and homemade varieties. Keep in mind that the spice and ginger levels can vary widely. This chai gets a bath in Square One Organic vodka, a label local to San Francisco. Given vodka’s mostly limited flavor variance, substituting another vodka should work just fine so long as it isn’t dreadfully cheap. Similarly, you can use an apple other than gala for muddling—seasonal heritage apple varieties can be delicious, especially when freshly picked from an orchard or at a farmer’s market. Even major grocery store outlets will likely have something good on hand, just be sure to grab an organic one with no wax.","[{'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'organic gala apple'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'chai-infused vodka'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'chai-infused cider'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'organic agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'apple slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the apple until the consistency of applesauce.', 'Add remaining ingredients and ice and shake for 10 seconds.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an apple slice.']",0,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/golden-geisha/,Golden Geisha,Liquor.com,"The latest healthy imbibing trend comes straight from the leaves of a prickly plant so many keep on a window sill for kitchen mishaps and post-sun relief. Aloe vera juice , by itself or infused into a spirit, is not only good for your skin, it’s also said to possess digestive-, liver- and immunity-boosting benefits. Whether or not those claims are accurate, aloe juice is an intriguing cocktail element, which Karol Ansaldi, the corporate bar manager for Groot Hospitality , puts to good use in his vodka cocktail the Golden Geisha. At Groot Hospitality bar Komodo in Miami Beach, the team makes their own aloe vera cordial—but for home bartending, it’s easiest to buy a bottle of aloe vera juice, either in stores or online. Aloe’s bitterness is best offset with strong fruity flavors like grapes, berries or citrus, Ansaldi believes, so the Golden Geisha includes a handful of fresh raspberries, as well as apple juice for additional sweetness. The aloe vera juice and lemon juice give this cocktail a deep flavor with a hint of sourness. “Considering the aloe’s healing properties, it’s supposed to represent a geisha entertaining and taking care of her guests,” Ansaldi says. Though Ansaldi uses Grey Goose vodka for his recipe, feel free to use a more affordable bottle, if you prefer. A vodka like Reyka, Tito’s or even Absolut will work well. Similarly, while it brings a fun touch of class to the cocktail, edible gold doesn’t add much in terms of flavor; omit it if you don’t want to splurge on the garnish, but keep in mind that the drink will be less glamorous and won’t live up to the name quite as well.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bramble/,Bramble,Kevin Gray,"The Bramble is one of those cocktails that feels like a century-old classic. It looks the part, and every good barkeep knows how to make one. But the drink wasn’t first invented until 1984, when Dick Bradsell (whose resume also includes the Espresso Martini ) mixed this modern-classic at Fred’s Club in London’s Soho neighborhood. It’s one of that decade’s best success stories, standing apart from the era’s provocatively named drinks that eschewed fresh ingredients in favor of bottled, neon-hued mixers. The Bramble was named for the bush that blackberries grow on and was inspired by the fresh berries that Bradsell picked as a child on the Isle of Wight. After receiving some creme de mure (a blackberry liqueur) for the bar, Bradsell began experimenting and came on a combination of gin, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup and creme de mure that was part Gin Sour and part Singapore Sling . He shook up the ingredients, then strained them over crushed ice to tame the sweetness. 11 Gin Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE There’s no reason to tweak Bradsell’s Bramble—it’s great precisely as he made it in 1984. But that hasn’t stopped inventive bartenders from playing with the recipe. The easiest way to tweak the original is to swap in a different base spirit for the gin, like a dry pisco or grassy rhum agricole, or to drizzle another product on top, like Chambord raspberry liqueur. You can also shake a couple berries with the liquid ingredients to lend more flavor and color to the cocktail. All of these variations create a fine drink, but perhaps none provide the simple refreshment that Bradsell achieved behind the bar at Fred’s Club. This recipe pays homage to the well-balanced original. Mix one during spring and summer when blackberries are in season, and throw a berry on the ice crown for visuals (and a healthy snack).

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cardamom/,Cardamom,Liquor.com,"The Espresso Martini is a modern classic that debuted in the 1980s, when London bartender Dick Bradsell mixed vodka with espresso and coffee liqueur. This polarizing drink is a popular pick-me-up at bars all over the world. Naturally, like any ubiquitous concoction, it has also spawned several variations over the years. One of the more interesting riffs is the Cardamom cocktail from Mace in New York City. Mace is named for the spice, and its drinks incorporate spices from around the globe. Bartender and co-owner Nico de Soto was inspired by the earthy flavors of cardamom when he put this Espresso Martini twist on the opening menu in 2015. It combines pistachio-fat-washed vodka with espresso and a DIY cardamom syrup. Fat washing is a technique in which liquid fat is infused in liquor. The combination is frozen, and then the solids are skimmed off, leaving behind a rich, savory spirit imbued with extra flavor. Over the years, bacon fat has been a popular choice, seen in drinks like the Bacon Old Fashioned, but any fat will do. In this case, de Soto employs pistachio oil to make a rich, pistachio-flavored vodka. And the cardamom syrup is essentially a simple syrup that combines sugar, water and cardamom pods. Those two ingredients must be made ahead, but once completed, you’ll have several servings at your disposal, giving you a lot of mileage from your effort. The only remaining step is to source some good espresso. This recipe calls for Brazilian espresso, so you might as well follow suit. Shake everything with ice, and serve in punch cups. The trio of ingredients combine to create a rich flavor and frothy head, perfect for supporting an aromatic garnish of three cardamom pods—similar to how the Espresso Martini calls for a garnish of three coffee beans. 8 Coffee Cocktails to Perk You Up RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pistachio-fat-washed vodka'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'espresso'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cardamom syrup'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cardamom pods'}]","['Add the pistachio-fat-washed vodka, espresso and cardamom syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a punch cup.', 'Garnish with 3 cardamom pods.']",11,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-coco-chanel-martini/,Coco Chanel,Liquor.com,"The word “ Martini ” can have a number of different meanings, be it a vodka Martini, gin Martini, Dirty Martini, a Gibson, ultra-dry (skip the vermouth) or super-wet (a Reverse Martini) and every permutation in-between. When it comes to choosing the base spirit for one’s Martini, most are staunchly in one of two camps: gin or vodka, and each has its own distinct influence on the drink. This cocktail, Coco Chanel, puts a whimsical, floral spin on the classic vodka Martini. It features the addition of two interesting flavor elements—coconut and elderflower—which together call for somewhat of a blank canvas, hence the use of vodka in place of gin. It’s a Martini variation that is sleek and sophisticated, like its designer namesake. 7 Vodka Cocktails That Are Perfect for Winter RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'elderflower liqueur'}]","['Add the coconut vodka and elderflower liqueur into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.']",93,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/summer-lips/,Summer Lips,Liquor.com,"There’s plenty of debate around what makes the best Martini in terms of spirit-to-vermouth ratio; there’s the old-school camp that prefers little to no vermouth, and on the complete opposite side of the field, those who prefer what’s called a Reverse Martini , when the vermouth takes center stage and is bolstered by gin or vodka. At The Recess Room in Fountain Valley, California, bartender Dany Maldonado goes even further with an incredibly busy but dangerously quaffable riff on the Reverse Martini. The Summer Lips has nine ingredients in all but deftly walks a tightrope between sweet, dry and fruity. The base of the cocktail is Lillet Blanc. Essentially a modern take on a now-lost aperitif Kina Lillet, the vermouth is best known for its inclusion in the Vesper , James Bond’s take on the Martini. Lillet Blanc is, by all accounts, sweeter and less bitter than its progenitor, lacking the quinine of the original aperitif, and it works well as the base of this drink. It gets fortified by Absolut Elyx vodka in Maldonado’s recipe, and then the drink gets a bit more complicated. Dry curaçao is a bittersweet orange liqueur, and should never be substituted with the cloyingly sweet orange curaçao from the lower shelves of the liquor store. Dolin Dry is an excellent value for an all-purpose dry vermouth that can be readily used in a more traditional Martini if the mood strikes. Aquavit brings some extra botanical notes to the party, often those of fennel, cardamom and caraway. Be sure not to use an aged aquavit, as that could potentially ruin the drink’s otherwise pristine clarity. Then chardonnay adds a bit of fruit and acid, and a bar spoon of Green Chartreuse —plus a dash of orange bitters—adds even more complexity and botanical depth. The sheer amount of ingredients does mean it’s difficult to quickly throw the Summer Lips together when entertaining, or even if making for oneself. If making multiple for friends, it’s advisable to make two or even three at a time, tripling the volume of each ingredient. If doing so, it’s also advisable to make sure to use a very large mixing glass .","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Lillet Blanc aperitif'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'aquavit'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'chardonnay'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'fl oz', 'ingredient': 'green chartreuse'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'orange bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup, balls', 'ingredient': 'melon'}]","['Add the Lillet Blanc, vodka, dry curaçao, aquavit, chardonnay, dry vermouth, green Chartreuse and orange bitters to a mixing glass with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled Nick & Nora glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/summer-fridays/,Summer Fridays,Liquor.com,"One of the primary joys of a cocktail is its transportive quality. Even in the depths of winter, sip on a drink like a Cuba Libre or a Daiquiri , and you’ll feel yourself transported to a warm island beach, maybe somewhere tropical. That’s the purpose behind this warm weather-evoking drink from bartender and author Casey Elsass, founder of Bushwick Kitchen , a company that produces hot sauces, maple syrup and honey. After all, it’s right there in the name of the drink: The Summer Fridays catches the ephemeral wonder of a Friday afternoon in summertime. To enhance this transportive quality, Elsass employs some ingredients that evoke summer but are also readily available in the cooler months. Key lime, while not as wintery as many other citrus fruits, is available throughout the fall. Coconut milk is available year round, but immediately tastes like warm weather (you can get it straight from the coconut, but generally canned versions work just great). And while the garnish is unorthodox, cilantro is often in season (year-round, in some climates) and pairs nicely with coconut milk. At first glance, the Summer Fridays bears a resemblance to a Piña Colada , but there are a few major differences. For one, vodka replaces rum, creating a drier, brighter and more austere drink. Secondly, there’s no pineapple, and rather than use coconut cream, this drink calls for straight coconut milk. Because of this, the cocktail receives some additional sweetener in the form of simple syrup, though it will still be less sweet than many other coconut drinks. Additionally, the Summer Fridays is shaken, not blended, and with coconut milk instead of cream, it’s going to be far less rich and frothy. Still, it’s no less tropical than other beach drinks, and could replace your favorite by its ease of execution and lighter, lower-calorie ingredients.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'coconut milk'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'key lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: cilantro sprigs', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, coconut milk, simple syrup and key lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with 2 sprigs of cilantro.']",6,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-barents-sea-collins/,Barents Sea Collins,Liquor.com,"The Barents Sea Collins is an interesting drink. Created by New York City bartender Jason Littrell, this highball closely resembles a Tom Collins , but it switches up the base spirit for the unexpected. Rather than rely solely on gin for the base, it’s split between vodka and aquavit. The drink gets its name from the fact that the Barents Sea separates Norway— of which aquavit is the national drink —and Russia, which is famous for its production, and consumption, of vodka. This makes the Barents Sea Collins a potable tour of the area. Because of this, it’s best to use spirits that come from those two nations: Littrell uses Linie Aquavit, a historic Norwegian brand, and Stolichnaya Vodka, arguably Russia’s most famous spirit. The draw of the Barents Sea Collins is in its simplicity and its gentle flavors. While aquavit is packed with notes of caraway and other botanicals, the Linie Aquavit is subtle in this drink amidst the vodka, lemon and simple syrup. However, the aged spirit does lend some color and nuance to the drink, while the vodka keeps things light and easy. If you want to make the highball but don’t have those particular brands on hand, feel free to experiment with your favorite vodka and aquavit. But don’t stray away from either spirit—substitute either liquor with something like gin and it won’t be the same drink. 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Aquavit RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Linie Aquavit'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Stolichnaya Vodka'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, aquavit, lemon juice and simple syrup into a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball or Collins glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Top with club soda.', 'Garnish with a lemon wedge.']",6,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/plain-killer/,Plain Killer,Liquor.com,"Sometimes, the best tropical drinks pop up in the most unexpected places. That’s how to explain the Plain Killer, a Tiki-style cocktail that comes from James Beard Award winning chef Tory Miller of The Deja Food Restaurant Group in Madison, Wisconsin. He created it at the now-shuttered pan-Asian restaurant Sujeo as a take on the classic Painkiller , which was invented in the 1970s, far away in the British Virgin Islands. The Painkiller features rum, pineapple juice, orange juice and coconut cream. Miller’s Plain Killer follows this formula, but he dials back the pineapple and switches rums. Instead of using the traditional Pusser’s Rum—a Royal Navy-style rum with notes of molasses, dried fruit and island spices—he opts to use El Dorado 15-year-old rum. (In the 1980s, the Painkiller was trademarked by Pusser’s, so if you feature a different rum, you can’t call it a Painkiller—hence the Plain Killer’s tweaked recipe and name.) El Dorado hails from Guyana, and its 15-year-old expression is full of oak, coffee, dark chocolate and rich vanilla, making this cocktail a little darker and richer than the original. The pineapple and orange juices are joined by coconut cream to round out the flavors, and a dusting of nutmeg provides aromatics with each sip. Make a Plain Killer at home to experience this BVI-inspired, Wisconsin-born drink. It will transport you to the beach, even if there’s no water in sight. 7 Amazing Fresh Juice Cocktails.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/maitai/,Smuggler’s Cove Mai Tai,Céline Bossart,"While some Mai Tai variants call for pineapple juice, this adapted 1944 Trader Vic recipe omits it for the more classic recipe favored by Martin Cate’s award-winning Tiki bar Smuggler’s Cove. Cate, a former Trader Vic’s bartender, brings some interesting perspective to the Mai Tai genre, which he details alongside the recipe on page 261 of his book, “Smuggler’s Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, and the Cult of Tiki.” Making the perfect old-school Mai Tai is far from a complicated affair. Instead, this drink is all about simplicity (according to Cate, the Mai Tai is “really just a nutty rum Margarita”). The key to bringing a balanced and robust nuttiness to your Mai Tai is using quality orgeat. Try making your own at home, or you can purchase or order the syrup from a specialty cocktail shop. As with many other cocktails, classic or not, using fresh juice is also key. To juice your limes at home, see if you can find an original Sunkist hand squeezer, which has long been the preferred Mai Tai juicing tool behind the bar at Trader Vic’s. Cate recommends searching for one of these on eBay. The major difference in using this kind of juicer instead of a modern-style hand juicer is that the lime half is hollowed out while maintaining its shape, whereas the hinge-style hand juicers of today will flip the shell inside-out. The idea here is to render a nice half-shell suitable for garnishing. Lastly, don’t shake the lime shell with the drink as it will impart unwanted bitterness. In addition, Cate advises bartenders to experiment with rums when making Mai Tais. In his words, this drink is “the perfect foil for a huge variety of rums.” He also specifies in the book that the Trader Vic’s original recipe called for 100% pot-still rum with significant age, so bear that in mind when developing your own interpretation. Fun fact: Trader Vic never served a Mai Tai with a rum float. This style was added sometime over the course of the drink’s evolution between 1944 and now. Cate notes that a Mai Tai served with a float of overproof Demerara rum is referred to as the “Old Way,” a moniker stemming from an elderly Trader Vic’s regular who preferred his Mai Tais this way.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'premium aged rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange\xa0curaçao'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orgeat'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rock candy syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, orange curaçao, lime juice, orgeat and rock candy syrup into a shaker with crushed ice and shake vigorously until the shaker is well-chilled and frosty on the outside.', 'Pour (unstrained) into a double Old Fashioned glass.', 'Garnish with a fresh mint sprig.']",69,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/caribeno/,Caribeño,Liquor.com,"When it comes to beach-side drinking, it’s hard to beat the Daiquiri , an ephemeral but lingering libation of rum, sugar and lime. However, when well-balanced, the Cuban classic can become dangerously quaffable, especially when relaxing in the sun. After an evening imbibing rum, the next morning might call out for that other perfectly tropical beverage: coconut water. Refreshing, hydrating and naturally silky sweet, coconut water is far more enjoyable than as solely a hangover cure, and in the Caribeño it’s combined with the Daiquiri for an all-in-one refreshing highball. It’s one you can enjoy for longer than a pure Daiquiri, and won’t leave you with quite the headache the next morning. The Caribeño comes from Tiki bartending legend Martin Cate , owner of Smuggler’s Cove and Whitechapel in San Francisco. Essentially a tall version of a Daiquiri, at Smuggler’s Cove it’s made with rum, coconut water and a “squeeze of lime.” You can certainly try making it that way at home, but this recipe is the more commonly held one, today.

When it comes to coconut water, use whichever brand you like, or you can always even buy a coconut and use the water stored within for an authentic experience.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pink-flamingo/,Pink Flamingo,Liquor.com,"The Pink Flamingo is an original cocktail from star bartender Jim Meehan, who created the drink in 2010 to showcase Banks 5 Island white rum, a brand he co-founded. He decided on a straightforward highball-style cocktail , pairing the rum with grapefruit soda and lime juice. At first, he made the Pink Flamingo with Ting pink grapefruit soda, a Jamaican product that complemented the Jamaican rum in Banks’ blend, but he had difficulty sourcing the ingredient as he traveled around the country. So, ever the enterprising bartender, he decided to create his own, teaming with East Imperial founder Kevin Law-Smith to make it happen. “We tasted through every grapefruit soda he could find in the world,” says Meehan. “If you look at grapefruit sodas as a category, on one end, you have Fresca and Squirt, which are sort of like grapefruit-flavored 7UP, and then on the other, you have like Izze and some of the grown-up sodas that are like faintly carbonated grapefruit juice.” They aimed to find the middle ground, making a dry soda from real fruit that still exhibited the aromatics of proper soda. East Imperial’s pink grapefruit soda launched in 2019 and is now Meehan’s go-to for topping off the Pink Flamingo. Because it has a drier flavor profile than Ting, Meehan sometimes chooses to make the cocktail without the lime juice, instead garnishing the glass with a lime wedge that can be squeezed at the drinker’s discretion. Do the same, and you can doctor the drink as you see fit. Either way you make it, the Pink Flamingo is a delicious foil to warm days, with a quaffable character that keeps you coming back for more.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mango-brava-daiquiri/,Mango Brava Daiquiri,Liquor.com,"Ask a cocktail bartender what the most perfect drink is, and there’s a pretty solid chance they will respond with, “the Daiquiri .” The reason is that while the Daiquiri is, on paper, a sour like any other—with a straightforward blend of sugar, lime and rum—when made right it’s the platonic ideal of balance in a drink. It’s sweet yet tart, boozy but refreshing, and infinitely variable for what rum (or better yet, what blend of rums ) you choose to use. With all of that praise heaped on the Daiquiri, it seems uncouth to add anything like infusions, especially after the drink spent the latter half of the 20th century being thoroughly mistreated with juices and syrups. However, no drink is sacrosanct, especially one as playful as the Daiquiri. Fruit infusions are a classic twist on the Daiquiri—most commonly, with a pineapple rum , many of which are surprisingly good. But if you’re looking to try something a little different, it can mean infusing your own spirits, like with the Mango Brava Daiquiri from drinks consultant and cocktail expert Aisha Sharpe . While many infusions call for fresh fruit, the Mango Brava deviates from the norm by using dried mango as its fruit infusion. While not quite as bright or, obviously, as fresh as it would taste if using chunks of raw mango, using dried fruit has a few advantages. The first is simply in ease of execution, as dried mango is much easier to portion out than cutting chunks off of a core. It’ll also spare you a sticky mess. The other advantage of using dried fruit of any kind in infusions is a deeper, sweeter and more robust flavor. Dried fruit is sugary concentrate, and will impart considerable flavor to the spirit in a relatively short amount of time. Rather than mango, you can also try other dried fruits: pineapple, apricot and banana would all make for interesting infusions.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'mango-infused rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the mango-infused rum, lime juice and simple syrup to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",0,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/three-dots-and-a-dash/,Three Dots & A Dash,Liquor.com,"It might not be as iconic as the Mai Tai , nor as potent and indulgent as the Zombie , but the Three Dots & A Dash is as essential drink from the classic ""Tiki"" bartending canon. Donn Beach himself, one of the two grandfathers of the style, created this drink during World War II. Its name refers to the morse code for the letter V, or Victor; more meaningfully, though, it stood for “victory” for the Allies in their fight against the Axis. Like many other drinks of the era, the original recipe has been altered and adapted over the years. This version comes from Martin Cate , owner of San Francisco’s famed Smuggler’s Cove. This recipe uses a mix of different rums—a hallmark of Tiki-style drink making—starting with rhum agricole. At Smuggler’s Cove, Cate uses AOC Martinique rhum agricole vieux, which is darker than many other rhum agricoles, along with a blended, aged rum. Mai Tai RELATED ARTICLE For the syrups, it’s a blend of St. Elizabeth allspice dram for complexity and baking spice notes, John D. Taylor’s Velvet Falernum for rich nuttiness and honey syrup for added sweetness. Fresh lime and orange juice are added for balance, with Angostura bitters rounding out the ingredients. To prepare a Three Dots & a Dash cocktail, Cate prefers a process referred to as “flash blending.” This method entails using a stand-up blender, similar to a milkshake blender, filling the mixing vessel with crushed ice and a few larger ice cubes called “agitator cubes,” and then quickly blending. The entire contents of the blender are poured straight into the glass, save for some of the larger chunks, which are strained out. Of course, as with any tropical drink, the garnish plays a significant role. The Three Dots & A Dash cocktail is garnished with three cherries on a pick, representing the three dots, and either a pineapple chunk or a pineapple frond, representing the dash. When selecting the maraschino cherries that top the drink, be sure to grab ones of decent quality like Luxardo’s cherries.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'AOC Martinique rhum agricole vieux'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blended aged rum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Velvet Falernum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'allspice dram'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'maraschino cherries'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple frond'}]","['Add the rhum agricole, blended rum, falernum, allspice dram, honey syrup, lime juice, orange juice and bitters to a drink mixer tin.', 'Fill with 12 ounces of crushed ice and 4 to 6 small “agitator” cubes.', 'Flash-blend, then pour into a footed pilsner glass, straining out any large chunks of ice, and add the garnish.', 'Garnish with three cherries on a cocktail pick and a pineapple frond.']",31,rum

The classic Gin & Tonic is a great place to start. The two-ingredient dynamo is an ideal complement to CBD’s funky notes.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cbd-dirty-martini/,CBD Dirty Martini,Janelle Lassalle,"The cocktail scene is a constantly developing one, as bartenders create, follow and build on trends. Some trends include new spirits or liqueurs, others include novel approaches to the craft, like barrel-aged cocktails or sous vide-infused drinks . One trend that rose in the later part of the 2010s was the inclusion of cannabidiol in drinks . Cannabidiol—more popularly known as CBD—is an active ingredient in cannabis. Far less regulated than THC—the other major ingredient in cannabis, and the one known for getting people “high”—CBD has no proven psychoactive effect, but has been reported by some users to decrease anxiety and relieve pain. With more and more states legalizing cannabis, CBD has been making its appearance in bars, adding both a nutty, piney flavor to the drinks as well as, reportedly, enhancing their soporific quality. One of the first—and some would argue, most polarizing—forms of CBD cocktails to emerge was the CBD float. Popularized by innovative bartenders, floating CBD oil works best when it’s paired with strong acidic and salty flavors that cut through its piney tones. The olive brine in this CBD version of a Dirty Martini does the job nicely. Of course, if you’re not a fan of the “dirty” part of a Martini, it is acceptable to add it to a traditional, olive-free Dry Martini, just keep in mind that the flavors of the CBD oil will be more pronounced with only gin and vermouth to balance it. Using raw CBD oil rather than a syrup also ensures you’re getting the maximum flavor (and any terpenes) from the CBD as it has been minimally processed or heated. The ease of adding it means it’s an easy first recipe with which to try out a CBD infusion. CBD is legal on a federal level, though some states have restrictions and prohibitions on its sales. Many states, however, have embraced it so much that oils and candies can be found at local grocery stores and markets. Other times it’s necessary to go online for it. 3 Simple CBD Cocktails Anyone Can Make FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dry gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'green olive cocktail brine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'black pepper'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'green olive', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'CBD oil', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cracked pepper', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dry gin, extra dry vermouth, green olive cocktail brine and cracked black pepper into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled Martini or coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a skewered green cocktail olive, 3 drops of CBD oil (such as House of Spain ) and a dash of cracked black pepper.']",12,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rockeys-rum-swizzle/,Rockey’s & Rum Swizzle,Céline Bossart,"Back when he was the general manager of Betony in New York City, Eamon Rockey was known for sharing his love for a largely forgotten historical cocktail: milk punch. Two years after Betony closed, he released Rockey’s Milk Punch , bringing clarified milk punch from relative obscurity to the masses yearning for a new, fun botanical liqueur. At its core, milk punch combines a spirit with citrus, tea and milk. After the milk curdles, the mixture is then strained to make clarified milk punch. The result is a silky, crystal-clear drink. Rockey’s bottled liqueur version removes all the legwork, and the possibilities for cocktail-making using it are seemingly endless. This recipe, for example, combines Rockey’s base with rum, pineapple and fresh lime juice for a refreshing swizzle likely to convert any skeptic. “The versatility of clarified milk punch is unmatched,” says wine and spirits writer and expert Shanika Hillocks. “In my opinion, Rockey’s is a sophisticated nod to BYOB because any spirit can be incorporated and all palates can enjoy it.” Depending on the cocktail’s variables, Hillocks notes that one can easily coax out a range of different flavors from the liqueur, from floral and fruity to tart citrus and soft nuttiness. In Pursuit of the Perfect Dairy-Free Milk Punch RELATED ARTICLE What’s additionally great about the Rockey’s & Rum Swizzle is that it’s built directly inside the glass—minimizing the amount of dishware to clean. According to Hillocks, the swizzle is quintessentially West Indian and is a testament to the Caribbean approach to life. “[It’s about] using what's around us and in our backyards and leveling up. It’s sustainability and local sourcing before it was a thing,” she adds. Though it’s best known as the national drink of Bermuda , the Rum Swizzle (and the Rockey’s variation thereof) is just too good to be confined to one lone island. For Hillocks, it’s all about the scenery—when asked to describe her ideal setting for sipping an ice cold Rockey’s & Rum Swizzle. “It would have to be one of my favorite places in the world—the Blue Lagoon in Portland, Jamaica.

And while any drink does the job, there is something extra tranquil about sipping a fruity, delicious cocktail adorned with an umbrella. Hold one of those, and it’s impossible to be uptight. The Ruby Relaxer fills the bill. It combines vodka, coconut rum, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, cranberry juice and grenadine into a festive package that’s a little sweet, a little tart and a lot of fun. The vodka provides a mostly neutral base for the other ingredients to build on, allowing the tropical flavors of coconut, peach and pineapple to shine, while the modest measures of cranberry and grenadine keep the sweetness in check. Note that store-bought grenadine can work in a pinch, and it’s certainly the easiest way to go, but the homemade version lends more flavor and texture to your drinks without the addition of artificial ingredients. With just a few minutes of work, you can produce a DIY pomegranate grenadine that will be much more delicious than any of the bright-red commercial options you’ll find in a bottle.

It’s believed that the Blue Lagoon was created by Andy MacElhone, the son of famed bartender Harry MacElhone, at Harry’s New York Bar in Paris in the 1960s or early 1970s. So, the drink predates the 1980 movie of the same name. Vodka provides a sturdy base, while the blue curaçao—a Caribbean liqueur made using the dried peel of the Laraha citrus fruit and then colored blue—adds sweet, zesty notes. The lemonade lengthens the drink, lends additional tartness and keeps the beverage quaffable. This recipe involves shaking and then straining the liquid, which is the preferred method when making the drink. However, some people choose to blend the ingredients with crushed ice to whir together a frozen cocktail. The shaken route is easier, faster and delicious, so don’t hesitate to keep things simple.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/port-royal-punch/,Port Royal Punch,Liquor.com,"The history of punch is long and complex, with different areas of the world having produced their own takes on what would eventually be called punch. According to cocktail historian and writer David Wondrich —whose book “ Punch, The Delights (and Dangers) of the Flowing Bowl ” investigates the history of the drink—punch began as a beverage enjoyed by British sailors. Originally, it was made with arrack, a rum from South Asia made with sugarcane or fermented coconut sugar. Sweetener, citrus juice, spices, and water were also added to the concoction. In time, the recipe evolved into a whole range of drinks, though the general format remained—usually a dark spirit like rum, brandy or whiskey is mixed with citrus or other fruit juices, some kind of sweetener, often a wine and sometimes tea. The Port Royal Punch, on the other hand, borrows from the modern idea of a “fruit punch,” as it uses a considerable amount of juice. And rather than, say, sparkling wine, its carbonation comes from that ubiquitous citrus soda: Sprite. A bit of grenadine makes the punch even sweeter, though using a homemade grenadine will keep it from being too cloying. Unlike a recipe from Wondrich’s book on punch, the Port Royal would be more likely found at a college party or a club than it would be on the bar of a cocktail lounge. Spiced rum, pineapple and mango juice, Sprite and grenadine are uncommon in modern craft cocktails. However, if you’re hosting a party for friends who like a sweet drink, one that hides its alcoholic content amongst fruit juices and sodas, and one you’re more in danger of contracting a sugar high over than getting too drunk from, then it’s sure to be a party pleaser. One of the key aspects to punch is its presentation, and the most obvious element is the punch bowl itself. These days, it’s easy to find ornate examples both online and at vintage shops. While you can use a regular mixing bowl, besides its underwhelming appearance compared to an ornate vessel, it’s difficult to find one that accommodates the volume of the Port Royal Punch. The other alternative is a large pitcher, and again, it’s an opportunity to get ornate. The other key ingredient for both presentation and flavor is ice . There’s always bagged ice from convenience stores, but in order to take it to the next level visually, and to keep the punch from getting diluted soon after serving, try freezing a massive ice cube using a large storage container or a mixing bowl. That will ensure much slower melting, and give the punch bowl a nicer look.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '750-milliliter bottle', 'ingredient': 'Captain Morgan spiced rum'}, {'quantity': '96', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '24', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'mango juice'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Sprite'}, {'quantity': '4 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'oranges'}]","['Combine the spiced rum, pineapple juice, mango juice, Sprite, grenadine and orange slices in a punch bowl and stir to combine.', 'Serve in punch glasses filled with ice.']",18,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mutual-friend/,Mutual Friend,Liquor.com,"At Hell or High Water in Louisville, Kentucky, Doug Petry crafts drinks using local purveyors like Quills Coffee and has a deft hand with rum. Take the Mutual Friend, a showcase of Plantation five-year-old rum and Galliano ristretto espresso liqueur , given a tart, bright contrast with lime and pineapple. At first glance, a blend of rum, espresso and pineapple seems a bit chaotic. However, made with a careful hand this drink manages to create a well-balanced and complex marriage of tropical flavors. The espresso aspect comes from the Galliano ristretto. This coffee liqueur is a major departure for Galliano, which is associated with the classic yellow-hued, anise-flavored liquor that floats atop vodka and orange juice, changing it from a Screwdriver to a Harvey Wallbanger . The ristretto taps into the inherent Italian expertise in making espresso, and—unlike many other coffee liqueurs on the market—uses multiple kinds of coffee beans in a complex, multi-stage process. Its flavor profile is distinct enough that it’s difficult to substitute another coffee liqueur in the Mutual Friend. Like many rum-based drinks, the cocktail uses a blend of different rums, in this case Plantation Barbados five-year old and Ron Zacapa 23-year-old . The Ron Zacapa has a dedicated fan base, though it has come under criticism for both the ambiguity of its age statement , as well as allegations of undisclosed added sugar. While it’s hard to find an accurate replacement for its gentle sweetness and nuanced caramel notes, the drink only calls for half an ounce, so substituting another rum is doable. Plantation five-year-old is a fantastic rum for cocktails, reasonably priced around $35 normally and robust enough to stand up in drinks. It also drinks just lovely on its own or with a bit of ice. Petry’s recipe calls for a dry-shake to fully incorporate all the ingredients without watering the drink down. It is then poured over pebble ice. While many bars, especially those with Tiki programs, have machines that can make pebble ice, most people making this at home are going to have to find it in stores. If that’s too much, crushed ice—from an ice maker or crushed by hand—fills in fine.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Plantation Barbados five-year-old rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ron Zacapa 23-year-old rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Galliano ristretto espresso liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demerara simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple leaf', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'espresso beans', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all the ingredients into a shaker and dry-shake (no ice).', 'Pour into a rocks glass filled with pebble ice.', 'Garnish with a pineapple leaf and 3 espresso beans.']",0,rum

It adds weight and structure without overpowering the other ingredients. Cointreau is most famous for its use in the Margarita , but it can be employed wherever one desires a kick of orange. Maraschino liqueur isn’t like the bright-red cherries you find on ice cream sundaes. Instead, it’s bittersweet and sometimes nutty, adding a tart cherry flavor to cocktails. Rounding out the alcohol is a small measure of pear liqueur for additional fruit notes. This recipe calls for a dash of grenadine, which is easy to accomplish with any store-bought bottle. But it’s worth taking the extra step and making your own grenadine by combining pomegranate juice, sugar, pomegranate molasses and orange flower water. Mix a batch in a few minutes, and you’ll have rich, flavorful, deep-red grenadine at your disposal for this drink and any others. Like all cocktails, the Beach Bum can be consumed anywhere—day or night, summer or winter. But drink this on an actual beach, and you’ll level-up your vacation. 20 Vodka Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pear liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, Cointreau, maraschino liqueur and pear liqueur into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with a dash of grenadine.', 'Garnish with fresh mint leaves.']",19,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rum-rangoon/,Rum Rangoon,Liquor.com,"The Rum Rangoon is a flavorful cocktail created by bartending vet Jim Meehan . Drink one, and it’s like being transported on an instant Caribbean vacation. The beach and breeze are missing, but the tropical vibes are still strong. To make the drink, Meehan begins with Banks 5-Island Rum, a blend of three-to-five-year-old rums from five different islands: Trinidad, Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana and Java. It’s rich and complex, despite its clear color, and makes a great base in cocktails. From there, he enlists Clément Creole shrubb, fresh lime juice, Martinique sugar cane syrup, aromatic bitters and orange bitters. That Creole shrubb is an orange liqueur made from a blend of aged and unaged French Caribbean rums, which are macerated with sun-dried orange peels and Caribbean spices. It’s richer, spicier and more complex than many other orange liqueurs on the market, so it does particularly magical things in cocktails, especially those made with rum. The Martinique sugar cane syrup is a bottled product that’s exactly what it sounds like: a sweet syrup made from Martinique sugar cane. It’s popular in drinks like the Ti’ Punch (rhum agricole, lime and sugar) but is versatile enough to work in a variety of tropical-leaning drinks. If you can’t find this particular sweetener, you can always use simple syrup , which is easy to make at home by combining equal parts sugar and water. Add the lime juice for balance and the bitters for an extra dose of structure and flavor, and you’ll channel the Caribbean with each sip. 20 Rum Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Clément Creole shrubb'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sugar cane syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, Creole shrubb, lime juice, sugar cane syrup, Angostura bitters and orange bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with an orange wedge.']",4,rum

If that isn’t feasible, head to the liquor store and procure everything you need to recreate the sensation of an island paradise. You can do that with the Jamaican Breeze, an original recipe from bartender and brand ambassador Willy Shine. The cocktail begins as many great tropical drinks begin—with rum. In this case, Shine chooses Appleton Estate Reserve, an eight-year-old Jamaican rum with aromas of fruit and oak and flavors of honey, vanilla, holiday spices and orange peel. He pairs the rum with pineapple juice, ginger, simple syrup and Angostura bitters—ingredients that, when combined, create the ideal mix of island refreshment. The ginger is muddled in the shaker to release a fresh kick of heat that complements the rich rum and sweet pineapple. Shake everything up, take a sip, and you can practically feel the sea air on your face. You might not be on vacation: Your home kitchen surroundings should tip you off to that.

The latter combines honey, butter and spices and is one of the many flavor-bomb concoctions dreamed up by the legendary Donn Beach of Don the Beachcomber. Donn Beach was a Tiki pioneer. He opened his famed bar in Los Angeles in the 1930s, which helped to popularize Tiki culture around the country. During his tenure behind the bar, he is credited with inventing many classic drinks that are still enjoyed today, including the Zombie , and he also workshopped several DIY syrups and mixers, like his eponymous gardenia mix, to give his recipes extra flavor and flair. The modern interest in Don’s Gardenia Mix, however, is largely owed to another Tiki luminary: Jeff “Beachbum” Berry. He resuscitated the mostly forgotten mix and the Pearl Diver cocktail, which prominently features it, back in 2006. Making Don’s Gardenia Mix requires an electric mixer or a sturdy hand. Whip together honey, unsalted butter, cinnamon syrup, allspice liqueur and vanilla syrup in a bowl until smooth.

It features a flavorful combo of dark rum, Campari, lime, pineapple and demerara syrup, and since its debut, said Bird has become a Tiki favorite served in bars around the world. This, however, is the Roman Holiday, a riff on the Jungle Bird that hails from Cindy’s , the beloved rooftop bar on top of the Chicago Athletic Association Hotel. It’s an updated take on the original that skips the rum entirely and instead calls for Amaro Meletti, a bittersweet Italian liqueur made with botanicals including anise, clove, gentian, orange peel, saffron and violet flower. The floral and caramel-like flavors provide a flavorful base for the other ingredients to play on. Campari, another Italian liqueur, is used sparingly at just a quarter ounce, but it still shines through with its trademark notes of bitter orange. From there, the Roman Holiday features fresh pineapple and lime juices, demerara syrup and cold-brew coffee, so there’s a lot going on. The drink is a deft balancing act between bitter and sweet, and the coffee imbues the whole thing with a vein of rich coffee flavor. A pinch of salt allows all of the ingredients to pop, while a cinnamon stick garnish provides a pleasant aroma with each sip.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/emerald-isle-of-the-caribbean/,Emerald Isle of the Caribbean,Liquor.com,"Most people, when picturing a Tiki drink, imagine something like a Mai Tai or a Hurricane ; crushed, pebbly ice is a hallmark of the Tiki tiki craft, often mounded up like boozy snow cones atop drinks. They evoke the luxury of resting on a tropical beach or, perhaps more accurately, a beach in California or Florida. On the opposite side of the drink spectrum to Tiki craft is the Irish Coffee . A consummate winter drink, this warming elixir combines whiskey, sugar and coffee with a garnish of whipped or heavy cream. But with the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean bartender Paul McGee manages to combine the disparate elements of each drink into one, with rum and Tiki syrups mixed with dark roast coffee for a lush, dark, dreamy libation. The drink is named for the British Overseas Territory of Montserrat, which gets its nickname from its location and its similarity to Ireland’s shape as well as many of its people’s Irish ancestry. McGee uses El Dorado Special Reserve 15-year-old-rum for it; despite its age, it’s on the affordable side, which makes it a nice rum for both including in cocktails and for enjoying over ice or neat. A house made cinnamon syrup, velvet falernum, and Don’s Spices #2 give the drink its sweetness and herbal complexity. For the Don’s, McGee uses B.G. Reynolds , a popular brand of Tiki syrups from bartender Blair Reynolds of Portland, Oregon . It wouldn’t be a take on an Irish coffee without some fluffy whipped cream to finish it off. Rather than going with a simple cream chantilly, McGee makes a Tiki whipped cream, with St. Elizabeth allspice dram, Angostura bitters and demerara sugar.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cowboy-coffee/,Cowboy Coffee,Liquor.com,"Coffee and cocktails are two of life’s great joys. One picks you up in the morning, and the other kicks off your night. Usually. In other instances, coffee may be employed after dinner, while a cocktail works its magic during the day’s early hours. However you like to enjoy these drinks, there’s no denying the synergy that occurs when the two are joined in one glass. Coffee cocktails include old-school classics like the Irish Coffee , modern-classics like the Espresso Martini and a slew of contemporary creations, including the Cowboy Coffee. The latter is an original recipe from Denver bar pro Sean Kenyon that calls for crushed coffee beans, Colorado whiskey, demerara syrup and Angostura bitters, plus a two-pronged garnish of a coffee bean and a lemon twist. It’s all served in a flute, but don’t let the package fool you: This drink is strong enough for even the most grizzled cattle-driver. The Cowboy Coffee is similar to an Old Fashioned , as both feature whiskey, sugar and bitters. In this case, Kenyon uses Stranahan’s, an American single malt that features notes of cinnamon, caramel, vanilla, chocolate and oak. The recipe swerves from the classic Old Fashioned by imbuing the liquid with the punch of muddled coffee beans. Those beans are crushed in the shaker, and then shaken with the liquid ingredients for a quick flavor infusion. When making the drink at home, be sure to enlist a fine-strainer to remove the gritty, broken beans, so you’re left with smooth sips. Coffee beans are caffeinated, but by limiting the recipe to two muddled beans, rather than a pour of brewed coffee or espresso, the cocktail contains a low dose of caffeine. This makes the Cowboy Coffee a good option for anyone who wants that coffee flavor without the jitters.

That’s probably not a question you’ve often asked yourself (or your favorite bartender), but it’s one that bartending expert and gin creator Simon Ford decided to answer anyway. Ford created the White Bat for a Pernod Ricard event, and while he’s most well known for his background in gin , here he uses a white rum to craft a bubbly and decadent nightcap. Any white rum will do the trick, and you can even mix things up and us something darker, like an amber rum or even a blackstrap. But the Kahlúa is integral and should not be substituted. Together they serve as a rich base, made even richer with the addition of whole milk—you could use a non-dairy substitute if need be, but it won’t have the same body or mouthfeel if you do. To heighten the sweetness and bring some fun bubbles, Ford adds a few ounces of cola. He doesn’t specify a brand, but you’ll want to avoid the big name brands that use corn syrup and artificial sweeteners and flavors. Mexican Coca-Cola, which uses real sugar, is a great option, but there are plenty of smaller craft cola companies now that you can easily find something good. As for its name, the White Bat, that origin has been lost. “For the life of me, I can’t remember why we gave it that name,” Ford says. “Though at the time I remember it being something quite clever.” In any case, his creation is on the sweeter side, but it makes for a perfect after-dinner libation. 7 White Russian Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'white rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Kahlúa'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cola, chilled'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whole milk'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: mint leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the white rum, Kahlúa, cola and whole milk to a highball glass filled with ice and stir briefly and gently to combine.', 'Garnish with mint leaves.']",21,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/nightcap/,Nightcap,Liquor.com,"While the Gin & Tonic is one of the most ubiquitous highball drinks, tonic doesn’t tend to be paired with many other spirits, save vodka. Espresso & Tonic, though, is a time-honored mix, and the bittersweet soda blends lovingly with spirits other than gin or vodka, including rum. “A Rum & Tonic is like the two friends you have and you can’t figure out why they’re so close until you really spend time with them,” says Daniel Moik, a bartender and rum expert in Hamilton, Bermuda. As a self-professed coffee geek, Moik has had his fair share of Espresso & Tonics. The refreshing, caffeinated beverage acted as the starting point for the Nightcap, which sees the addition of rum and syrup to add some kick and sweetness. The rum, a gold rum from Goslings, has notes of butterscotch and vanilla but finishes dry. Maple syrup adds sweetness, Angostura bitters lend complexity, and orange zest matches the tonic’s citrus notes. While Goslings is primarily known for its black strap rum that is the base for a proper Dark ’n Stormy , the Nightcap calls for the Gold Seal, a newer expression. Brighter and softer than the Black Strap, the Bermudian rum pairs with the gentle bittersweetness of the cold-brew coffee. Grade A maple syrup is another necessary ingredient in the drink. Harvested earlier in the season, grade A indicates a lighter amber color. Grade B refers to a darker, more robust syrup, which could potentially overwhelm in the Nightcap. Moik uses San Pellegrino tonic water in his highball, but any high-quality tonic water will serve well in the drink, just be sure to taste for your flavor profile preference. Despite its name (a nightcap is generally a soothing cocktail, the last drink of the night after a big dinner or in front of a warm fire), this Nightcap is more an energy booster than a soporific. “This drink is a great summertime pick-me-up as the sun is setting and you need that little boost to keep the party going,” Moik says.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Goslings Gold Seal\xa0rum'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'cold-brew coffee'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grade A\xa0maple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura\xa0bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'San Pellegrino tonic water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, cold-brew, maple syrup, orange zest and bitters to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball glass over large ice cubes.', 'Top with the tonic and stir gently.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",19,rum

Ray Burns, the owner of Prohibition in Charleston and Savannah, says there’s never a wrong time of year to drink an Irish Coffee, but it’s especially perfect for winter sipping. His take on the classic begins with all the usual ingredients (whiskey, coffee, sugar and cream) but then takes a unique departure. “As Irishmen, we take our Irish Coffee very seriously. The Gran Rosta Coffee has become one of our signature drinks at both Prohibition locations,” Burns says of the drink, which derives its name from the Gaelic words for “popcorn.” There’s a reason for that name. “The secret ingredient is a sprinkling of popcorn powder on top.” The garnish lends a buttery, salty flair to the rich and warming drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/midnight-oil/,Midnight Oil,Liquor.com,"Outside of a Spanish or Irish Coffee , caffeinated beverages in cocktails may seem like a strange concept, especially for cold drinks. The rising popularity of cold brew, however, sees more marriages between coffee and spirits of all kinds. One such spirit that lends itself to mixing with coffee comes from the same part of the world: rum. Add to that another tropical fruit, the banana, and you have an unconventional yet delicious drink that tastes like a boozy breakfast in a glass. “The Midnight Oil brings to life in cocktail form one of my all-time favorite snack combos: a morning coffee and a slice or two of banana bread,” says bartender Brett Esler of Whisler’s in Austin, the creator of the Midnight Oil. “With an aged rum base, a touch of Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur for a little depth and some vanilla extract to round it out, you have yourself a slightly caffeinated, fall-driven sipper.” For the aged rum, Esler opts for Mount Gay Black Barrel ; while its name may spark some confusion, the rum is golden, not blackstrap like the rum in a Dark ’n Stormy . Robust, bold and smooth, it’s an elegant Barbados rum for use in both cocktails and for drinking neat. If substituting, be sure to use an aged rum of similar quality rather than opting for a lower shelf variety. Esler also uses Stumptown cold-brew coffee. The lauded coffee company from Portland, Oregon, now sells its bottled cold brew nationwide, as well as online, which makes it an easy ingredient to find. However, those who want to use a different brand, or who feel compelled to make their own, should feel free to play. Two of the other ingredients in the drink are less flexible. While there are other ginger liqueurs, Domaine de Canton is by far the most well-known and its flavor is particular, so switching it for another product would alter the drink. Similarly, while there are a few banana liqueurs on the market, many of them are cloying and artificial, unlike Giffard Banane du Brésil liqueur, which sees macerated bananas from Brazil mixed with a touch of cognac.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/italian-chocolate-martini/,Italian Espresso Martini,Liquor.com,"Coffee cocktails aren’t just for brunch anymore. Besides being a conduit for caffeine, coffee is full of oils and rich flavors that pair nicely with a variety of spirits and liqueurs, from whiskey and rum to bittersweet amari. So, to explore the depths of coffee as a cocktail ingredient , bartenders across the country are reaching for drip coffee, espresso, cold-brew and even coffee syrups to enliven their drinks. Nicholas Boden is one such bartender. He invented this bittersweet, Italian take on the classic Espresso Martini for his bar at Tavernonna Italian Kitchen at the Hotel Phillips in Kansas City, Missouri. The most obvious change to the recipe is the omission of a base spirit—normally, the Espresso Martini is made with vodka, but Boden’s version is more like a slightly boozy espresso shot. In it, espresso is enhanced with an amaro and Kahlúa, creating a rich, botanical and dark drink with as much caffeine as it has alcohol, if not more. For the amaro, Boden uses Amaro Averna , a century-plus-old liqueur from Sicily that is popular amongst cocktail bartenders for its use in drinks. Unlike some other amari, it’s gentle and reserved, good for sipping after dinner but also for mixing with ingredients like sherry, whiskey and rum. Its subtle but present citrus notes pair nicely with bittersweet espresso, especially when sweetened. For the sweet element, Boden uses Kahlúa liqueur. A natural fit for any coffee drink, given that it’s made with coffee itself, Kahlúa shows up in a number of well-known drinks including the White Russian and, most notably, the original recipe for an Espresso Martini. However, with only half an ounce used in this recipe, the amount of added caffeine is negligible, especially considering how much is already in the espresso.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/coffee-and-ti/,Coffee & Ti’,Liquor.com,"The Ti’ Punch is the national cocktail of Martinique and features just three ingredients: rhum agricole, sugar and lime. Rhum agricole is the French term for rum made from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses, and the style is native to French Caribbean islands, including Martinique and Guadalupe. It’s a necessary component in the cocktail, as a true Ti’ Punch can’t be made without it. But bartenders have still been able to create their own takes on the classic recipe by incorporating different syrups, fruits and liqueurs. One such example comes from Nick Detrich of Cane & Table in New Orleans. His Coffee & Ti’ takes two liberties with the original recipe: It calls for a 10-year-old rhum agricole (the classic usually features unaged spirit) and adds coffee amaro to the mix. The aged rhum agricole lends a richer and deeper flavor to the drink, plus notes of cinnamon and vanilla, while still showcasing fresh sugarcane. And the coffee amaro, which comes from Kansas City, has a bittersweet, herbal profile with notes of cardamom, gentian, orange peel and star anise. Put it all together, and you’ve got a unique Ti’ Punch—not as bright and sugarcane-forward than the original, but still featuring rhum agricole as the star of the show. Ice is optional in the Ti’ Punch, and it’s not used at all in the Coffee & Ti’. That can feel unusual for drinkers who are accustomed to cold cocktails, but it’s a traditional practice in the French Caribbean. The ingredients are flavorful and merge together with harmony, so ice or not, the resulting cocktail is a true treat.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/java-the-hutt/,Java the Hutt,Liquor.com,"Cocktail inspiration can come from anywhere, including songs , Broadway plays and, of course, the most legendary science-fantasy franchise in American history: Star Wars . Now, the repulsive, slug-like crime boss Jabba the Hutt isn’t the most obvious source of inspiration—nothing about him or the frog-like creatures he eats raw are especially appetite or thirst-inducing. And bartender Chris Cheng of Westroot Tavern in San Diego professes a distaste for puns. But nevertheless, the two things come together in the Java the Hutt, as Cheng couldn’t resist employing some wordplay for this decadent cocktail made with horchata vodka and cold-brew coffee. As his city is home to an installment of the world’s biggest fantasy fest, San Diego Comic-Con , it’s only fitting that Cheng was ready to whip up this Hutt-inspired cocktail. The drink starts with vodka made right in San Diego by Cutwater Fugu . In particular, Cheng uses the brand’s unique horchata-flavored vodka, an homage to the city’s stellar Mexican cuisine and the popular beverage to pair with it. There are not many competitors in the style, so you’re best off using the brand called for. This slightly sweet vodka pairs beautifully with coffee, and so the drink also gets two full ounces of cold-brew, which is nearly as caffeinated as espresso. After one or two Java the Hutts, you’ll be moving quite a bit faster than any Tatooine slug gangster. To continue with the iced coffee flavors, the drink also gets a measure of half-and-half (though you can substitute a non-dairy equivalent if desired), simple syrup for sweetness and white creme de cacao to give it a touch of white chocolate latte flavor. It’s finished with a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. George Lucas has not, as of yet, confirmed whether or not Jabba would drink a white chocolate horchata latte, with or without alcohol, but regardless, it leads to a delicious and creamy drink.

But instead of heading to the usual coffee shop chain for an overly sweet version, use the slow-cooker recipe by bartender Norma Beekman of Lexington, Kentucky’s Lockbox at 21c Museum Hotel Lexington . Hers is better because it has booze in it, and you can follow her lead to make your own delicious pumpkin spiced latte at home. The drink stays hot in the pot, so you can serve it morning, noon and night. And for the boozy kick, you can spike it with a variety of spirits, such as dark rum , bourbon or even nutty Frangelico (when considering your spirit, darker is best, so skip the clear stuff). Rum and bourbon dial up the potency, while Frangelico comes in at a more delicate 40 proof, about half the octane of most full-strength spirits.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/shoulda-benne-pirate/,Shoulda Benne Pirate,Liquor.com,"This sweet, locally inspired coffee drink is like a dessert in a glass, and makes for a lovely after-dinner treat that offers a bit of a buzz beyond the alcohol. The Shoulda Benne Pirate comes from Harold’s Cabin in Charleston, South Carolina, a historic market, bar and restaurant that has existed in some form or another since the 1920s. The cocktail, too, is rooted in history, as it takes a crumble of benne seed wafers, a South Carolina low country staple, for a unique, crunchy garnish. The dessert is toasted benne seed—otherwise known as sesame seeds—on a thin caramel wafer. Salted, toasty and crisp, the cookies can be hard to find outside of South Carolina, but if you’re intent on authenticity, you can always order some online or try your hand at baking some yourself. Otherwise, some thin sesame wafers can fill in. Similarly, the base spirit for the cocktail is rooted in South Carolina, as Harold’s Cabin infuses fresh strawberries into Striped Pig rum. Founded as Charleston’s first distillery since prohibition, Striped Pig is renowned for its sustainability , with such efforts including sourcing local sugarcane for its rum. However, its availability is mostly limited to the Palmetto State, so those who want to make the Shoulda Benne Pirate but can’t get their hands on the real deal can substitute another high quality white rum; after the strawberry infusion, it shouldn’t taste dramatically different. Some cold brew coffee, either homemade or bought, Baileys Irish Cream, simple syrup and egg white finish the drink. The egg white gives it a creamy, silky mouthfeel that accentuates its richness without adding additional sugar. For those who want to make it a night cap, feel free to swap the cold brew for a decaf blend; the Bailey’s has a negligible amount of caffeine.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/prairie-buzz/,Prairie Buzz,Liquor.com,"Coffee cocktails aren’t only for brunch. Besides being a conduit for caffeine, coffee (at least the high-quality stuff) is full of oils and rich flavors that pair nicely with a variety of spirits and liqueurs, including whiskey and vermouth. The ideal nightcap for the coffee-inclined, the combination of cold-brew, chinato and cream in this cocktail from the Bennett in New York City is a perfect balance of caffeinated zip and herbal calm. There’s a lot going on in the Prairie Buzz, which starts with Rieger’s Kansas City Whiskey , a blend of bourbon, corn whiskey, rye and a small measure of aged oloroso sherry. For the coffee aspect, it calls for a half-ounce of cold-brew, which is all the caffeine you’ll need, considering its strength. The sweetness in the drink mostly comes from amaretto —a rich liqueur made with either almonds or stone fruit pits—though it also gets a scant amount of cinnamon syrup. Vino chinato, an Italian grape-based aperitif similar to a sweet vermouth, adds more botanicals and complexity, which is mellowed by the addition of heavy cream. You could play around with cream substitutes, if you don’t normally consume dairy but still want to try the Prairie Buzz. This rich, herbal and creamy drink is an excellent and flavorful nightcap, though you might want to use decaffeinated cold-brew if you’re planning on turning in soon after enjoying the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/flaming-dr-pepper-shot/,Flaming Dr. Pepper,Liquor.com,"The Flaming Dr. Pepper is a college rite of passage. Despite the name, Dr. Pepper and its Texas-born, 23-flavor recipe is not one of the drink’s ingredients. But the fiery mix of sweet amaretto liqueur, bubbly beer and overproof rum simulate the iconic soft drink remarkably well. Like many popular cocktails, the Flaming Dr. Pepper shot has competing origin stories. The Ptarmigan Club in Bryan, Texas (located near Texas A&M University), and the Gold Mine Saloon in New Orleans both claim to have invented it in the 1980s. It’s difficult to imagine such a unique drink appearing around the same time, in two different places, but so it goes sometimes with cocktail lore. Flaming cocktails and shots require an overproof spirit for the brightest pyrotechnic flair. High-proof rum, absinthe and grain alcohol like Everclear can all do the trick. But in the case of the Flaming Dr. Pepper, a dose of potent rum helps the drink achieve its distinct flavor, so that is the preferred choice. Acclaimed bartender and gin-maker Simon Ford provides this recipe and notes that the Flaming Dr. Pepper is one of his favorite guilty pleasure drinks . To make it, you simply add amaretto to a shot glass, top that with overproof rum and light the liquid on fire. Carefully drop the two-part shot into a pint glass half-filled with beer to extinguish the flame, and drink up. It is customary to consume the contents quickly, as this isn’t what you’d call a sipping cocktail. Easy as it may be to assemble, the Flaming Dr. Pepper is one drink that’s perhaps best left to the professionals. If you do choose to make it yourself, watch your eyebrows and stash a fire extinguisher nearby. Nothing ruins a good party faster than a blaze.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sangrita/,Sangrita,Alex Frane,"If you ever drank tequila in college or other time in youth, chances are you enjoyed it as a shooter, quickly downed after licking some salt and then followed by biting into a lime wedge. As you aged, maybe you learned to appreciate the nuances, complexities and depths of the famous Mexican agave spirit, and instead took to drinking it neat, sipping it like you would a fine whiskey or brandy. If so, you can still find a tradition attached to drinking tequila, and that is accompanying it with Sangrita. This non-alcoholic tomato and citrus-based drink has nothing to do with Sangria , despite their names being similar and both being related to “bloody.” Instead, it’s closer to a Bloody Mary , minus the vodka and with a lot more citrus. Like the Bloody Mary, no two recipes are exactly alike , and some differ wildly. Some versions of Sangrita omit the tomato in exchange for more citrus, while others include cucumber, papaya, mango or other fruits. Usually there’s some kind of heat, with hot sauce, fresh peppers or both. And while it was relatively unknown outside of the Mexican state of Jalisco for many years, in recent times the popularity of Sangrita has spread, and you can even find bottled versions of it on store shelves and online markets. However, nothing compares to making it fresh yourself. This particular recipe comes from San Francisco bartender and cocktail consultant Jacques Bezuidenhout. Bezuidenhout likes his Sangrita citrusy, tomatoey and with some pepperiness from both hot sauce (he uses Cholula or Tabasco brands) and fresh jalapeño peppers. It will keep for about a week in the refrigerator, though it’s going to be best right after you make it or the following day. Once you have it, it will transform the way you taste tequila. “You’ll have a little sip of tequila, and you’ll have a little sip of Sangrita. It’s one of the best ways to enjoy your favorite tequila,” Bezuidenhout says.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/b-52/,B-52,Liquor.com,"The B-52 is a popular, eye-catching shot composed of three liqueurs: Baileys Irish cream, Grand Marnier and coffee liqueur . The drink’s origin is not completely clear, but rather than being named for the 1950s-built B-52 bomber, it is believed to have originated during the 1970s by a bartender and fan of the iconic band The B-52s. Why the B-52 Works While some shots are shaken with ice and strained, the B-52 is made by adding each element directly to the shot glass. Since there’s no ice, many bartenders choose to keep the ingredients refrigerated, so they—and the drink itself—can be served cold. The shot’s intricate appearance is belied by its very simple construction, in which the ingredients are layered in the glass in order of most dense to least dense. In this case, the sweet and syrupy coffee liqueur goes on the bottom, followed by the Baileys and then the Grand Marnier, which is the lightest of the three. Pouring the liquids slowly over a bar spoon will help them settle on top of each other to achieve the desired look. Over the years, bartenders have created many layered B-52-style drinks that riff on the original and either add or replace the primary ingredients. In the B-53, Sambuca replaces the Irish cream, while the B-54 subs amaretto for the orange liqueur. But the most common variation is the Flaming B-52, a risky endeavor in which the top layer of the shot is set on fire. In this variation, drinkers will often top the drink with a dash of overproof rum or another high-proof spirit that easily ignites. Making a round of perfectly layered B-52 shots is a proven method for livening up parties. It’s hard to resist the sweet combination of coffee liqueur, Irish cream and Grand Marnier. The shot looks good, goes down easily and is usually followed by calls for another round.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/chocomole/,Chocomole,Liquor.com,"Spicy Mexican chocolate is a delicious treat, enjoyable anytime of the year either hot or, less commonly, cold. Generally, it includes cocoa, sugar, cinnamon, pepper and, of course, milk, and its gentle spice and warmth compliments the creamy chocolate. But how can one make it even more enjoyable, especially as a night cap or dessert after a delicious Mexican meal? By adding Mexico’s most famous liquor, of course: Tequila . The Chocomole goes a bit further, though, with a special homemade chocolate and spice mixture that gives the drink its name and a unique flavor profile, making it like a spicy, chilled take on a Boozy Hot Chocolate . The Chocomole comes from Tippling Bros, a bartending consultation group from bartending veterans Tad Carducci and Paul Tanguay. Most of the work for the drink is in the assembling of the chocomole mixture, a creamy, slightly peppery blend of spices, condensed milk, Mexican hot chocolate mix and peanut butter. Almost all of the ingredients can be found in the average United States cupboard: cinnamon, cumin, chile and oregano are cooking essentials in many households. The ingredients that might require a trip to the nearby grocer are the evaporated milk and the Mexican hot chocolate blend: Tippling Bros call for Nestle Abuelita Mexican hot chocolate mix. However, if you prefer using another company’s blend (or if you make your own), feel free to do so. Once you’ve got the chocomole mixture finished, it’s only a matter of adding the reposado tequila of your choice as well as a little agave nectar for added sweetness. Unlike Mexican hot chocolate, this drink is served cold in a shot glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/snap-crackle-drop/,"Snap, Crackle, Drop",Liquor.com,"There’s something about the ritual of taking a tequila shot. Load up a shot glass with some of the agave spirit, salt a wetted portion of your hand, and firmly grip a lime wedge in the other hand. Lick the salt, shoot the tequila in one go, and then bite down on the lime. It’s an intense, delicious sensation, going from salty to the earthy pungency of tequila to the bright acid of the lime. And while it tends to be relegated more towards college parties and youthful indiscretion, it’s still a time-honored tradition even for adults. But that doesn’t mean it can’t receive an upgrade, especially when that upgrade comes from an experienced, professional bartender like the legendary Salvatore Calabrese. A bartender, spirits advocate, bar consultant and author, Calabrese has published more than a dozen books on bartending and cocktails and even created his own lines of spirits. So he can generally be treated as a reliable source for all things bar-related. With the Snap, Crackle, Drop, he takes on the tequila shot with a zesty upgrade. The main change to the classic tequila shot combination is swapping out the traditional salt for a heady, enlivening mixture of Angostura bitters and freshly ground black pepper. Calabrese makes a paste of sorts out of the mixture of the two and then applies it to fresh lime wedges. Rather than licking the salt, shooting the tequila and biting the lime, he encourages the drinker to take bites of the peppery, bitters-coated lime in between sips of tequila to really enjoy the full process, rather than downing it in one go. Of course, even more so than in a cocktail like a Margarita or Paloma , the quality of the Snap, Crackle, Drop relies almost entirely on the choice of tequila. This is not a place for bottom-shelf spirits. For his recipe, Calabrese suggests Don Julio Reposado Tequila. A premium spirit, the aged tequila ranges around $50 to $70 a bottle, depending on the market. Since its flavors are being enhanced and magnified by the drink, it’s a great tequila to use. It’s also a greater encouragement to not shoot the whole thing .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hot-shot/,Hot Shot,Liquor.com,"Layered shots are a bit of a relic. Once the height of cocktail fashion (or at least rather trendy sometime around the 1990s), they’ve faded into relative unpopularity save for the occasional club or party. There’s nothing inherently wrong with layering ingredients rather than mixing them, and doing so can create an impressive image—a fun trick that will wow people with your skills. The Hot Shot is once such layered drink, an Italian-inspired, caffeinated concoction. The Hot Shot relies on the quality of its espresso, first and foremost. Using pre-ground, store-bought coffee beans won’t lead to the best tasting version of the drink. Instead it’s best to buy from a local coffee shop or roaster and grind the beans yourself. It’s also not advisable to buy an espresso shot from a cafe and make the drink with that, as it will quickly lose its crema, not to mention its heat. However, if you do not have an espresso maker but still are still keen on making the Hot Shot, be sure to move quickly. And order your espresso as close as possible to when you make the drink. The only liquor in the Hot Shot is Galliano, an Italian herbal liqueur with heavy notes of anise and vanilla. If you have a bottle sitting around for the Hot Shot, it’s probably because you bought it to make the liqueur’s most famous progeny, the Harvey Wallbanger . If you don’t manage to finish the bottle with the Hot Shot, there are other applications . Finally, the drink is topped with a float of heavy cream. If you're making this drink for someone who doesn’t partake in dairy products, or for whatever reason you don’t want to use cream, you can substitute an alternative like almond milk or soy milk. But keep in mind that with less fat the alternate milk will likely not float as well, and could potentially mar the sleek, layered appearance. When it comes to that layered look, it’s not as difficult as it might initially seem. The most effective technique is to use a pour spout and gently and slowly pour the liquid down the back of a bar spoon held just over the surface of the previous layer. After a bit of practice, you should be building layered shots easily and breezily—all the better to impress your guests. What the #$@! Do I Do with This? Galliano: What It Is and How to Use It.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tea-for-two/,Tea for Two,Liquor.com,"Tea for Two is an original cocktail from Amy Wong, who created it while working as the lead bartender at King Tide Fish & Shell in Portland, Oregon. It’s her take on the Philadelphia Fish House Punch , a classic drink containing rum, cognac and peach brandy. Wong begins her punch in a similar fashion, with Jamaican rum, cognac and peach schnapps. The schnapps adds sweetness and fruitiness to the mixture. “Peach schnapps pairs best with fruit-forward spirits,” she says. “Vodkas won’t fight the flavors of [it], but it’s not as dimensioned and wouldn’t be my first choice.” The punch also calls for brewed black tea (unlike water, it’s a great way to add dilution without sacrificing flavor), plus lemon juice and lemon oleo saccharum . The latter sounds intimidating but is actually quite easy to make. You simply muddle lemon peels with sugar and let the combination sit, so the peel’s citrus oils leach into the sugar. After a few hours, you’re left with a rich and lemony sweetener.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sparkling-rose-margarita/,Sparkling Rosé Margarita,Liquor.com,"The Margarita is an essential summer cocktail, right up there with the Mojito , Mint Julep and Daiquiri . Its iconic balance of sweet and tart and boozy is perfect for those warm summer afternoons in the sun. And while its pure form—that of tequila, lime, triple sec and sugar—is pretty much untouchable, the template lends itself well to playful variations, twists, and additions. One popular variation on the Margarita is the Strawberry Basil Margarita , when the drink is enhanced with the spicy-sweet vegetal notes of basil and the fruitiness of strawberries. This bright pink libation is a signature drink of beach-time fun and garden parties, especially when made properly—mainly by not using a cloying, artificial mixer in place of real fruit and fresh herbs. However, it can be punched up even more with another summertime staple: rosé. In particular, sparkling rosé. One immediate concern might be that adding sparkling rosé will make the drink sweet. And sure, if you opt for a bottom-shelf supermarket bottle of pink bubbly, you run that risk. But sparkling rosé from all over—including France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, North and South America and even Australia and New Zealand—can be bone-dry. Of course, the fruit doesn’t need to be strawberries, though they are some of the easiest to work with and pair beautifully with the basil. Raspberries are an obvious substitution and can bring even more tartness and vivid color. Blueberries add a darker, juicier element and will still work well with sparkling rosé. Even tropical fruits like star fruit and mango will work well provided they are in season. Just be sure to taste for sweetness and adjust accordingly, remembering that while you can always add sugar (in this case, in the form of agave syrup), it’s much trickier to remove it. With the serving bowl, there’s no need to get too fancy, especially if you’re planning on taking this somewhere like, say, a beach or friend’s barbecue. With a sparkling rosé-topped berry margarita, it’s doubtful anyone will even notice the vessel.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/point-reyes-punch/,Point Reyes Punch,Liquor.com,"There’s something about the elegance of an equal-parts cocktail , whether that’s the bittersweet charm of a Negroni , the bright and herbal notes of a Corpse Reviver No. 2 or the balanced and nuanced Point Reyes Punch. This creative concoction comes from bar veteran Claire Sprouse, founder of New York City’s famed (and now-closed) Hunky Dory. In it, pineapple syrup lends a silky thread to a sunny blend of rum and dry vermouth. The base spirit for the cocktail is a white rum, and any dry white rum will do. Something like Plantation 3 Star, Flor de Cana 4 Year Extra Seco or even Bacardi Superior will do the trick. What’s more specific is the vermouth that is called for—Sprouse constructed the Point Reyes Punch with Lo-Fi Dry Vermouth. This fortified wine from northern California producer Lo-Fi Brand Aperitifs is slightly sweeter than your average dry vermouth and is made with a variety of herbs including fennel, coriander, and chamomile. It can be found through online markets, and can be used to make a unique Martini or Spritz . Another unusual ingredient in the Point Reyes Punch is the syrup; rather than using a sweet liqueur like the maraschino in a Last Word or the orange liqueur in a Corpse Reviver No. 2, Sprouse makes a pineapple syrup from scratch.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/canadian-punch/,Canadian Punch,David Wondrich,"Canada’s most prominent contribution to the history of mixology is the Bloody Caesar , a Clamato-fueled variation on the Bloody Mary discovered, or at least popularized, by bartender Walter Chell at the Calgary Inn in Alberta. In addition, there’s the Canadian Cocktail offered by New York bartender Hugo Ensslin in his 1916 “Recipes for Mixed Drinks”: orange Curaçao, dashed with Jamaican rum and lemon juice. That one made it into the iconic “ Savoy Cocktail Book ,” so some people have actually heard of it. Beyond that, there was a Toronto with whisky and Fernet-Branca, and a Vancouver with gin, dry vermouth and Benedictine, both of which had a bit of traction back in the 1930s. Plus, we can’t forget the still-omnipresent (in Canada, anyway) Rye and Ginger . Not a poor tipple in the bunch, yet none of them could really be said to stand in the top rank of mixed drinks—although I like a Caesar or three every now and then, and that Vancouver ain’t bad. Reaching further into the dark backward of time, however, we pull out one Canadian—or perhaps “Canadian”—elixir that is not only delicious but also fits perfectly with the low-key, sensible charm of our northern neighbor, all without using gimmicks like splashing maple syrup everywhere. That drink is Canadian Punch, a strong, simple and ridiculously tasty potion that appears in both Jerry Thomas ’ seminal 1862 “The Bon Vivant’s Companion” and the 1869 “Steward & Barkeeper’s Manual,” published by Jesse Haney & Co., respectively the first and second extant cocktail books in America. I don’t know what its actual connection to Canada is, if any. (It may, for all we know, have been christened after the Canadian River, which flows southeast from Colorado and ends up somewhere in Oklahoma.)

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/fish-house-punch/,Fish House Punch,David Wondrich,"We’ve all heard of people seceding because of a desire for liberty, a deep political grievance or a sense of ethnic solidarity. Understandable, if sometimes wrongheaded or unwise. But what about seceding just for fun? That’s what happened on May 1, 1732, when a bunch of prosperous Quakers from Philadelphia, the chief settlement of the Pennsylvania Colony, leased a little property from the Lenni-Lenape tribe. There, on the banks of the Schuylkill River a few miles upstream from the city, they built a clubhouse—a castle, they called it—and promptly declared themselves the Colony in Schuylkill, an independent entity with its own governor, lieutenant governor, councilmen, coroner and sheriff. In 1782, in keeping with the times, the group shook off ""Colony” and became the State in Schuylkill. It has had to move a couple times since, but as far as one can tell (its affairs are kept very quiet), the club is still going strong in its current castle, just outside Philadelphia on the Delaware. The purpose of all this political business? Fishing. Well, that and barbecuing. And, of course, drinking. In the 18th century, it was customary for a gentlemen’s social organization of this character to carouse a fair bit. The fuel for this carousing was invariably a large bowl of punch . Every club had its own version, most of which have been lost to history. But not the recipe the State in Schuylkill always served at its “Fish House,” as the castle was informally named. Since at least 1794 (the earliest mention we have of it), the concoction has been pretty much the same: lemon juice, sugar, rum, cognac and old-school peach brandy—a high-proof, dry, barrel-aged brandy distilled from peaches, as opposed to a sticky-sweet peach-flavored liqueur. There’s a reason for this longevity: Fish House Punch is one of the most pleasant inebriants known to science. Definitely worth seceding over. 9 Perfect Punch Recipes for a Serious Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '8', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemons'}, {'quantity': '2 1/2', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'demerara sugar'}, {'quantity': '16', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'boiling water'}, {'quantity': '750', 'unit': 'milliliters', 'ingredient': 'Smith & Cross traditional Jamaica rum (or other strong Jamaican)'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'V.S.O.P cognac'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'peach brandy'}, {'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '16', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['At least a day ahead, fill a 2-quart bowl with water and freeze until completely solid.', 'In a large punch bowl, muddle the peels from 8 lemons with the sugar.', 'Let the mixture stand for at least 3 hours.', 'Add the boiling water, stirring until as much as possible of the sugar has dissolved.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/super-sunday-punch-bowl-of-freedom/,Super Sunday Punch,Liquor.com,"Whether you’re watching football, baseball or basketball, a good punch pairs nicely with friends and sports. If that punch is spiked with bourbon and apple brandy, even better. The Super Sunday Punch comes from Chicago bartender Mike Ryan, who calls upon two classic American spirits to lead the way: Laird’s apple brandy from New Jersey and 100-proof bottled-in-bond bourbon. Simply choose your favorite bottle for the latter. Those strong, flavorful spirits get a helping hand from cloves, allspice and cinnamon sticks, giving this punch a seasonal bent for the busy roster of fall sports. From there, Ryan enlists ruby red grapefruit juice, honey and sweet tea, which combine to lengthen and sweeten the drink while also providing a welcome dose of citrus. One great reason to make punch is that you can assemble it ahead of time and break it out right before your party, leaving you free to occupy yourself with other activities before your guests arrive. In that case, simply refrigerate the punch and add the ice just before serving. Apple slices are used to garnish the punch bowl and may also be applied to individual glasses for a decorative touch (and tasty snack). With a large batch of punch on hand, you can quickly serve your guests or let them serve themselves. That way, you don’t have to play bartender all night, and instead you’re free to enjoy the game. 7 Great Batched Cocktails for Your Next Party RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '25', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'whole cloves'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon sticks'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'whole allspice'}, {'quantity': '750', 'unit': 'mL bottle', 'ingredient': '100-proof bourbon'}, {'quantity': '750', 'unit': 'mL bottle', 'ingredient': 'Laird’s apple brandy'}, {'quantity': '25', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'ruby red grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '25', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'honey'}, {'quantity': '10', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'sweet tea'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: apple, cored and sliced', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Wrap the cloves, cinnamon sticks, and allspice in cheesecloth, tie into a bundle and place in a punch bowl.', 'Add the remaining ingredients and stir thoroughly.', 'Fill with large ice cubes, stir and garnish with apple slices.']",12,bourbon

When it comes to the latter, there are usually ice-cold cans involved. But for those looking for a large-format cocktail to go with the large-format event, Game Day Sangria is the answer. “Being a lower-ABV drink, Sangria is great for day drinking during a game,” says Laura Newman, who co-owns and co-manages Queen’s Park and Neon Moon alongside partner Larry Townley in Birmingham, Alabama. “It lends itself to batching, so if you’re hosting a group you can spend more time entertaining your guests—and watching the game—instead of making tons of cocktails.” Besides, it would almost be weird to make a single-serving Sangria—while we can’t pinpoint the exact origin of this internationally-beloved punch, we do know that it’s been around for centuries and has generally been served to a crowd. The term “game day” can refer to a variety of different sports throughout the year, and although the Game Day Sangria recipe features flavors associated most closely with the fall season (read: football season), apple is an ingredient that shines all year long. And, according to Townley, pairing it with ginger is always a sound decision. “Apple and ginger is a classic flavor combo that’s crisp and invigorating,” he shares, adding that while this balanced Sangria recipe keeps the sweetness in check, you can always add a bit of simple syrup to taste. “It’s a sessionable cocktail that you can enjoy responsibly throughout the game.” Plus, Newman adds, it’s a great option for beginners thanks to its quick and easy build. 9 Perfect Punch Recipes for a Serious Party RELATED ARTICLE Cocktails that are this simple and straightforward in their build often serve as a great canvas for experimentation. The virtues of this Sangria in its natural low-alcohol form are plentiful, but for those who prefer theirs with a more spirited base, you can easily fortify it using a number of different liquors—many traditional recipes call for brandy, which helps in creating complexity and will generally amplify fruity notes. Vodka , for example, will increase ABV without imparting any distinct flavor, and rum (in its many different forms) is known to incorporate notes like vanilla, brown sugar, dried fruits and baking spices while adding to the drink’s depth. At the end of the day, most recipes can be tweaked to your liking, but the Game Day Sangria is a particularly great template with lots of room for customization.

With proper balance, it’s a showstopper of a drink, the perfect cocktail to bring out at your next get-together with friends or to impress someone with on a first date. Furthermore, its low-to-no-proof status means you can enjoy this all evening without worrying about a headache the next day. The H2O Highball is a finicky drink, however, and messing things up can disturb more than just the flavor profile. For instance, when selecting the small-batch spring water that serves as the base of the drink, it is crucial to select one with a strict 2-to-1 hydrogen-to-oxygen ratio. While ingredients like simple syrup are forgiving with their proportions, changing the water to, say, a 2-to-2 ratio could result in a very different sparkling drink, though one that is useful at disinfecting wounds. If you’re in an area where small-batch spring water can be hard to find on store shelves, substitutions include bringing a bucketful of water from a local spring or creek, or just pouring water from your tap. There is some flexibility in the recipe, and exceptions can be made to parts of it. For those who want something a little stronger, try substituting the six ounces of water for two ounces of vodka, bourbon, rum, tequila, scotch or any other hard spirit, then switch out the watermelon garnish for some citrus fruit of your choosing. Or, omit the soda entirely and enjoy said spirit neat or over ice, with a bar spoon of distilled water to help the flavors open. While the H2O Highball Cocktail is enjoyable year round, it’s best in springtime, especially early April. In fact, it’s generally best enjoyed on April Fool’s Day. Or just anytime you’re compelled to put in a lot of extra work for an iced club soda.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/golden-glove/,Golden Glove,Liquor.com,"Cuba is responsible for many classic cocktails, including the Mojito and Daiquiri . But there’s one drink that has stayed hidden in the shadows of these heavy-hitters, only popping up in old recipe books and at the bars of rum fanatics and drinks historians. The Golden Glove can be traced back to the “Bar La Florida” recipe booklet, which was published in 1935 by Constante Ribalaigua Vert , owner of the Floridita bar in Havana. The watering hole is famous for serving venerable regulars like Ernest Hemingway and for turning out some of the best drinks in Havana. That includes the Golden Glove. Consisting of rum, lime juice, sugar and Cointreau, it’s like a Daiquiri-Margarita hybrid. But Ribalaigua, a boxing fan, actually fashioned the cocktail as a riff on his Daiquiri No. 2, which featured orange liqueur and orange juice in addition to the trifecta of rum, lime and sugar. The Golden Glove is easy to like, combining familiar flavors into a drink that is strong, refreshing and citrusy. It tastes great whether consumed on a sunny isle or at your local bar. And given the easy-to-obtain ingredients, you can also make this cocktail at home. The below recipe comes from distiller and cocktail expert Allen Katz. He suggests using Flor de Caña 4-Year-Old Extra Dry, a lightly aged rum that’s been filtered clear. That’s a fine starting point, but you can experiment to find the rum you like best. This recipe also calls for shaking the drink and straining it over crushed ice into a rocks glass, but Ribalaigua was known to blend his with ice and pour the frosty mixture into a cocktail glass. Whichever path you take, you get to drink a Golden Glove, so don’t overthink it—instead, enjoy this taste of Cuba’s rich cocktail history. 6 Cuban Cocktails for Drinking Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime half-wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, Cointreau, lime juice and sugar into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over fresh crushed ice.', 'Garnish with a lime half-wheel.']",14,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/la-estrella/,La Estrella,Liquor.com,"La Estrella is a spicy and sweet cocktail from New York bartender Phil Ward, who’s best known for his time at pioneering bars Death & Co. and Mayahuel, and for concocting modern classics like the Oaxaca Old Fashioned . To make this fruit-forward elixir, he starts by muddling sugar cubes with club soda and watermelon. Muddling is a cocktail technique employed in a diverse bunch of drinks, including the Mojito and Whiskey Smash . It’s a great way to break down fruits and herbs, release flavors and infuse one ingredient into another. Ward uses Flor de Caña 4-year-old rum from Nicaragua as the base spirit in the cocktail, pairing it with rum’s favorite partner, fresh lime juice. A pinch of cayenne goes straight into the shaker, lending a hint of spice to the liquid ingredients. Rum, lime juice and sugar are the three tenets of the classic Daiquiri, so you can consider La Estrella a Daiquiri riff . But with the watermelon and cayenne, it has a flavor all its own. Once the cocktail is stirred and strained, it’s topped with club soda, which gives each sip a refreshing kick of bubbles. Finally, a pineapple-and-strawberry garnish provides a finishing flourish to this delicious drink. 11 Watermelon Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'sugar cubes'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'club soda'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'chunks', 'ingredient': 'seedless watermelon'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'cayenne pepper'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry half', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a mixing glass, muddle the sugar cubes and 1 ounce of club soda until the sugar is dissolved.', 'Add the watermelon pieces and muddle again.', 'Add the rum, lime juice and cayenne pepper, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a large snifter over one large ice cube.', 'Top with the remaining 2 ounces of club soda.', 'Garnish with a pineapple slice and a strawberry.']",6,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tokyo-tea/,Tokyo Tea,Liquor.com,"The Tokyo Tea is a twist on the famous (some would say notorious) Long Island Iced Tea . The Tokyo version isn’t named for where it was invented; rather, the drink is distinguished from its American cousin by its signature green color, which is delivered courtesy of melon liqueur. The world’s most popular melon liqueur is Midori, which hails from Japan and is made from neutral grain spirits, Japanese muskmelons and the cantaloupe-like yubari fruit. At only a half ounce, and combined in equal portions with the other ingredients, the melon liqueur’s flavor and color still shine through and play a starring role in this cocktail. The drink also receives a topper of club soda, rather than the LIIT’s customary cola. The Tokyo Tea recipe calls for sweet-and-sour mix. This is easy to find on store shelves, but if you’re up for an additional step, you can quickly make your own by adding fresh lime juice to simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water). This way, you know exactly what’s going into your drink. The same cannot be said for bottled mixers, which are often loaded with fake sugar and additives. Of course, no one orders the six-spirit Tokyo Tea for health reasons. Or for the nuance. Or even for accuracy (there’s no tea in the glass). And still, somehow, this mishmash of disparate ingredients just works. It’s sweet, boozy and dangerously quaffable—somehow, all that liquor seems to mask the liquor flavor—making it the ultimate party drink, whether you’re barhopping in Ginza or entertaining friends at home.

Combining vodka with ginger beer and lime, it’s refreshing, delicious and endlessly customizable, spurring an entire category of other Mules containing everything from whiskey and rum to mezcal. This particular Mule leans on the drink’s ability to accommodate different spirits, and it adds fruity flair to the recipe with peach schnapps. “I enjoy sweet liqueurs in something that has a little spice, such as a Mule with fresh ginger and soda,” says Jeremy Allen, the general manager of MiniBar in Los Angeles. “Peach schnapps is surprisingly versatile, and you can use almost any liquor as the base,” he says. Any base spirit would work well, but he prefers dark rum, vodka, tequila, mezcal or gin with his Mule. Allen also doubles up the ginger, combining ginger juice with ginger beer to bring additional spice to the cocktail. You can juice fresh ginger root if you’d like (and if you have a juicer), or you can follow Allen’s lead and purchase a high-quality bottle of ginger juice from the store. Then play with the base spirit to see how this drink changes. Vodka keeps the flavor focused on the ginger, while gin adds its trademark dry botanical profile. Dark rum brings oak and molasses, tequila adds vegetal earth and pepper to the mix, and mezcal adds a hint of smoke.

This two-ingredient drink combines gin and lemonade, a duo that you can rely on any time of year, but one that’s especially helpful when the mercury begins rising during the hot summer months. If you’re wondering about the cocktail’s origin, well, there’s no elaborate backstory. “London” refers to the drink’s base spirit, as gin is closely associated with the U.K. (If you really want to stay on theme, use a London dry gin.) But the real key here is to use freshly squeezed lemons for the lemonade. That will add the desired tartness and rich citrus kick you want. Of course, if you’re pressed for time, store-bought lemonade can be a handy substitute. Gin is the classic choice for this cocktail, but that doesn’t mean you can’t experiment. Want to make it with vodka? Now you’ve got a Russian Lemonade. Prefer bourbon? Great, mix yourself a Southern Lemonade.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/death-star-2/,Death Star,Alex Frane,"Life may be all sunshine and Disney magic in Orlando, but at Greek restaurant Taverna Opa , bartender Alex Attart likes to take a walk on the dark side of life. Here, his homage to the imperial super weapon in the Star Wars franchise skews the color of Darth Vader’s cape with good use of Jägermeister digestif and Coca-Cola. He also makes a nifty little ice orb replica of the Death Star for extra empirical effect, but if you’re not the sort of person who has Star Wars molds in your freezer, regular cubes will do just fine. The Death Star (in this context, not that of the movies ) is essentially a twist on a Long Island Iced Tea , with three different liquors plus triple sec, sour mix and Coca-Cola. Of course, like with all modern cocktails, it’s better to create your own sour mix rather than rely on the pre-packaged kind. The best way to do so is to make a quick simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar, dissolved to combine), then add lemon and/or lime juice to taste. It should be a good balance of sweet and tart. For the base spirits, Jägermeister is the only one that can’t be substituted with a different brand, as its botanicals are unique. Swapping it for another amaro will lead to a different overall flavor profile. However, though Attart uses Gentleman Jack Tennessee whiskey, another Tennesse whiskey can stand in its place. Similarly, while he uses Grey Goose, you won’t throw the balance off in the Death Star if you use a different vodka brand. Whichever brands you use, the drink will be fully operational. As for the soda that gives it some of its Sith Lord coloring, that is one item that drinkers will never agree on. Some might say that anything similar to Coca-Cola will work, others will say it needs to be that brand and no other, and still others will say that another kind of cola would work even better. Keep in mind that this drink has a solid four ounces of liquor, though it might not taste it with the sour mix and cola. You’ll likely want to stick to one drink, or risk falling to the power of the Dark Side of the Force.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cucumber-rose-collins/,Cucumber & Rose Collins,Liquor.com,"The classic Tom Collins combines gin, lemon juice, sugar and club soda for a tall and refreshing drink that has quenched thirsts since at least the 19th century. The cocktail has remained a mainstay for a reason, as it’s difficult to improve on the simple formula. But that formula is also a template that talented bartenders can tweak to their tastes, creating unique versions of the Collins that deserve recognition. The Cucumber & Rose Collins comes from bartending vet Charlotte Voisey, who takes a trip through the garden to concoct this fresh twist. She begins with Hendrick’s gin, a modern-style gin that employs cucumbers and roses in its botanical makeup alongside stalwarts like juniper, coriander and citrus peels. She doubles down with cucumber juice and rose syrup before tying it all together with fresh lemon juice. The cucumber juice requires nothing more than a cucumber and a juicer. And you can easily make the three-ingredient rose syrup at home, too, as it’s essentially a rose-flavored simple syrup . Combine sugar, water and rose water in a pan, heat the mixture, then let it cool before use. The syrup will be sweet, floral, fragrant and ready to dose the Cucumber & Rose Collins or any other drink that might benefit from its unique charms.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-shifting-sands/,Shifting Sands,Kevin Gray,"Cocktails contain all manner of ingredients, from spirits and liqueurs to non-alcoholic mixers like club soda and tonic. But humble citrus fruits may be the unsung hero of the drinks world. Available in many varieties, from ubiquitous lemons, limes and oranges to less common yuzu and pomelo, citrus lends balance and refreshment to cocktails. Just look at the grapefruit. Its tart juice is employed in several classic drinks, including the Paloma , Hemingway Daiquiri and Greyhound , and it plays an important role in the Shifting Sands, an original cocktail from late bartender Sasha Petraske. Petraske was behind some of New York’s best bars, and he helped to usher in the modern cocktail revival with the opening of Milk & Honey in 1999. That’s where the Shifting Sands sprang to life. It combines gin with maraschino liqueur, grapefruit juice, lemon juice and club soda. The recipe calls specifically for Beefeater 24, a London dry gin that is made from a blend of 12 botanicals, including grapefruit peel and Japanese and Chinese green teas. Maraschino liqueur is up next. It’s a key component in cocktails like the Aviation and Hemingway Daiquiri that is distilled from Maraska cherries. It’s bittersweet, dry and often features a mild nuttiness alongside the cherry flavor. Fresh grapefruit juice is always a good complement to gin, especially in this case, as the gin contains grapefruit peel in its botanical makeup. The juice lends a healthy slug of citrus, dialing up the refreshment. A dash of lemon juice adds additional tartness and balance, before a topper of club soda imbues the drink with effervescence. The Shifting Sands is easy to make, which is part of its appeal. It contains ingredients that are readily available at local liquor stores, and it can be constructed by shaking with ice—no fancy tools or techniques required. This is a great option for fans of the Tom Collins who want to sip on something a bit more interesting than the tall, thirst-quenching classic.

But acclaimed bartender Naren Young says that, for him, nothing heralds the new season quite like rhubarb’s long, spindly stalks. These welcome sights foretell better weather, but they also give enterprising bartenders a fresh ingredient to use in drinks. Raw rhubarb is commonly cooked down with sugar and used in pies and other desserts. But that same method can be used to create a rhubarb syrup for drinks like Young’s Rhubarb & Strawberry Collins. In addition to the syrup, this recipe features gin or vodka (your choice), Aperol, fresh lemon juice, strawberry juice and a topper of club soda. Using gin will create a more flavorful drink punched up with gin’s dry and botanical character, while vodka is more neutral and will let the other flavors shine. Aperol is an Italian aperitivo best known for its use in the Aperol Spritz . Aperol has notes of orange, gentian and rhubarb and is like a tamer version of Campari. The DIY rhubarb syrup is essentially a rhubarb-laced simple syrup that you make by simmering sugar, water and chopped rhubarb in a pot on the stove. That, plus strawberry juice, sweeten the drink, while fresh lemon juice provides necessary acidity for balance. Finally, club soda lengthens and dilutes the strong flavors and gives each sip a refreshing, bubbly bite. Since you already scored some rhubarb for this recipe, you might as well use those stalks for the garnish, too. Young suggests soaking the stalks in a pickling liquid of raspberry vinegar, sugar, coriander and pink peppercorns. Apply these pickled stalks as a garnish, and you’ll have a crunchy snack between sips. 5 Rhubarb Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rhubarb syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'strawberry juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pickled rhubarb stalk', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin or vodka, Aperol, lemon juice, rhubarb syrup and strawberry juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with club soda.', 'Garnish with a lemon wheel and a pickled rhubarb stalk.']",7,gin

In fact, a Celery Sour recipe appeared in the 1917 edition of classic cocktail book “ The Ideal Bartender ” by Tom Bullock, though this recipe actually contained no spirit.

This bubbly highball was created by bartending vet Naren Young , best known for his time at award-winning New York bar Dante. Young says there are many different ways to add pears to a cocktail, and he’s yet to meet a spirit that the fruit doesn’t mix with. Once ripe, the fresh fruit can be muddled or blended into a puree. You can also experiment with bottled pear purees, as well as pear liqueurs and brandy. So you’ve got options for infusing your drinks with that trademark flavor.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/floradora/,Floradora,Liquor.com,"At first glance, the Floradora looks like a twist on a Tom Collins , with ginger beer replacing club soda and raspberry syrup replacing simple syrup. This may be the case, but the exact origins of this classic, pre-Prohibition drink are unclear. What is is clear, however, is that it was named for a popular Broadway musical that premiered in 1899. Florodora (spelled slightly different from its namesake drink) ran for over 550 performances and was famous for its dancing “Florodora girls.” Bright, pink and bubbly, the Floradora matched the aesthetics of the dancers from which it got its name. The spritzy gin drink balances the bitterness of London dry gin with the tartness of lime, sweetness and fruit of raspberry syrup and spicy-sweet flavors of ginger beer, resulting in a pleasing, refreshing highball. The drink is forgiving when it comes to its ingredients. Any London dry gin of decent quality will do, something like Beefeater, Tanqueray, Aria or Sipsmith. Ginger beer also offers an opportunity to play with spice and sweetness levels. A wide array of options are available these days, so it’s hard to go wrong. You can even try your hand at making your own . Or you could use ginger ale, if you prefer, but that will lead to a sweeter drink with less ginger spice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-bacchanalian/,Bacchanalian,Liquor.com,"Outside of Sangria and the New York Sour , red wine rarely makes its way into mixed drinks. Normally, when a bartender uses wine in a cocktail, they’ll pop open a bottle of Champagne or some other kind of bubbly. But the Bacchanalian is, at first glance, unconventional, and calls for merlot rather than a sparkling bottle. While it may seem odd, the drink is essentially a playful tweak on the New York Sour. Furthermore, it comes from bar legend Chris Hannah—the former bar manager of New Orleans’ famed Arnaud’s French 75 and founder of Jewel of the South —who made this cognac-and-merlot concoction for Mardi Gras celebrations. The Bacchanalian’s base is cognac, rather than a whiskey as is traditional in a sour. These fine French brandies are just as delicious in drinks as they are on their own, but you’ll want to opt for something in the more affordable range—luckily, even the relatively cheaper cognacs tend to still be of good quality, if not excellent. And, like a New York Sour, the drink takes a measure of red wine, though it gets mixed in rather than floated on top. Specifically, Hannah uses merlot—the bright juiciness of the low-tannin wine is perfect for mixing into a drink, adding gentle acidity and making it more robust. To build on those notes, Hannah also uses lemon juice and, rather than simple syrup, agave nectar. The sweetener gives the drink a richer, more lush feel without making it overly cloying. Finally, rather than using the traditional rocks glass or something like a coupe, Hannah shakes the Bacchanalian and pours it over fresh ice in a red wine glass. This gives it an additional touch of elegance, perfect for your next Mardi Gras get-together.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spiced-eggnog/,Spiced Eggnog,Samantha Hunter,"There are nearly as many Eggnog recipes as there are people to make them, which isn’t surprising considering the drink has been gracing glasses for a few hundred years. Ask your nearest bartender, friend or relative for their preferred version, and you’ll get an array of base ingredients (rum, bourbon, brandy) and techniques that range from hand-whisking eggs to throwing everything in a shaker with ice. This Spiced Eggnog recipe charts its own course, employing brandy, spiced rum and a blender. Portland, Oregon, bar legend Jeffrey Morgenthaler takes his seasonal Eggnog seriously. “Even the crappy stuff from the grocery store I love,” he says. There’s nothing crappy about his rich twist on the drink, made with fresh eggs, whole milk, heavy cream and a two flavorful liquors. The idea behind this recipe, he says, is to elevate the drink ""from something mundane to something more culinary."" Fortunately, you can achieve that culinary result without too much effort. Rather than separating the eggs, like many traditional Eggnog recipes call for, Morgenthaler beats whole eggs in a blender before adding the sugar and the liquid ingredients. This method saves time while still achieving the thick, rich consistency that you want.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/delete-that-text/,Delete That Text,Liquor.com,"The sour, composed of a spirit, citrus and sweetener, is a classic cocktail template that allows for endless modification. In this case, Patrick Cook, the beverage director at Hyperion Public in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, performs a neat trick to perfect his two-spirit blackberry sour. He enlists easygoing vodka to even out the drink, dubbed Delete That Text, because it seemed a little too gin-forward when he first made it. “I was in love with the drink, [but] it was almost too botanical and becoming unbalanced,” he says. “I knew that I still wanted to have two ounces of spirit but maybe dial it back just a touch.” Tweaking the ratio to equal-parts gin and vodka make the drink less intensely bold. “Vodka does a good job enhancing the boozy flavor you’re going for without disturbing the other flavors and allowing you to play around,” he says. He suggests experimenting with different amounts, as even a small half-ounce pour can do wonders to your drinks.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-ruby-patch/,Ruby Patch,H. Joseph Ehrmann,"During the early days of the so-called Cocktail Renaissance—when old recipes and lost spirits were being revived and bartenders were playing with all manner of ingredients—vodka had a bit of a slump. Not so much in sales, as it remained the top-selling spirit on the market and likely will remain so, but at least in the eyes of bartenders and many fans of cocktail culture. Its role as a neutral-grain spirit—that is a spirit without much in the way of assertive flavor—saw it labeled as something approaching useless in “serious” drinks. However, one area where vodka shined, and where it continues to shine, was in infusions. Even today, when vodkas are starting to be more celebrated for their nuance , the relatively neutral characteristic of vodka lends it to infusion, letting the flavors of the added ingredients, whether they be fruit or herbs or something else, come through clearly. In the Ruby Patch, from bartender and bar owner H. Joseph Ehrmann, Numi organic chai tea is infused in vodka, which is then flavored with strawberries and mint. In this bright and fruity summer libation, Ehrmann opts for Square One Organic Vodka. As a San Francisco bar-owner, Square One is a local spirit to him, made right there in the Bay Area. Given that it’s primarily a vessel for the tea, other vodkas can fill in, so feel free to use what you have on hand so long as it’s of decent quality and doesn’t come already flavored. The tea, on the other hand, is a little harder to substitute for. Ehrmann uses Numi Ruby Chai, a caffeine-free rooibos-based chai. The brightness of the South African red bush helps balance the rich spice from the chai blend, making for an overall brighter infusion. Like the Square One, Numi is local, as the company is based in Oakland. Still, other rooibos-based chais can stand in, if needed. To really punch up the brightness and fruitiness of this summery drink, it gets a handful of mint and strawberries muddled in it. As with all drinks that involve fresh fruit, it’s best to wait until the berries are in season before making this drink. But during other times of the year, you can use the same chai-infused vodka to make another of Ehrmann’s drinks: the Ruby Chai Appletini .","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'medium', 'ingredient': 'strawberries'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tea-infused Square One organic vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'strawberry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the strawberries and mint with the agave nectar.', 'Add the vodka and lemon juice and fill with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Collins glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a strawberry.']",0,vodka

It features bison grass vodka, pear brandy, hard apple cider, fresh lemon juice and honey syrup, bringing a lighter touch to traditional autumn flavors. Bison grass vodka, or Żubrówka, is a spirit that has been distilled in Poland since the 16th century. The name comes from the bison herds (known as Zubr) that graze the grass in Poland’s Bialowieza forest, and over the years it became a favorite drink of Polish royalty. The decidedly not-neutral vodka contains flavors of almond, vanilla, coconut and fresh cut grass, and is often consumed neat or mixed with club soda or apple juice. Young uses the punchy vodka as the foundation of the cocktail, complementing it with a measure of pear brandy. The two spirits lay down a solid base for the rich honey syrup and tart lemon juice, while the hard apple cider lends additional flavor and proof, lengthening and rounding the drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/elixir-bloody-mary/,Bloody Elixir,Liquor.com,"The Bloody Mary is perhaps the most iconic breakfast drink, an enlivening mixture of tomato juice, vodka and spices. Its strength stems from its versatility, and every bartender has their own take on the recipe , one they claim is the best interpretation. Often, this means incorporating hot sauces, spices, vinegars and other modifiers. The Bloody Elixir is one such variation. The recipe comes from H. Joseph Ehrmann. He is a lauded San Francisco bartender and owner of Elixir Saloon (from where the drink gets its name), one of the Bay Area’s oldest taverns. His take on the drink doesn’t get too wild: Most elements of it would be familiar to anyone who has messed around with Bloody Mary concoctions. However, he has a few of his own additions, including dried dill and a house-made “Elixir Juice,” a mixture of pickle and olive brines. Though the recipe isn’t explicitly outlined, you can make the Juice by mixing olive brine, dill pickle brine and then whatever other pickle brines you most enjoy. It’s flexible, so don’t stress about the proportions. Ehrmann is a big lover of Square One, an organic distillery located in the Bay Area. Many of his drinks, including the Bloody Elixir, use the distillery’s vodka, but feel free to swap it for whatever vodka you have on hand. Ehrmann suggests a rye vodka, as that style better stands up to the other ingredients. Or you can try another spirit, if you prefer the extra aromatics of aquavit or the earthy spice of tequila. When it comes to any Bloody Mary variant, the garnish is critical. Some recipes call for an abundance of vegetables or even ingredients like bacon, fried chicken or shrimp skewers. Ehrmann’s version is relatively modest, calling for only bacon and a pickle. You can always omit the pork (or swap it for a vegan product) if you’d prefer. And, rather than salt or a flavored-salt rim, Ehrmann lines his glass with Old Bay seasoning. This classic East Coast seafood spice is a lovely enhancement for the drink, so Ehrmann encourages bartenders to serve the cocktail without a straw, so that each sip carries with it some of the Old Bay. 12 Bloody Mary Twists to Try Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Old Bay seasoning'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Square One organic vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'dried dill weed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'ground white pepper'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'celery salt'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Worcestershire sauce'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Tabasco sauce'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Elixir Juice (a mixture of olive brine, dill pickle brine and various other pickle brines)'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'prepared horseradish'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tomato juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: kosher dill pickle', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: cooked thick-cut bacon slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Coat the rim of a pint glass with Old Bay Seasoning.', 'Add the vodka, dill, white pepper, celery salt, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce, Elixir Juice, lemon juice, horseradish and tomato juice into a shaker with ice.

But while this practice may be a current trend, its roots date back decades or more. Just look to the Bloody Bull, an extra-savory Bloody Mary variation whose recipe calls for beef broth. The Bloody Bull starts out much like a typical Bloody Mary . It features vodka as its base and tomato juice as an important mixer. Traditional accompaniments like lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce complement the vodka and tomato juice and tie the room together. But a generous pour of beef broth takes the flavor in a new and meaty direction, perfect for those times when your morning can benefit from a beefier cocktail. You can experiment with your proportions, dialing the broth up or down until you find your preferred recipe. But a good starting point is to dole out the vodka, broth and tomato juice in equal parts. The Bloody Bull’s origin story isn’t entirely clear, but many reports peg its creation to Brennan’s in New Orleans. It makes sense.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/celery-cup-no-1/,Celery Cup No. 1,Liquor.com,"The bright and sweet Pimm’s Cup is a consummate summertime libation, the sort of thing best enjoyed in a garden or on a plant-lined patio. This playful variation from bartender H. Joseph Ehrmann, owner of Elixir Saloon in San Fransisco, doubles down on the vegetal quality of the drink with the addition of celery, cilantro and cucumber, muddling them into the drink rather than leaving them as a garnish. The Celery Cup No. 1 relies on the quality and freshness of the produce used. Ehrmann advises using a celery piece closest to the heart, where it’s sweetest. Using one of the larger, thicker outer stems can lead to a bitter, spicier drink. He also includes cilantro, which can taste soapy to some palates; there’s no real substitution for it, so if you’re making this for someone who doesn’t care for cilantro it’s best to omit it. Along with an English cucumber—which is thinner and sweeter than the more traditional slicer cucumbers found at grocery stores—Ehrmann uses cucumber vodka from Square One , a distillery in the Bay Area. Though the organic vodka is a solid option—and nearby to Ehrmann's historic bar—there are substitutions available. Prairie Organic , from Minnesota, makes a cucumber vodka and has the benefit of also being organic. Effen Vodka , from Holland, produces a fine cucumber vodka, and Plume and Petal’s cucumber-flavored vodka is only 40-proof, or 20% alcohol, for those who want a lower-proof Celery Cup. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Pimm’s Cup variation without the namesake liqueur. However, with only 1/2 ounce of it in the drink, the Pimm’s No. 1 plays more of a support role in the Celery Cup No. 1, leading to a brighter, lighter drink. Most of the sweetness comes from the agave nectar, so those who like their cocktails dry and crisp can cut back on that. Regardless, the drink will be a lovely summer sipper, refreshing and eminently quaffable.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': '(2-inch) piece', 'ingredient': 'celery'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'handful', 'ingredient': 'cilantro'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '(1-inch) piece', 'ingredient': 'English cucumber'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Square One cucumber vodka'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': ""Pimm's No. 1""}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'celery stalk', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a shaker, muddle the cucumber, celery, cilantro and lemon juice to a pulp.', 'Add the vodka, agave nectar and Pimm’s, fill with ice, and shake until well-chilled', 'Double-strain into a tall glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a leafy celery stalk from the heart.']",0,vodka

You can easily make it yourself by using a juicer to turn the ingredients into a bright green elixir that tastes good on its own but is also perfect for cocktails. “We wanted to offer a lighter cocktail option where you can get your nutrients and a buzz in one glass,” says Elizabeth Blau, the founder and CEO of restaurant planning and development company Blau + Associates , which operates Honey Salt. That is easily accomplished with the drink’s mix of vodka, green juice, lemon juice and agave nectar . The vodka allows the fresh produce to shine through without overpowering the flavors, while the lemon juice brings additional tartness and the agave nectar balances the equation with a hint of sweetness.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lychee/,Lychee,Liquor.com,"San Francisco bartender Kevin Diedrich created the Lychee cocktail while working at the now-closed BDK. Inspired by salted pistachio ice cream, he combined tea-infused vodka with coconut-lychee milk, salted pistachio syrup and fresh lime juice for a fun and tropical result. Absolut Wild Tea vodka is the cocktail’s base. It merges Chinese oolong tea with Swedish elderflower for a smooth and floral taste with hints of red apples, black tea, elderflower and citrus. Diedrich makes the coconut-lychee milk and salted pistachio syrup himself. The former blends light coconut milk with whole lychees, lime juice and zest, salt, vanilla extract, Jamaican rum and fresh grated ginger. The latter is similar to pistachio orgeat and sees roasted nuts cooked on the stove with sugar and water to create a nutty syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/robin-redbreast/,Robin Redbreast,Liquor.com,"Fresh juice in cocktails is a revelation, but the spectrum extends well beyond lemons and limes. And while orange is the juice of choice for Mimosas and Screwdrivers , the hardworking fruit can be employed in countless other drinks. You can also switch up your citrus and feature its cousin, the blood orange, which lends cocktails a festive shade of red. Blood oranges are the most common variety of orange grown in Italy (predominantly in Sicily) and are also very common throughout southern Spain and the U.S., notably in Texas and California. Depending on where they come from, blood orange season can last from November or December until the early spring. Bartender and writer Naren Young says that blood oranges are among bartenders’ most sought-after and anticipated ingredients each season, perhaps because their availability is so fleeting. “Blood oranges have a slightly different flavor than the oranges we are most accustomed to,” says bartender Kevin Denton, who created the Robin Redbreast. It features vodka, blood orange juice, triple sec and lime juice and is a tart, refreshing option during blood orange season and for holiday gatherings. “The main thing to remember is that orange juice, particularly anything not freshly squeezed, is much more mellow in cocktails that we think it’s going to be,” adds Denton. You, of course, will be using the fresh stuff for the best flavor. 12 Blood Orange Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'triple sec'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blood orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible orchid', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, triple sec, blood orange juice and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a coupe glass.', 'Garnish with an edible orchid and an orange twist.']",8,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/stunner/,Stunner,Liquor.com,"Beer as a cocktail ingredient has been catching on in recent years. The sheer variety of styles, from hoppy IPAs to dark and malty porters and stouts, lends itself to creative concoctions and new drink ideas. In the Stunner, from Chicago bartender Sam Ruppert, Irish whiskey meets a fruity and tropical IPA for a fresh and effervescent drink. With only a half ounce of whiskey and a small amount of IPA, the Stunner is a light and refreshing sipper, something you can enjoy a few glasses of before you start to get overly buzzed. Ruppert uses Glendalough double-barrel Irish whiskey in the cocktail, but the category of Irish whiskeys is plentiful, with many options to choose from. The beer, too, is flexible. Ruppert uses Hipster Meets Shark, a wheat IPA from Chicago’s DryHop Brewers , where he worked when he developed the Stunner. When selecting an IPA for your recipe, be sure to use something fruit-forward, bright and dry. An overly malty or overly bitter IPA can throw the recipe off. For sweetness and color, the drink gets Heering cherry liqueur and demerara sugar syrup, the latter of which is richer and darker than normal simple syrup. Lemon juice amplifies the fruit and crispness of the beer, and Bittermens Burlesque bitters—which are made with hibiscus, acai berry and peppers—bring depth and nuance. Finally, the drink gets a touch of smoke with a mist of Laphroaig single-malt over the top. However, if you don’t have Laphroaig on hand, another Islay single malt can work. 11 Beer Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'IPA'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cherry liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demerara syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'scotch'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Lemon wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add Irish whiskey, IPA, Heering cherry liqueur, demerara syrup, lemon juice and Bittermens Burlesque bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a highball glass over ice.', 'Spray the scotch as a mist over top.', 'Garnish with a skewered lemon wedge and cherry.']",0,whiskey

In addition to vodka, it calls for pineapple juice and melon liqueur ( Midori is a popular choice, and the most ubiquitous example). The Pearl Harbor is similar to the Midori Sour , which features vodka, Midori and either sour mix or fresh citrus. But in this case, the drink skips the citrus and finds additional fruit flavor and balance from pineapple juice. Fortunately, there are several bottled pineapple juices that work nicely in drinks. If you have an electric juicer, or want to juice the fruit by hand, you’ll create an even tastier drink with more pronounced pineapple notes. But don’t hesitate to use the bottled stuff. Once you shake your ingredients with ice, you’re left with a cocktail that is cooling, refreshing and a perfect choice for warm weather. It also looks great in the glass. Midori gives it a bright green hue that can turn heads from across the room. Everyone will want to know what you’re drinking.

The punchy rhizome gives drinks a fresh, spicy bite, and it pairs with everything from vodka and rum to smoky scotch. The Ginger Smash epitomizes the ingredient’s friendly nature. The cocktail features a delicious mix of rum, two liqueurs, fresh pineapple, lime juice and, of course, ginger. The recipe was created by Jason Kosmas and Dushan Zaric of Employees Only, the famous New York cocktail bar that has since expanded to Los Angeles, Miami and Singapore. They start the drink with light rum, adding Luxardo maraschino liqueur for its bittersweet cherry notes and Berentzen apple liqueur for its juicy fruit flavor. The pineapple and ginger are crushed with a muddler to extract their juices and oils, and fresh lime juice and sugar provide balance to the diverse medley of flavors. Muddling the pineapple and ginger is what makes this Ginger Smash a smash. This loose category of cocktails involves fruit, spirit and ice, but from there the details are open for interpretation.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rum-dum/,Rum Dum,Liquor.com,"This take on a rum sour was created more than 40 years ago by one Wilfred Sands . At the time he was the bartender at the exclusive Lyford Cay Club in New Providence, Bahamas. Reportedly, he adapted the recipe for a guest that wanted a rum drink that was “not too sweet.” Today, he still serves the drink, now as the Head Mixologist at the Red Turtle Tavern at John Watling’s Distillery in Nassau, Bahamas. According to the John Watling’s Distillery website, he is affectionately and respectfully known as Uncle Will there. The closest relative to the Rum Dum is the iconic Daiquiri . However, the Rum Dum substitutes lemon juice for lime and plain sugar for simple syrup. It also adds an egg white for extra foaminess and a silky mouthfeel. While using a blend of rums in drinks is a common practice, here you’ll want to refrain, instead floating the darker amber rum on top, which adds layers, figuratively and literally, to the drink. As with any sort of rum drink, there is always an opportunity to play with whatever rum you have on hand. After all, John Watling’s rum was not available when Sands first invented the Rum Dum in 1971. What is advisable, however, is to use a light rum for the base of the drink and a darker pot still rum for the float. Pot still rums often have what is referred to as a “funk,” an aromatic richness and earthiness that many rum fans adore. Using such a distinct rum for the float means that the Rum Dum transforms as you drink it. It starts with the bold wildness of the pot still, then goes into the more gentle, sweet and sour elements of the drink itself. Eventually what remains of the float will naturally incorporate into the drink, further transforming it as the flavors meld. The float also provides a visual treat with the layer of rum separate from the rest. Layering the rum can be a bit tricky. One tip is to place a spoon upside down against the top of the drink, and slowly pour the rum down the backside of the spoon so the added rum doesn’t break the cocktail’s surface.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/shandy-khan/,Shandy Khan,Liquor.com,"When it comes to celebrating your home football team, you can dress up in the requisite uniform, paint your face and yell at your television set all game. Or, you can make up a signature cocktail in honor of the team, like Jacksonville, Florida, bartender Josh Strickland did for the Jaguars. The Shandy Khan is named for Jaguars owner Shahid Khan, and sees blue curaçao carefully layered to give the Shandy-style cocktail the appearance of a Jaguars jersey. “This is perfect for those über-hot Florida tailgates early in the year. It’s bright and refreshing without being so boozy that you’re in trouble before the fourth quarter starts,” says Strickland. As it’s an homage to the city and its football team, Strickland included a number of local ingredients when he made the Shandy Khan at Restaurant Orsay , which may cause difficulties for those making the drink outside of Jacksonsville. Strickland starts with rum from Marlin & Barrel distillery in nearby Fernandina Beach. This amber rum isn’t all that accessible outside of the area, so feel free to substitute another good-quality amber rum. Similarly, he uses the Jon Boat Coastal Ale from Local Institution Ale Works , a brewery located right next to Everbank Field, the home of the Jags. This English style ale is cool fermented, giving it a lager-like character. If you can’t get your hands on a bottle but still want to make the Shandy Khan in honor of the Jacksonville team, you’ll have to swap the ale out for another light, crisp ale or even a lager. The other ingredients are easier to come by—lemon juice, honey syrup, orange bitters and a float of blue curaçao, giving it its signature teal and gold coloring. You can use a store-bought blue curaçao well enough, or try your hand at making your own for something more compelling. Strickland advises those looking to catch an in-person game to batch everything but the curaçao ahead of time. “If you are a savvy tailgater, you will cook up a batch beforehand and simply top them off with beer and ‘blue stuff’ as you go,” he says.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pink-frozen-margarita/,Pink Frozen Margarita,Liquor.com,"The Margarita may be the quintessential summer drink. An intoxicating mixture of sweet, sour and earthy, it’s beloved by everyone from college students hosting parties to serious cocktail snobs working on their craft. Its history is clouded , and its origins are hotly debated. However, the most compelling argument points to American expatriates traveling to Mexico and making Mexican versions of the Daisy cocktail, a rum sour, as ”daisy“ translates to ”margarita“ in Spanish. By whatever journey, the drink came to be, the Margarita is clearly here to stay. Traditionally, the Margarita is a shaken drink, served up or over ice. Like the Daiquiri , though, it’s a drink that is often blended; for some, the Frozen Margarita is the natural, most familiar form of the drink. Tossing the components in a blender does more than make it slushy, too. Doing so provides an easy opportunity for making large batches, as well as effortlessly incorporating ingredients like fruit. Often, if a blended Margarita carries a pink hue like the Pink Frozen Margarita does, it means there’s some kind of red fruit in it (or a facsimile of one), most likely raspberries and/or strawberries. In this version from blogger and recipe developer Matt Armato , the blended Margarita gets its pink flush from Campari , the ruby-hued aperitif from Italy. Though traditionally paired with gin in drinks like the Negroni , this bittersweet liqueur marries beautifully with tequila. In the Pink Frozen Margarita it adds additional levels of complexity and depth and helps balance the sweetness of the drink. Those concerned that Campari’s intense aromatics and bracing bitterness would overwhelm the drink can be assured that the liqueur takes a backseat. With only three ounces of the crimson-hued spirit in a batch of six drinks, it serves more as an embellishment or modifier, especially with the amount of other ingredients including blended ice. While blended drinks are, for good reason, associated with beach trips and spring break parties, there’s nothing keeping you from enjoying the Pink Frozen Margarita year-round. In fact, it’s a good way to bring a bit of summer to the cold seasons.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-bulldog-smash/,Bulldog Smash,Liquor.com,"The Whiskey Smash is a classic cocktail that dates back to at least 1887 (and probably much earlier), when it first appeared in print in the “Bar-Tender’s Guide” by Jerry Thomas. It’s a refreshing drink that merges whiskey with sugar, citrus and mint. It gets its name because the citrus and mint are “smashed“ or, to be precise, muddled. Of course, the Whiskey Smash is a riff on the Mint Julep , that traditional combination of bourbon, sugar and mint. But this here is the Bulldog Smash, a seasonal, peachy spin on both classic cocktails. To make it, you’re going to need all of the ingredients below, plus a muddler, a handy tool used to extract juice and oils from ingredients like fruit, herbs and citrus peels. After muddling the lemon wedges and peaches with your sugar and mint, you’re left with a mash of sweet, tart, minty fruit that adds flavor and body. From there, you’ll add the bourbon, which provides the drink’s boozy backbone, as well as the Cointreau, a French orange liqueur that amplifies those rich fruit notes. The Bulldog Smash tastes great all year-round, but the fusion of bourbon, peach, lemon, mint and crushed ice is especially effective during the hot summer months.

The Sweet Tea Smash was created at Please Don’t Tell (aka PDT) in New York City, the famed speakeasy-style bar with a phone booth entrance. While PDT is known for its creative concoctions, the Sweet Tea Smash is quite simple. The summery cocktail merges Tennessee whiskey , with iced tea, Strega (an Italian liqueur made from 70 herbs and spices), sugar, lemon and mint. The latter two ingredients are muddled in a shaker, or smashed, hence the drink’s name. A good smash requires a good muddler. You want to compress the lemon wedges to release their juices and also the rich oils in the peel. But be careful to press the mint rather than shred it. Destroying mint leaves releases a bitterness you don’t want in your cocktail. Fix this refreshing drink when the sun is high and the weather is warm.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bowery-orchard/,Bowery Orchard,Liquor.com,"Looking for a perfect cool weather drink, something to beckon in the red and gold of fall? The Bowery Orchard might be the ticket. This autumn libation from bartending veteran Willy Shine is essentially a variation on a Whiskey Sour , but the additions of a few fun ingredients transform it into something altogether new. With fresh squeezed apple juice and a touch of elderflower cordial, it might be your new favorite way to welcome September and October, an orchard you’ll want to visit over and over. The base of the cocktail is Tennessee Whiskey —Shine originally used Gentleman Jack, a high-end label from Jack Daniels, but one that’s reasonably priced for use in cocktails. To properly construct this drink, don’t substitute another kind of bourbon—the charcoal filtering in Tennessee whiskey is what gives it, and the Bowery Orchard, its signature smooth, gently sweet characteristic. To build on the natural smoothness of Tennessee whiskey, Shine adds the usual simple syrup, but also a quarter-ounce of elderflower cordial. This is not the same as elderflower liqueur, like the ubiquitous St-Germain, but rather a non-alcoholic elderflower-flavored syrup. You can, however, use an elderflower liqueur in its place—considering the small volume and low-alcohol, it won’t raise the proof of the final product by much at all. Lemon juice helps balance the sweetness of the drink by bringing much-needed acidity, while an ounce of apple juice makes it extra juicy and autumnal. As with all juices, the fresher the apple juice is, the better. Try to skip anything made with concentrate—if possible, grab a fresh squeezed apple juice from your local grocer or farmers market.

Summertime saw patios across the U.S.—and beyond—filled with drinkers enjoying frozen rosé. Sometimes it was straight-forward: Just frozen and blended rosé, maybe with a bit of sweetener. Other recipes involved vodka or other hard alcohol giving an extra kick. And while a very basic frosé recipe can be refreshing and satisfying, it can be fun to get more creative. “Frosé has been done over and over, so the true inspiration was finding a way to incorporate new flavors and offer our guests a new experience,” says Gary Wallach, the director of food and beverage at A.R.T. SoHo at the Arlo SoHo hotel in New York City. To that end, Wallach created the Triple Berry Chamomile Frosé, a mix of rosé, vodka, shrub, chamomile tea and a pre-batched frosé mix from Kelvin Slush Co. “The berries pull out all the fruit notes in the rosé, making it a well-rounded cocktail,” Wallach adds.

Vodka gives the drink some backbone and booziness, while the Kelvin mix adds fruitiness and balanced sweetness. Made with organic peach and strawberry juice, the mix contains no artificial colors or corn syrup.

She originally made the cocktail with Aylesbury Duck vodka, but if you can’t find that, don’t fret—you can easily sub in your favorite vodka for equally good results. Beyond just combining ingredients, Nossa muddles a blackberry with the vodka, lemon and sugar, infusing the fruit’s sweet and tart flavor into the liquid ingredients. The basil is added directly into the shaker, lending its green herbaceous notes to the cocktail. Finally, the cooler features a healthy pour of rosé, which is always a fine idea when crafting summer drinks . “This is a light and refreshing cooler that has enough oomph with the vodka but is still sessionable,” says Nossa. “The wine I use is from our family friend Richard Betts, but this cocktail would be awesome with most rosés.” That wine is the French rosé from My Essential Wine, if you’re able to source a bottle. Try it out with various types of rosé and see what you like, and while you do, enjoy the nuances of the blackberry and basil, which help to brighten this warm-weather drink.

The drink leans toward a fall Sangria , with its red wine and fruity flavors, but the full measure of vodka keeps the beverage squarely in the spirit-based cocktail category. For the vodka, Oertel suggests Elit by Stolichnaya, an ultra-premium option that’s made from grain and features a mildly sweet profile. But you can choose whichever bottle you prefer and achieve similar results. When picking out your wine, there’s no need to pull out your best bottle, as a complex bottle may be lost within the other ingredients. So, save that wine for a special occasion, and instead use a budget-friendly wine that is light, dry and easygoing—but obviously one you still enjoy drinking.

A simple mix of vodka and cranberry juice, poured tall in a glass and garnished with a lime wedge, it’s one of the easier-to-make cocktails you’ll come across. You don’t even have to shake it, strain it or employ any bar tools to make the Cape Codder.

Yes, the Vodka Soda and Gin & Tonic also fit the criteria, but the alliterative nature of the 7 & 7 rolls off the tongue. The ingredients are right there in the name, and you only have to remember one word which, in this case, happens to be a number. This classic highball combines Seagram’s 7 Crown whiskey with 7UP. Seagram’s 7 originally hails from Canada, but after changing hands in an acquisition it now calls the United States home. The blended whiskey has a sweet taste and creamy vanilla finish, and while it can be consumed any way you like, it is most commonly mixed into simple highballs. In the 7 & 7, it merges seamlessly with 7UP’s sweet lemon-lime effervescence. The 7 & 7 rose to its height of popularity in the 1970s, when Seagram’s 7 sold tens of millions of cases each year and the distinctive bottle adorned every back bar and at-home bar cart. It’s not as popular today as it once was, but it’s easy to feel an affectionate sense of nostalgia for this classic drink. Much of the appeal lies in how easy the cocktail is to make. With only two ingredients, this isn’t a complicated serve. There are no fancy garnishes, esoteric liqueurs or even the need for citrus fruit or bar tools. You pour whiskey and 7UP into a tall glass with ice, and then you drink it. That’s all there is to it. You can also pair Seagram’s 7 with other mixers like club soda or ginger ale, of course. You can even sneak some Sprite in there, and no one save for the most discerning lemon-lime soda fans will know the difference. But you will know.

Because regardless of your affiliation, cocktails are something we can all cheer for together. On the Wings of Eagles was created by Philadelphia bartender Matthew Polzin during his time at The Olde Bar and is inspired by the Philadelphia Eagles. The drink features a boozy combination of Fernet-Branca, cognac, rye whiskey, green Chartreuse and lemon bitters, plus a mint sprig for garnish. The Fernet-Branca bottle’s famous logo features an eagle and globe, so this bitter amaro made from a secret blend of 27 herbs, roots and spices was a natural choice. And the green Chartreuse , made from a secret recipe of 130 herbs, matches the Eagles’ green uniforms. To make the cocktail, Polzin rinses a glass with the fernet. He then stirs the cognac, rye, green Chartreuse and bitters in a mixing glass before straining the contents into the fernet-rinsed serving glass. This trick ensures that the powerful fernet accents rather than overwhelms the other ingredients. Whether you’re an Eagles fan or not, everyone can enjoy the On the Wings of Eagles cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kitchen-sink/,Kitchen Sink,Liquor.com,"There’s plenty to think about when you’re hosting a party, from curating the perfect guest list (and playlist) to ensuring that you have enough food and drinks for your attendees. Of course, you want ample time for mingling with your guests, a goal that can be derailed if you’re playing bartender all night. That’s where batched cocktails come in; rather than getting stuck behind a bar stirring cocktail after individual cocktail, you can make a batch ahead of time and let guests serve themselves. One such large-format drink comes from bartender Sean Hoard, the co-owner of The Commissary in Portland, Oregon, a wholesale shop for high-quality bar mixes and juices. Perfect for a game day libation, the Kitchen Sink combines apple brandy , tequila and lager for a bright, crisp punch. However, its appeal is also due to its flexibility, as you can include whichever ingredients you prefer. “The Kitchen Sink is a template,” says Hoard. “Feel free to substitute ingredients based on what you have lying around the house. If tequila isn’t your thing, try rye in its place. If you don’t have honey, make a two-to-one with maple syrup. Can’t have beer? Cider would taste great. If it sounds like it’ll taste good, chances are it will.” Everything You Need to Know About Apple Brandy and Applejack RELATED ARTICLE If you do stick with the given recipe, you’ve still got options—there are numerous apple brandies out there, from West Coast distilleries like St. George Spirits and Clear Creek Distillery to Calvados from Normandy, France. It’s also up to you what tequila to use; since the drink includes brandy, beer, honey and lemon, it’s pretty forgiving when it comes to the tequila so long as you don’t use something too close to the bottom of the shelf. The other benefit to the Kitchen Sink is that once you’ve batched it and served it in a punch bowl, your party guests can serve themselves and choose how much beer (or cider) they want to top their glass with. Some might go for something boozier, while others can enjoy something more like a strong Shandy .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bananarac/,Bananarac,Liquor.com,"When it comes to staples of the cocktail world, it’s hard to be more iconic than the Sazerac . This classic New Orleans drink is at least 150 years old, and possibly closer to 200, though, as with many drinks, the history can get fuzzy. While first made with French brandy, it switched over to calling for rye whiskey after phylloxera devastated French wine crops in the late 19th century. A Sazerac is recognizable by those with bar knowhow, as it’s served up, but in a chilled Old Fashioned or rocks glass with no garnish or ice rather than traditional stemware. That’s not the case with the Bananarac. This Sazerac variation comes from Natasha David, a star bartender and founder of New York City’s now-closed Nitecap as well as You and Me Cocktails , a bar consulting company. Beyond adding ice, David adds a rather unexpected ingredient: banana, in the form of Giffard Banane du Brésil liqueur. Rather than decide between rye whiskey and brandy for the base, David opts for a blend of both, a technique that should be familiar to fans of the Sazerac. In particular, she uses Old Overholt—a popular and affordable quality rye whiskey—and Tariquet VSOP Armagnac. The brandy here is on the pricey side, around $70 in most markets. Like with any drink, it is possible to substitute a little less expensive bottle for a more affordable final drink. The banana element, on the other hand, has no easy substitutions. Giffard Banane du Brésil liqueur is a singular product, and while there are other banana liqueurs, few of them are of the same quality as the rich, fruity liqueur made with macerated bananas and spiked with cognac. There’s only a half-ounce in the drink, but it comes through with gentle assertiveness. It adds a unique element without overwhelming the flavor profile with strident banana-notes. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Sazerac without bitters, but David holds off on the Peychaud’s Bitters that give the traditional Sazerac its signature ruby hue. Instead, she uses a single dash of The Bitter Truth Old Time aromatic bitters.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spanish-gin-and-tonic/,Spanish Gin & Tonic,Nonna Titulauri,"If you order a Gin & Tonic at a bar, your drink will most likely come garnished with a lime or lemon wedge. There’s nothing wrong with that classic option, as it can be squeezed into the cocktail for a citrusy kick or dropped in for a more subtle effect per the drinker’s preference. However, the G&T’s accompaniment doesn’t have to stop at basic citrus fruits. All throughout Spain, and particularly in Basque Country, it’s common to see Gin & Tonics garnished with all manner of ingredients and combinations. The key is considering every component of the drink to ensure they work in harmony. London dry gins are very juniper-forward, and they vary significantly from modern-style gins, especially those featuring more citrusy and floral flavor profiles. When choosing your garnish, you can elect to highlight the flavors already in the gin, or add flavors that are absent from the gin. The same rule applies to the tonic water. Not every tonic is the same, as the quinine-and-botanical-laced beverage varies in sweetness, bitterness and herbal notes. So, your garnish should also work in concert with your tonic. This recipe features juniper berries, a lemon wheel and thyme, but you can experiment with seasonal fruits and herbs to find the best combination for your own tastes. Other good garnish options include lime wheels, rosemary, lavender, a vanilla bean pod, sliced peaches, berries and even saffron—all ingredients that you’re likely to see when drinking in Spain. The Spanish G&T can be served in a rocks glass or highball glass, but it’s traditionally served in a copa de balon, also known as a balloon glass. The wide-mouthed wine glass not only looks good—it allows you to pack in more garnishes, and it highlights the drink’s aromatics with each sip. Remember to use a good bottle of freshly opened tonic whenever possible. A soda gun can work in a pinch, especially if you’re at a bar and that’s the only game in town. But it’s more likely that the tonic will be overly sweet or lacking carbonation when it comes from a gun. Good bottled tonics like Fever-Tree, Q Tonic and East Imperial source quality ingredients and offer a variety of options featuring different flavor profiles, which helps to ensure that your Spanish Gin & Tonic journey is a successful one.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/amaretto-french-75/,Amaretto French 75,Liquor.com,"Amaretto is a contentious spirit. For many, it conjures regrettable memories of sickly syrupy drinks at college bars and clubs, and the inevitable sugar crash-heightened hangovers of the following day. Admittedly, when mixed with the “sour mix” often used in the Amaretto Sour, it can be an unpleasant drink. But as an ingredient, there is plenty of purpose for the almond-flavored liqueur, as a number of bartenders around the country have determined (including Jeffery Morgenthaler of Portland, Oregon, whose Amaretto Sour recipe is a revelation). One such bartender is Ryan Ward, who worked as the beverage director at Momofuku CCDC in Washington, D.C. “Amaretto isn’t just almond; it has notes of vanilla, citrus and some baking spice,” he says. In his variation on the classic French 75 , he swaps the simple syrup for Amaretto, whose marzipan qualities imbue the drink with a “lush toasty note,” according to him. Ward also says that the marzipan profile of the spirit lends itself well to mixing with citrus and spice flavors. This leads to the use of Nikka Coffey gin in his take on the French 75, which has lots of citrus and green pepper botanicals from sansho peppers, a relative of the Szechuan peppercorn. The Japanese gin’s name is a reference to the column still used in distillation and named for its creator, the Irish distiller Aeneas Coffey. The French 75 is a rare drink in that its base spirit may have changed over the years. While some early recipes do include gin, others suggest that it was cognac that was originally used. However, using that or another brandy along with Ward’s inclusion of Amaretto may make the drink too sweet, especially without the bite of pepperiness and the citrus tang that Nikka Coffey Gin has. For the brut sparkling wine portion of the drink, Champagne is, of course, never a bad call. However if that is out of reach, there are plenty of other sparkling wines on the market that would make a good French 75; just be sure to go as dry as possible or risk an overly sweet drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/french-harvest/,French Harvest,Liquor.com,"Gin is not bound by constraints like season or weather, but given its refreshing character, it is often reserved for warm-weather sipping. As a result, many gin drinks like the French 75 receive the same treatment, shelved during fall and winter as people make room for hot cocktails and hearty whiskey favorites like the Manhattan . There is a simple solution to this quandary: Expand your horizons and recognize gin’s year-round potential. However, if you want to nudge a refined classic like the French 75 into an autumnal direction, that can be arranged. The French Harvest was created by Denver-based writer Linnea Covington. It’s a fall-appropriate take on the French 75 (gin, lemon, sugar, Champagne) that features Nolet’s silver dry gin, simple syrup and lemon juice, but skips the Champagne. Instead, it finds bubbles by way of sparkling cider, giving the cocktail a welcome apple kick that you can appreciate during the holidays and colder months. Nolet’s gin is floral and fruit-forward, with peach, raspberry and rose included among its botanicals. Its fruity profile works well with the slightly funky Le Brun organic cidre from France. If you can’t find this brand, you can swap it for any dry sparkling cider you like. The combination of gin and cider balanced with simple syrup and fresh citrus is almost enough to have you forget the traditional Champagne version.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/elderflower-fizz/,Elderflower Fizz,Alex Frane,"Elderflower liqueur and sparkling wine have long been a celebrated combination. The sweetness and floral aspect of the liqueur are beautifully highlighted by a dry, bubbly wine like cava or Champagne. The simplest take on this is the St-Germain Cocktail , a spritz made with the eponymous elderflower liqueur, club soda and white wine, and the Elderflower Fizz builds on that basic formula. The drink comes from bartender Trudy Thomas, who created it while at the Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona. In the drink, St-Germain elderflower liqueur is joined by vodka, agave nectar and lime and is topped with sparkling wine. St-Germain largely started the elderflower liqueur craze in the early part of the “Cocktail Renaissance” when it was introduced in 2007. It was jokingly referred to as “the bartender’s ketchup,” as the elegant bottles were found at cocktail bars across the country. Today, it’s not quite so ubiquitous, but still regularly found on cocktail menus. Furthermore, St-Germain has been joined by a number of other elderflower spirits, including the French Drillaud Elderflower Liqueur and the U.S. crafted St. Elder Elderflower Liqueur . While the Elderflower Fizz specifically calls for the original, you can substitute others to your tastes and preference. The Elderflower Fizz calls for using Gruet sparkling wine as its bubbly. The New Mexico winery is well known for its affordable, Champagne-style wines. The Brut is a solid choice for this cocktail, as the dry, sparkling wine is an excellent value for using in cocktails. For even more depth, though, the Blanc de Blanc offers an elegant and robust flavor profile for only a little more expense. Gruet rosé, while lovely, should be avoided to maintain the clarity of the drink’s color. For her spritz, Thomas uses Square One Organic vodka, a bottling from an organic, woman-owned and operated distillery in Virginia.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lemon-shandy/,Lemon Shandy,Liquor.com,"Beer is great on its own, but it doesn’t have to be a solo act. It adds body, bubbles and a frothy kick to cocktails, even when the cocktail only contains two ingredients, and neither are liquor. Enter the Shandy. The light, refreshing and relatively low-alcohol Shandy was popularized in Europe during the early 20th century. Typically composed of light beer and lemonade, the Shandy is a thirst-quenching option on hot days, particularly if lawnmowers or sunny patios are involved. The Lemon Shandy is a classic combination of lager and lemonade, poured in equal parts and served in a pint glass. With just two ingredients and no special tools or techniques required, it can be constructed by anyone, regardless of bartending pedigree or home bar setup. The result is light, fizzy and quaffable—all the traits you want in a warm-weather drink. If you like the Shandy, you can also try the Radler , another (and very similar) drink that combines light beer with sparkling lemonade or lemon-lime soda. Though exact recipes and proportions can differ, the primary difference is simply one of language: Shandy is the British term, while Radler is used in Germany. Ask for either, and you’re likely to receive the same drink, though you may find certain bars employ other ingredients, like ginger or an alternative citrus. If you want to skip the step of making a Lemon Shandy for yourself, many breweries produce their own versions by mixing beer with lemonade or lemon soda, so it’s possible to stow a few cans in your bag the next time you require refreshing beverages at the beach or the park. 11 Beer Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lager beer'}, {'quantity': '8', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lemonade'}]","['In a pint glass, combine the lager and lemonade and stir briefly to combine.']",47,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-shandy/,Ginger Shandy,Liquor.com,"An ice-cold beer is nearly unsurpassed for its ability to refresh on a hot day, but only nearly. Add something like lemonade, ginger beer, or even a spirit, and it becomes a Shandy, a delightful, deeply refreshing concoction that’s popular throughout Europe. And while the most common recipe is a mix of lemonade and beer , the Ginger Shandy is one of the oldest versions. Simple to make and easy to drink, it’s a classic for a reason. It’s possible that the mixture of ginger beer (or ginger ale) and whatever beer the local public house was pouring was the first iteration of a Shandy, though mixing beer with other ingredients is as old as beer is itself. The combination grew in popularity during the mid-19th Century in England, when it was referred to as a “Shandygaff.” The origin of the name is unclear, and has led to continued speculation. What is clear, however, was the drink’s popularity, as it spread throughout the United Kingdom and beyond. Reportedly, the legendary author Charles Dickens was a great fan and declared that it would be absurd to drink anything else in summer. “In such a thermometrical state, no honest man drinks anything but shandy-graff,” he once wrote in a periodical. Eventually, the popularity of lemonade and beer overtook that of ginger ale and beer, while in Germany the Radler —which uses sparkling lemonade or a lemon soda—rules supreme. But the original combination of slightly sweet, slightly spicy ginger brews with a crisp, bright beer is a beloved drink, and deserving of the Shandy mantle. The Radler Is a German Classic 24 ratings Though some recipes insist on a wheat beer—which will amplify the juiciness of the drink—generally you’ll want to use a lager in order to achieve that crispness. Even cheaper, domestic canned lagers can be delicious in the drink, their more banal qualities converted to being purely “refreshing.” The choice of ginger drink also affects the final product. Use a ginger beer if you want something a little more cloudy, peppery and less carbonated. A ginger ale, on the other hand, will lead to something a little sweeter and more bubbly. The best way to figure out your perfect Ginger Shandy recipe is to mess around with different combinations of ginger sodas and lagers until you find the one that most hits the spot. Regardless of how you end up making it, the resulting drink is pure summertime in a glass, the perfect beverage to enjoy after a hike, a bike ride or just a long summer day doing nothing.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bunny-mary/,Bunny Mary,Liquor.com,"Besides the Mimosa, the Bloody Mary is the undisputed queen of the brunch cocktail world. Savory and spicy while still being refreshing, the iconic drink is known for its restorative qualities, as well as for providing the opportunity to garnish with enthusiasm. But not all Bloody Marys are the same: For this adaptation, the tomato juice is removed in favor of carrots, lemon juice, honey syrup and caper brine. The Bunny Mary—created by bartender Rob Krueger while working at the now-closed Extra Fancy in New York City—gets its playful name and vibrant hue from carrot juice, punched up with savory caper brine and a spicy cayenne-and-paprika rim for the glass. While vodka is the go-to for Bloody Marys and their many variations , the Scandinavian spirit aquavit makes an even more dynamic Bunny Mary. Botanicals like cardamom, caraway and dill pair beautifully with carrot, honey and hot sauce. Still, vodka makes a perfectly reputable Bunny Mary as well. It might seem counterintuitive to add honey syrup to a savory drink like one with carrot juice and caper brine. However, tomato juice is often sweetened, and the carrot juice used will likely need a little sweetener to punch it up. Meanwhile, the caper brine gives it some extra acidity (as does lemon juice), as well as a pungent saltiness. Crystal hot sauce, a vinegar-based hot sauce from Louisiana, has a moderate heat level, and with only a teaspoon added it won’t bring too much fieriness. If you’re the type who loves a seriously spicy Bloody Mary, you can always up the amount, or omit it entirely if making the drink for someone with low or no tolerance for heat. To finish, the Bunny Mary is garnished with a sprig of parsley to give it an even more carrot-like appearance. But as with any savory morning drink, half the fun is in the garnish, so feel free to embellish with the usual suspects like olives, celery and pickled asparagus—or with pickled carrots to maintain the theme. 3 Bloody Marys for People Who Don’t Like the Brunch Favorite FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Pimenton salt'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'aquavit'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'carrot juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'caper\xa0brine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'hot sauce'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'parsley sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Coat the rim of a Collins glass with the pimenton salt and fill with ice.', 'Combine the aquavit or vodka, carrot juice, honey syrup, lemon juice, caper brine and hot sauce in the glass and stir until chilled.

It’s cold, refreshing and lower-alcohol than a Bloody Mary , which is helpful when the goal is to enjoy some day-drinking without going overboard. Shannon’s Sangrita/Michelada (named for creator Shannon Ponche of Clover Club and Leyenda in New York City) is a unique twist on the classic that begins with Ponche’s homemade carrot-papaya sangrita. Sangrita is a nonalcoholic beverage that often features orange or lime juice, hot peppers and spices and is traditionally sipped alongside tequila. Ponche’s version features papaya puree, carrot, orange and lime juices, two types of chile powder and a dash of salt. It’s fruity, vegetal and spicy, acting as the perfect complement to Mexican beer. Once the sangrita is made, it is combined with fresh lime juice and a hearty pour of Negra Modelo, a medium-bodied lager with a rich and smooth taste.

There is, however, reason to combine the two into a synergistic drink that gives you the best of both worlds. Enter the Demi Peche, a beer cocktail by New Orleans bartender Thomas Thompson that’s part shandy, part radler. A shandy is beer mixed with lemonade or lemony soda—usually in equal parts—resulting in a beverage of ultimate refreshment. A radler is essentially the same thing, as it also combines beer with lemonade, citrus soda or juice. Typically low in alcohol, these light and refreshing drinks were popularized in Europe during the early 20th century and can still be found today in cans, in bottles and on draft. Back to the Demi Peche, Thompson begins with wheat beer, dosing it with a measure of peach syrup, which he makes by caramelizing ripe peaches and then combining them with sugar and water. While shandies and radlers tend to feature large pours of the fruit component, the Demi Peche calls for one ounce of the concentrated, sweetened peach syrup. That’s all you need for a fresh and fruity drink. Mix one yourself for backyard gatherings, porch swing sessions and other warm-weather activities. 11 Beer Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '12', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'wheat beer'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demi peche syrup'}]","['Add the beer and syrup into a pilsner glass.', 'Stir gently and briefly to combine.']",0,

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/beton/,Beton,Liquor.com,"One of the more thrilling aspects of the current global bartending scene is the proliferation and spread of once-obscure liqueurs throughout the world. Take Becherovka , for instance. The herbal, botanical liqueur has been a native spirit of the Czech Republic since 1805, technically longer than the independent country itself has been around. Despite its vaunted history, exports of the liqueur were severely restricted until recent years, with Pernod-Ricard launching the product in the United States starting in 2011. And while it is available now stateside, it’s still much more popular in the Czech Republic than anywhere in the U.S. “Everyone here, young or old, male or female, has some experience with Becherovka,” says Filip Stransky of the AnonymouS concept bars in Prague. “People drink it to celebrate and to mourn and to toast highs and lows. It’s part of our history.” The arrival of Becherovka in the States brought with it the Beton, the signature highball of Prague. “We drink Becherovka in a traditional drink called the Beton, which was first published in 1967,”  Stransky says. “It’s a twist on a Gin & Tonic .” Like the iconic G&T, the Beton is a simple concoction—just Becherovka, tonic water, and a wedge of lemon rather than lime. But also like the Gin & Tonic, its sum eclipses its parts, as the tonic water accentuates the unique elements of the Czech liqueur. Notes of cinnamon, ginger and licorice mingle with the quinine bittersweetness of the tonic water for a refreshing, bracing highball. For those who want to add even more complexity and botanicals to the drink, there is precedence with a slight variation to the Beton.  “...because we love a bitter taste, we are also adding Aperitiv KV14,” says Stransky. “Add this [to the tonic highball] and you have a Beton Bitter.” KV14 is an offshoot product in the Becherovka portfolio—red-hued, clocking in at 40% ABV and more potently bitter with no sugar added. A splash atop your Beton goes a long way to transforming the drink. Still, KV14 is definitely not nearly as available as Becherovka in most markets, and the uniqueness of the liqueur means there’s no clear substitute. Because of this, you may have to make do with the Beton, rather than the Beton Bitter. But one sip and you’ll know there’s nothing wrong with that. Fan of Fireball?

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/curiosity-killed-the-cat-you-know/,"Curiosity Killed the Cat, You Know",Liquor.com,"When it comes to wintery cocktails, it’s hard to top the Hot Toddy . Whether it’s an après ski libation, a treatment for a winter cold, or just for sipping in front of a warm fire, it’s difficult to beat the simple joy of a warm, boozy drink. Usually when making a hot drink like a Toddy, one reaches for the darker spirits: whiskey, most obviously, though brandy and even aged rums all make for an excellent base for hot drinks. More uncommon, then, is the use of gin. While this juniper-flavored spirit doesn’t see much in the way of hot drinks, it can work well, as exemplified by the Curiosity Killed the Cat, You Know. This heavily botanical drink comes from McLain Hedges of Morin in Denver, and contains a few more obscure ingredients than your average Hot Toddy. For starters, while the use of gin is already uncommon, Hedges uses a very particular one at that: Monkey 47 , named for the fact that it has 47 different botanicals, whereas most gins tends to have around a dozen. Some of these botanicals are hand-foraged in the Black Forest, adding even more wintery notes to the drink. Besides the gin, it also calls for génépy—an herbal alpine liqueur that suits a hot drink like this well— and Macvin du Jura, a fortified wine from Eastern France. Chamomile tea adds even more botanical depth, for a lush, complicated winter drink. “This cocktail celebrates the roads less traveled and the curious flavors you find through the high mountains of Germany, France and Italy,” says Hedges, “The Macvin du Jura [liqueur wine] is floral and honeyed, with light tannin that helps to carry the cocktail. The génépy is herbal and sweet, lifting and adding depth at the same time.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-lookout/,The Lookout,Liquor.com,"The Hot Buttered Rum is a classic albeit controversial cocktail. On the one hand, its rich and warming qualities are enjoyed by hordes of drinkers each winter season. But on the other, the inclusion of butter, if not properly incorporated, can quickly disrupt the flavor and texture. David Embury fell squarely in the negative camp, and he even dedicated a scathing section to the drink in his 1948 book “ The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks .” He wrote: “The lump of butter is the final insult. It blends with the hot rum just about as satisfactorily as warm olive oil blends with Champagne!"" The best Hot Buttered Rums, however, are comforting revelations. And there’s more than one way to interpret the drink. Bartender Beau du Bois created The Lookout, his version of the cocktail, while working at The Corner Door in Culver City, California. He maintains the core tenets of the classic—rum, butter and heat—but he specifically uses 12-year-old rum. And in a fun turn of events, he adds Pedro Ximenez sherry and mulled cider to the mix. The PX sherry isn’t simply dumped into the glass. Instead, it’s infused with softened butter. And while the original Hot Buttered Rum recipe calls for plain old boiling water, du Bois brings more flavor to the equation with mulled cider. You can use a high-quality store-bought cider, or try making your own by merging apple cider with mulling spices, like cinnamon, cloves, star anise and ginger. It’s a shame that Embury never got to try this recipe.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tea-sympathy/,Tea & Sympathy,Liquor.com,"There’s something about the warming combination of tea and liquor that works so well as a drink in winter. And while the most commonly associated spirits with the colder months are likely whiskey and brandy, this charming concoction instead uses cachaça, Brazil’s favorite spirit. Like rum, cachaça is made with sugarcane; however, unlike many rums, it is made with pure sugarcane instead of molasses, putting it in a similar category to rhum agricole and the rums from Guatemala. Rarely aged, the drink is one of the most popular spirits in the world due to its consumption in the populous country of its origin, Brazil. While delicious on its own over some ice or just in a glass, its most popular form is in the shape of a Caipirinha , Brazil’s national drink. In it cachaça is enhanced with some lime and sugar—it’s not unlike a Daiquiri , though it’s usually made with full slices of lime shaken directly in the drink, then the whole thing is poured into a glass, ice and all. Most cachaças have a fruity, grassy flavor to them, not uncommonly with notes of lychee or stone fruit. This recipe calls for Avuá Cachaça , a well-regarded cachaça made by one of Brazil’s few female distillers, but feel free to substitute it with another cachaça of your choice. Whatever you use, it brings a lot of brightness to the party and contrasts with the warm spices of Chai. As for the Chai, any tea bag will do the trick, but if you want to up the flavor a bit try using a loose-leaf blend of your favorite spiced tea. While the Chai brings a lot of the spice and pepperiness to the drink, King’s Ginger Liqueur adds even more ginger bite as well as some sweetness. A high quality liqueur made with real macerated ginger and some citrus oil, it makes for a nice addition to any liquor collection.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/temple-toddy/,Temple Toddy,Céline Bossart,"Not only a tool for making soups and chiles, a crockpot can also be used to make drinks . Award-winning bartender Steven Gonzalez of The Living Room at Park Hyatt in New York City was inspired by a trip to Ireland when he created the Temple Toddy. He was also influenced by his love of tropical climes, bringing a twist to the traditional Hot Toddy with the addition of mango. The Temple Toddy’s base is a fruity infusion—along with the mango, Gonzalez includes a whole apple and a lemon, as well as the necessary herbal ingredients like cinnamon, ginger and star anise. The fruit and herbs are slow cooked over the course of an hour, softening them so they can be macerated into a kind of rich, hot juice. The Irish whiskey is only added at the very end (along with a bit of honey for sweetness), rather than spending any time in the crock pot itself. That way, it never loses any integrity or flavor. For the whiskey portion, Gonzalez uses the ubiquitous and affordable Jameson Irish Whiskey, but another good quality Irish whiskey can take its place, if desired. And while it will certainly change the drink from its original form, substituting your favorite spirit can also work—however it’s wise to stick to the darker, aged spirits like brandy, rum or another whiskey to maintain the lush depth of the Temple Toddy. 4 Warming Crock-Pot Cocktail Recipes to Try at Home RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup, sliced', 'ingredient': 'granny smith apple'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'fruit (2-3/8"" dia)', 'ingredient': 'lemon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'fruit without refuse', 'ingredient': 'mango'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'piece', 'ingredient': 'ginger'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'pod', 'ingredient': 'star anise'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'stick', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon sticks'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'stick', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon stick'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'fruit (2-3/8"" dia)', 'ingredient': 'lemon'}]","['Peel and chop the apple, lemon, mango and ginger.', 'Add the apple, lemon, mango, ginger, star anise, cinnamon sticks and 32 ounces water into a Crock-Pot.

Similarly, the brandy he uses is Lustau’s brandy de Jerez, a type of brandy made in the solera system. If you switch things up you’ll want to stick to Spanish brandies, preferably in the solera style, if you want your Fallen Leaf to taste like Esler’s version. Far more spiced than other versions of the Hot Toddy, the Fallen Leaf includes ginger liqueur and allspice dram; and if that weren’t enough, rather than the normal hot water, it uses a cinnamon and lemon-infused hot water. And instead of simple syrup, it takes the warming and aromatic sweetener of honey syrup . Together, they give the drink a deep aroma of holiday spices, perfect for the cool seasons. But keep in mind this tipple proves strong, so it’s best to sip slowly, no matter how lovely it is.",[],"['Add the bourbon, brandy de Jerez, Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, St. Elizabeth allspice dram, honey syrup and lemon into a small Toddy mug.', 'Top with the cinnamon-lemon-infused hot water.', 'Garnish with a lemon wheel and grated nutmeg.']",4,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sweet-and-sour-chicken-toddy/,Sweet & Sour Chicken Toddy,Liquor.com,"While the vast majority of cocktails are served cold—either chilled in a shaker or served over ice—warm drinks like the Hot Toddy aren’t uncommon. In fact, a Toddy is often considered to be a consummate treatment for a cold. The other popular treatment for a cold is, of course, chicken soup, especially when it’s served with a bit of hot sauce. Historically, Gin & Juice has not been commonly used to treat a cold, but bartender Christy Pope of Cuffs & Buttons and Dallas’ Midnight Rambler turns it into a Hot Toddy and mixes it with sweet and sour chicken soup in this unconventional drink. While deeply odd on paper, the Sweet & Sour Chicken Toddy will turn your sick day into a party in the best way possible. Pope’s original recipe for the chicken-based hot cocktail calls for Swanson organic free-range chicken broth—shoppers can find this ubiquitous product on grocery store shelves almost anywhere. However, if you’re really dedicated to making this unusual drink, using a homemade chicken stock will invariably lead to better tasting results. It also means you can better control the flavor profile, like making it more or less salty or adjusting specific ingredients to better pair with gin and pineapple—adding extra ginger would work well, for instance. Rather than pineapple juice, Pope adds pineapple syrup, which can also be used in drinks like the Point Reyes Punch and the Mrs. Robinson . Lime juice adds its signature tartness and a dash of Sriracha (or other hot sauce if you desire) adds a restorative heat. Pope also makes a point to heat each of the ingredients on the stove besides the gin, adding the spirit only after everything else comes up to temperature to avoid cooking off the alcohol.","[{'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Swanson organic free-range chicken broth'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Sriracha'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Beefeater gin'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'star anise pod', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a small pot on the stove, combine the chicken broth, pineapple syrup, lime juice and Sriracha over medium heat.', 'Once the liquid starts to steam, remove from heat and add the gin.', 'Pour the heated cocktail into a Toddy glass.', 'Garnish with a star anise pod.']",0,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bone-and-bacon/,Bone & Bacon,Liquor.com,"Infused bourbons are nothing new. Whether it’s chocolate, coffee, fruit or spices, letting a bottle of bourbon rest with some flavoring agents is a fun new take on a familiar drink. One popular item in recent years with which to infuse bourbon is everyone’s favorite breakfast meat: bacon. Those who can’t resist a smoky cocktail or order the first drink on the menu promising a garnish of cured meat should stir up the Bone & Bacon, a four-ingredient bacon and beef-flavored bourbon drink by Denver bartender Dylan Holcomb. Rather than going through the trouble of infusing pork products into whiskey yourself, the recipe for Holcomb’s drink includes Ol’ Major Bacon Flavored Bourbon . Released in 2016, this Tennessee bourbon has received positive press for its smoky, meaty flavors mixed with quality bourbon. It provides the bacon part of the Bone & Bacon, but the other half is a bit more labor intensive. For the savory ice cubes, Holcomb uses a bone broth from the Osso Good Company , specifically its bison bone broth. If that’s not available, another bone broth can be substituted, but it’s important to use beef, bison or something equivalent; using anything like chicken or turkey will throw off the flavor profile, and using a pork bone broth runs the risk of taking the drink to over-porked levels. However, the ice cubes don’t actually go into the final product; instead they’re stirred with it, infusing the drink with flavor while chilling it. Once you’ve made them, though, you can try using them in another drink like a Bloody Mary to add even more umami notes, or in a drink like a Bourbon Old Fashioned for extra depth and savoriness. The Bone & Bacon is essentially a Manhattan , but rather than sweet vermouth it gets Averna , a lovely, bittersweet amaro from Sicily. Additionally, rather than the traditional Angostura bitters found in a Manhattan, the Bone & Bacon calls for black walnut bitters, which add an additional richness to the already robust drink. And to really drive home the carnivorous nature of the beverage, it’s garnished with a baby back rib bone rather than a cherry or orange zest.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': ""Ol' Major Bacon bourbon""}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Averna amaro'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'black walnut bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Osso Good bison bone broth ice cubes'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'medium rib', 'ingredient': 'baby back rib'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass.', 'Add the broth ice cubes, and stir approximately 30 times.', 'Strain into a coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a baby back rib bone.']",0,bourbon

He created a duck-stock-based drink that you can make at home. Stocks-tails are a fun trick to have in your arsenal, whether you just want to repurpose some scraps from dinner or you’re looking for a hearty drink to warm you up during winter. If you’re up for it, make duck stock at home using a simple recipe from leftover bones, vegetables and herbs—plenty are available online. But if you want to save some time, you can use store-bought bone broths for all your stock-tail needs. Dubbed the Duck Hunt, Rivera’s cocktail requires a few simple steps to get the stock just right, like adding an egg white to help filter out the particles.

It’s more than just a play on words: It’s also a delicious seasonal cocktail. Teague combines hot Earl Grey tea with aged rum, falernum (a sweet, spicy and nutty liqueur) and DIY butternut squash butter, which is made from squash puree and butter and loaded with baking spices, including nutmeg, allspice and cloves. Maple syrup is added straight into the glass at the end, so the drink can be sweetened to taste. The resulting cocktail is rich, warm and silky, with notes of florals from the tea. This union of autumnal ingredients is perfect for fall or winter, when you want to embrace gourd season by drinking a pumpkin cocktail , not by resorting to drinking a pumpkin spice latte sourced from your nearest coffee shop.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cobras-fang/,Cobra’s Fang,Alex Frane,"The Mai Tai , the Painkiller , the Zombie : Tiki has many signature drinks. But one lesser-known—but no less delicious—concoction is the Cobra’s Fang. Like many Tiki inventions, this one is a creation of Don the Beachcomber , most likely in 1937. While it dropped in popularity for a long while, in recent years it’s starting to see a resurgence thanks to its intoxicating mix of Guyanese and Jamaican rums, fruit juices, syrups and botanicals. One reason for its relative obscurity was that it calls for fassionola syrup. Popular in the early part of the mid-century and during Tiki’s heyday, it was reportedly an ingredient in the original Hurricane recipes, though like with all things Tiki, there’s debate. Normally bright red, it’s made from a blend of different fruits, often including passionfruit, papaya, cherries, guava, pineapple and citrus. Recipes vary from bartender to bartender, and a number of companies now produce their own takes, the oldest-known producer being the The Jonathan English Company. Some modern Cobra’s Fang recipes swap it for grenadine or, even worse, Hawaiian Punch. These should be ignored. Another element of the drink that has been, at times, difficult to get one’s hands on is 151-proof demerara rum, the most famous labels of which are Lemon Hart 151 and Hamilton. This high-proof Guyanese rum is complex, slightly smoky and rich, and pairs beautifully with aged Jamaican rum, which is also included in the Cobra’s Fang. In addition to the fassionola syrup, the drink is sweetened by falernum. Another popular Tiki ingredient, falernum is generally a syrupy, low-alcohol liqueur, though there are alcohol-free syrups called falernum as well. In any case, it generally contains ginger, lime, allspice and clove. Besides the Cobra’s Fang, falernum is essential for drinks like the Zombie, Corn ’n’ Oil and the Saturn . Along with lime and orange juices, the Cobra’s Fang also includes a dash each of absinthe and Angostura bitters, which give the drink an added layer of complexity and botanicals. Then the drink is flash-blended, though it can be shaken with ice and served over crushed or cracked ice. Either way, it needs the usual Tiki embellishments of a lime and mint garnish. Beware, though: Once you’ve been bitten by the Cobra’s Fang, you might get hooked on its venom. 9 Blast from the Past Drinks You Should Know RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'dark Jamaican rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': '151-proof demerara rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'falernum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'fassionola\xa0syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the dark Jamaican rum, demerara rum, falernum, lime juice, orange juice, fassionola syrup, absinthe and bitters into a blender with 6 ounces of crushed ice and blend for 5 seconds.', 'Pour into a highball glass or tall Tiki mug.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel and a mint leaf.']",23,rum

The Cuban classic, a potent but delicious mix of rum, sugar, mint, lime and club soda, has spent decades as an iconic beachside-sipper . But if the drink isn’t refreshing and summery enough in its normal form, there’s always the option to throw the whole lot in a blender. The Frohito is a rich and frothy take on the classic, and arguably even easier to make than the labor-intensive base recipe. This riff comes from bar legend Jeff “Beachbum” Berry , a prominent Tiki historian and owner of the famed New Orleans Tiki spot Latitude 29 . Like with any Mojito or its variations, the choice of rum will influence the final product. Using a Cuban rum is always a good option for authenticity; however, the availability of Cuban rums is unreliable at best, given the continued sanctions against their importation to the United States. Instead, white rums like Cana Brava, Plantation 3 Star white rum and Cruzan aged light rum are all viable, affordable alternatives. One change to the recipe is the use of a mint syrup rather than time spent muddling the mint and sugar in the glass. While this does add prep time, it also means once the mint syrup is made, the overall time to make the drink is lessened. Furthermore, the mint syrup can be used in other drinks, especially a drink like a Mint Julep to cut down on preparation time there.

From ripe peaches to berries and corn, farmers markets are packed and grocery stores rich with the abundance of the harvest. Of course, all of this ensures good eating, but it’s not the only way to enjoy the bounty of summer, as you can also drink it. And while peach and corn together may seem a bit odd (though not entirely), when it’s in the form of peach-infused bourbon, it’s hard to beat. Hailey’s Comet comes from Hailey Coder, the lead bartender at The Park Bistro & Bar at the Lafayette Park Hotel in Lafayette, California. After she topped some fresh local peaches with a big dollop of Chantilly cream, the bar team began brainstorming ingredient combinations, from almond, vanilla and honey to lemon juice and blackberries. Coder mingles all of them in this decadent summer sipper that thankfully can be a more frequent indulgence than Halley’s Comet, its similarly named astronomical occurrence. “Peaches are in season toward the end of summer and partner perfectly with bourbon,” she says. “You can imagine peaches, blackberries, almond and cream combining to make a perfect dessert, so why not a cocktail?” Because the recipe calls for infusing an entire bottle of bourbon, you’ll have plenty leftover once you’ve made a few rounds of Hailey’s Comet.

But those drinks too seldom include whiskey. Whether the bottle is bourbon or rye or hailing from Scotland or Ireland, whiskey is often pushed to the back of the bar and replaced by clear spirits like white rum, gin, vodka and blanco tequila. This holds especially true when blenders are involved. But Carlos Ramos would like to change that. Ramos is the bar manager at Villa Azur in Miami, a hotspot for dining, drinks, entertainment, music and art in a distinct space that combines the atmosphere of South Beach with that of Mediterranean France’s La Côte d’Azur. He channels the atmosphere with his Miamian’s Julep, a fresh take on the classic Mint Julep that was inspired by the tropical vibes, culture and eternal summer of Miami. “The bourbon complements the refreshing mint flavor to give you something that stimulates the senses and quenches your bourbon craving,” he says. Juleps are proof that ice-cold whiskey drinks belong front-and-center during summer. The Miamian’s Julep is no exception, but it’s not your typical julep. It includes the required whiskey and mint, but it adds coconut cream and creme de banane (French banana liqueur) to the mix, plus a dash of fresh lime juice to balance the sweetness. The ingredients are blended with ice to create a slushy, green-hued drink that’s loaded with flavor.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/tennessee-summertide/,Tennessee Summertide,Liquor.com,"Sarah Turbett, a musician and bartending expert in Nashville, Tennessee, came up with the idea for this brain-freeze-inducing cocktail while thinking about her favorite flavors of summer and fall growing up in Tennessee. “Tennessee whiskey, summer peach and vinegar notes brighten up fall spices, orange peel and licorice, transporting your palate from the warm end of summer to the early crisp autumn breeze,” she says. “Light enough to enjoy during the heat but complex enough to hold up to a piece of pumpkin pie, this cocktail is the perfect drink for the end of summer. Imagine sipping on this frozen cocktail on your porch in a great wooden rocking chair, watching the sun go down in a golden sky over amber fields.” Frozen cocktails are somewhat of an art form in that achieving the perfect texture (and ensuring that it won’t turn to liquid right away) is a feat when working with alcohol over a certain proof, which won’t actually freeze at the temperature of a standard freezer (usually around zero degrees Fahrenheit). That said, spirits certainly won’t maintain an icy texture on their own for very long at room temperature or higher, so striking a balance in both chemical makeup and flavor with a cocktail’s non-alcoholic or low-proof ingredients is key. Turbett’s preparation method is extra icy, too, for good measure—blending the drink with a cup of ice and serving it over a cup of fresh ice means that you can sip this Southern belle on a wraparound porch in late August without worry.

But, as creative bartenders keep showing everyone, there’s more than one way to mule. The classic drink provides a template for countless others, from rum mules to the bourbon-spiked Kentucky Mule , plus versions that incorporate berries and herbs. And then there’s the Montego Mule, Justin Golash’s icy homage to drinking on the beach in Jamaica. The Washington, D.C., bartender skips the mule’s typical ginger beer and instead uses freshly juiced ginger and a homemade spice syrup to flavor and lengthen the cocktail. That syrup adds complex and aromatic accents, including cardamom, coriander, ancho powder and eucalyptus, plus the fresh citrusy note of orange zest. “It’s a great summer slushie because the heat from the ginger and ancho powder contrasts against the bright acidity of the lime juice, giving a very refreshing flavor,” he says of the blended drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cabana-club/,Cabana Club,Caroline Pardilla,"Yael Vengroff, the beverage director at The Spare Room in The Hollywood Roosevelt and the 2018 Spirited Awards American Bartender of the Year, created this coconut-sherry liquid sunshine. The drink is simple and yet more layered than your standard patio pounder. It compels its drinker through a journey of creamy coconut, rounding it out with the nuttiness of amontillado sherry, holding attention with herbaceous absinthe and then bringing it home with cinnamon spice. “My goal is: How do I make something so incredibly simple but next-level mind-blowing also?” says Vengroff. The idea for the Cabana Club first came to Vengroff years ago in her hometown of Houston when she survived a particularly hot summer by drinking sherry and coconut water. And that combination, which she calls her desert island go-to, married perfectly with one of her favorite cocktails, a Prohibition-era Bahamian classic, Sky Juice, also known as the Gully Wash . “I loved that flavor profile,” she says. “And I just took those two ideas and merged them.” Even though this coconut drink is ideal for summer, it transitions seamlessly into fall. “It’s definitely not your May summer cocktail, which is more like watermelon fizz,” says Vengroff. “It’s guiding you toward warm, complex flavors that you typically experience in the fall or winter but still retaining that delectable-treat aspect.” Sky Juice RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'amontillado sherry'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Pernod absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Coco Lopez cream of coconut'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coconut water'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'The Perfect Puree coconut'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'shredded coconut', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'edible orchid', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the amontillado sherry, absinthe, cream of coconut, coconut water, coconut puree and cinnamon syrup into a blender with 3/4 cup crushed ice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bath-time/,Bath Time,Liquor.com,"When husband-and-wife duo Takuo and Sumire Miyanohara opened Bar Orchard in Tokyo’s upscale Ginza neighborhood in 2007, they introduced the city to an entirely new concept. The 16-seat cocktail den hinged around creative drinks made from a mountain of fresh fruit. “Ten years ago, when we started our business, nobody used fresh fruits for cocktails, except for lemon, lime, orange and grapefruit,” says Sumire. The high cost of quality fruit in Japan made it challenging for bars to afford to make such drinks. Since then, bars have changed their operation models to include fresh fruit, and now bars regularly serve drinks that highlight in-season fruits, including berries and melons. That significant change has resulted in countless incredible cocktails across Japan, including this one. With its bathtub vessel and rubber ducky, the Bath Time is an eye-catching drink. But most important, it’s tasty and well-balanced. It merges tequila with sauvignon blanc, citrus and muscat grapes, which have a sweet, floral aroma and flavor. Everything is blended until smooth and combined with coriander and mint leaves for additional aromatics. The cocktail is then topped with salt foam, which is a fun but optional component if you’re making the drink at home. If you don’t have a bathtub-shaped glass (because why would you?), no worries: You can simply use a rocks glass or whatever else you have on hand. The drink might not go viral on Instagram, but it will still taste great.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/frozen-negroni/,Frozen Negroni,Liquor.com,"“Frosé is light, refreshing and fun, and everyone knows it,” says Matt Friedlander, the beverage director and general manager at Sweetwater Social in New York City. “But a frozen Negroni is also light, refreshing and fun, and packs a lot more booze into one drink.” You can’t argue with that. Frozen cocktails have their place, and that place is usually in your hand on a particularly hot day. Frosé , Frozen Margaritas and other ice-cold drinks can certainly get the job done, but there’s something genteel—and even a bit illicit—about sipping on a frozen Negroni. The classic Negroni (gin, Campari and sweet vermouth) is a cocktail aficionado’s favorite, and a drink you’ll find at every cocktail bar under the sun. Its assertive bitterness isn’t for everyone, and that’s part of the drink’s appeal. But blend it with a couple tweaks, and you’ve got a prime candidate for a patio sipper all summer long. To make his frozen Negroni, Friedlander starts with Caorunn, a small-batch Scottish gin that includes apples and berries in its botanical makeup. He eschews the typical equal parts ratio, instead opting to use two times the gin as his other primary ingredients. From there, he replaces the Campari with Aperol, which creates a more citrusy and less bitter cocktail, and chooses Carpano Antica Formula, a rich, well-rounded Italian vermouth. He also adds a few drops of grapefruit bitters to complement the gin and Aperol, as well as a pinch of salt which, just like in cooking, helps tie the flavors together. Blended with ice, the end result may look like a guilty pleasure you’d drink on the beach, but it provides the familiar Negroni flavors you want—with just the right amount of creative license. 6 Things You Should Know About the Negroni RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'salt'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all the ingredients to a blender with a handful of pebble ice.', 'Blend until well-incorporated, then pour into a double rocks glass.', 'Garnish with one peel each of orange and grapefruit, placed in the shape of an X in honor of Scotland’s flag.']",0,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/el-rey-del-patio/,El Rey del Patio,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to find a beer-based cocktail more beloved and famous than the Michelada . Like many other drinks, its origins are cloudy, though it very likely came from the Mexican tradition of serving light lagers with lime and salt; its name loosely translates to “my cold beer.” Its most famous application is midday football watching parties, paired with all the obligatory game day snacks like hot wings, sliders and ribs. While recipes often include tomato juice or Clamato, like a beer-based Bloody Mary or Bloody Caesar , more traditional versions omit the tomato. Instead, a potent mix of hot sauce, salt, Worcestershire sauce and citrus enhances the drink. The El Rey del Patio, from bartender Lucien Conner at Irvine, California’s Puesto hews more traditional. Basically the cocktail version of salsa verde, this riff gets its tangy, smoky, spicy flavor from blistered jalapeños and tomatillos, while cucumber and lime add brightness and a fresh note. Prepping the charred jalapeños is where the bulk of the work for this drink takes place. Though a little intimidating, it’s not too hard to do: Simply slice the peppers in half lengthwise and, optionally, core and remove the seeds. You’ll want to wear rubber or latex gloves during this procedure to avoid any errant burns. Once prepped, grill skin-side-up under a broiler, and, when cooled, peel the blackened skin off carefully with gloved hands or an implement. Roasting the peppers in this way helps soften some of the raw acerbic qualities and intense heat. Retaining the seeds will give the drink more kick, so adjust as preferred. Once you’ve made the puree for the drink it will stay for a few days in the fridge, so it’s advisable to make it the day before entertaining. Open a fresh bottle of beer for each drink, and serve the remainder of the bottle next to the glass so that your guests can refill as wished. The drink becomes more refreshing and beer-forward as it goes, which is part of the pleasure of any Michelada.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pale-horse-rickey/,Pale Horse Rickey,Liquor.com,"The Rickey is a classic cocktail that sprang to life during the late 19th century in Washington, D.C., when it was first mixed together at Shoomaker’s Bar for a lobbyist named Colonel Joe Rickey. Joe favored the Bourbon Rickey (bourbon, lime juice, sparkling water), while subsequent experimentation crowned the Gin Rickey as the most popular version of them all. The modern Pale Horse Rickey takes a different route, using mezcal as the drink’s base spirit. This twist was created by China Morbosa at Eveleigh in West Hollywood. Mezcal provides an earthy, smoky punch, while equal parts Manzanilla sherry and fresh lemon juice lend dryness, depth and citrusy tartness. Morbosa caps off the cocktail with a homemade mango-infused coconut water in place of traditional club soda. She makes it by cooking down coconut water with fresh mango and sugar and then carbonating the liquid with club soda. If you want to hew more traditional, you can make the Pale Horse Rickey with gin or whiskey. But considering that this drink contains mango-infused coconut water, you might as well embrace the liberal take on the classic and use mezcal.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/celtic-frappe/,Celtic Frappé,Liquor.com,"A frappé is an iced beverage (the word means “iced” in French) that has been shaken or blended to produce a thick and foamy drink. It’s served cold and is often sweetened with sugar, syrups or whipped cream. You’ve likely seen the term in coffee shops—just think of the Frappucino—but you can also enjoy alcohol-spiked frappés in bars or at home. The Celtic Frappé takes the concept to interesting new heights by utilizing a blend of boozy ingredients, lime juice and orange sherbet to create a refreshing cocktail. It begins with Celtic Honey, a liqueur made from Irish whiskey, honey and spices. That flavorful start is then complemented by a couple of French ingredients: Dolin Blanc, a subtle and floral vermouth, and Pernod pastis, an anise-flavored aperitif. To round it all out, lime juice lends some acidity, while Peychaud’s bitters provide a dash of complexity. But it’s the unexpected addition of orange sherbet that really sets this cocktail apart, giving it a sweet and creamy element. Once all the components are shaken together and strained over crushed ice, you’re left with a fresh and delicious cocktail that’s bursting with flavor.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rooster-tail/,Rooster-Tail,David Wondrich,"It was during the darkest days of the Civil War. The spring of 1863. With the Union Army still licking its wounds from its disastrous defeat at Fredericksburg the previous December, President Lincoln had just been forced to institute a draft, a measure that did nothing to help his popularity. Meanwhile, Robert E. Lee’s army was cold and hungry, and he couldn’t see a way to actually win the war. With both sides dispirited and demoralized and no end to the slaughter in sight, you’d think they’d try again to get together to talk things out. They almost did. On April 1 of that grim year, two men happened to ride up at the same time to a rural tavern in one of those corners of the Maryland countryside that no army particularly wanted. Neither of them young, they shared the hard-bitten look of men accustomed to tough decisions and issuing orders that did not make them happy. Neither, however, was wearing any sort of uniform. The strangers exchanged simple courtesies, tied up their horses and stepped inside. The owner—one Geoffrey Morningvale, if his sign was to be believed—leaned forward on the bar and spoke the eternal phrase, “Gentlemen, what will it be?” “I’ll trouble you for one of those, brother barkeep,” said the taller of the two men in a reedy voice that echoed the forests of Kentucky. He pointed at the little paper placard hanging behind the bar. “Morningvale Rooster-Tail, 50¢” it read. The other man, whose soft tones carried the warmth of the Mississippi sun, ventured that he might as well try the same. Bottles were uncapped, liquids poured in rainbow arcs, ice chipped, mint spanked and bitters dashed. There was a mighty shaking, a gurgling through a silver strainer and before long the two travelers were sipping their Rooster-Tails with much smacking of the lips and sighs of satisfaction. Another round was ordered. Their conversation turned to the war. Couldn’t see any point in continuing it, really. Neither one of them. It was remarkable the extent to which they agreed. The more Rooster-Tail they drank, the more their ideas harmonized. Who knows how far their agreement would have gone, under the influence of those delightful, delightful Rooster-Tails? Unfortunately, before Morningvale’s creation got to cement its accomplishment, a young rider in blue pulled up in front of the little tavern. Recognizing one of the horses, he shouted, “Mr. President, Mr. President, come quick! There’s Rebel cavalry out!” With that, the Kentuckian reluctantly set his (empty) glass aside, thanked his companion for the conversation, paid the barkeeper and let his long legs carry him out. Moments later a cavalryman in butternut gray dashed in. “President Davis, sir! Thank God! There are Yankees everywhere; we must fly.” If only they’d had just one more round, 150 April 1sts ago... Editor’s Note: Check the date on this story. April Fool’s! No, Lincoln and Davis never met over cocktails.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/lagerita/,Lagerita,Liquor.com,"There’s something about the pairing of a Margarita with an icy cold Mexican lager. Having them side by side, maybe on a sandy beach or a grassy backyard, is outrageously refreshing and delicious. So it may come as no surprise that mixing the two into a single drink works remarkably well, as odd as it might sound. The Lagerita, from bartending veteran, distiller and consultant Simon Ford (creator of Ford’s Gin), does exactly that, topping a pretty traditional Margarita with a light and crisp Mexican beer. Beer is an uncommon cocktail ingredient, though it has its place in Shandies , the Michelada and a variety of other drinks . It brings carbonation and brightness while diluting the flavors less than club soda does, and in a Margarita it punches up the refreshing qualities of the famed sour. It’s important to use a light lager. A beer like Modelo works perfectly, but you could substitute Corona, Pacifico or Tecate. Using an ale like an IPA will add too much bitterness and malt, while a style like a stout or porter will overwhelm the other flavors (not to mention give the drink an unpleasant color). As with any Margarita, the choice of tequila is up to the maker (or drinker). Generally you’ll want to go with a quality silver tequila, but you don’t need to reach for the top-shelf brands, especially as you’ll be adding beer. But be sure to avoid ones that aren‘t made with 100% agave, as is common practice when selecting any tequila. Similarly, while Cointreau is the orange liqueur of choice for most Margaritas—and is the one that Ford uses in the Lagerita—you can swap it for a more affordable one, like a good dry curaçao or other nice orange liqueur. However, be sure to taste for the proper sweetness level so you can adjust with some additional simple syrup if need be. 11 Beer Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Salt'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Modelo Especial beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['If desired, coat the rim of a highball glass with salt, fill with ice and set aside.', 'Add the tequila, Cointreau and lime juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the prepared glass.', 'Top with the beer.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",45,tequila

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/autumn-apple/,Autumn Apple,Liquor.com,"Normally when bartenders create a drink in the spirit of the fall season they turn towards darker spirits, favoring whiskeys, dark rums and brandies, especially pear and apple brandy . However, that’s not always the case, as the Autumn Apple exemplifies. This gin drink comes from bartender Chris Chamberlain and in it autumn’s favorite flavor takes center stage with a festive mix of apple cider, gin, honey syrup and cinnamon. For the base spirit, Chamberlain uses Bluecoat American dry gin . Rather than the traditional London dry gin with its juniper-heavy flavor profile, the Pennsylvania-made Bluecoat American gin has more citrus and floral notes, and holds back on the juniper. Trouble is, the copper-distilled Bluecoat American can be difficult to acquire outside of Pennsylvania. If you’re unable to get your hands on it, you can switch it out for a more traditional London dry, or try the Autumn Apple with other styles of gin like Aviation, another American dry gin that leans less on juniper. These brighter, more citrus-forward gins like the Bluecoat will pair better with the apple cider, which notably should be a fresh-squeezed, and not a sparkling, alcoholic cider. This will better evoke the lush flavors of autumn, regardless of the time of year the cocktail is being imbibed. Essentially an apple cider take on a gin sour, the drink also calls for lemon juice, while honey syrup takes the place of simple syrup. This, too, gives the drink a darker, more autumnal tone without making it overly sweet or cloying. Cinnamon—a fairly uncommon cocktail ingredient outside of the cinnamon syrups often used in Tiki drinks—adds even more warmth and depth. But it is important to use restraint when adding a pinch, as too much can overpower the drink and make it cloudy.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/perfect-pear/,Perfect Pear,Liquor.com,"When the weather gets cooler and the leaves turn vivid reds, oranges and yellows, many bartenders reach for darker spirits for their drinks, especially whiskey. But fall cocktails don’t have to be dark, bittersweet affairs. Spirits like gin can also capture autumnal flavors, especially when paired with fall produce like apples or pears. Bartender Chris Chamberlain exemplifies this with his drinks the Autumn Apple and the Perfect Pear, both of which use Bluecoat American Dry Gin from Pennsylvania. The Perfect Pear sees a number of familiar combinations: gin and elderflower liqueur (most commonly St-Germain, though there are other brands) is a time-honored pairing, and Champagne is often found paired with both . With lemon juice adding tartness and fresh pear puree lending the autumnal notes and amplifying the fruitiness, it creates a bright, bubbly drink that still captures the feeling of the turning of the seasons. As with any drink, there are substitutions you can make if you cannot find some of the ingredients. Bluecoat, for instance, isn’t available in all markets, and another gin can stand in for it if needed. Still, it’s not the same as a traditional London dry gin like Tanqueray or Beefeater. Other American dry gins, like Aviation American Gin from Portland, Oregon, California’s St. George Terroir Gin and Louisville’s Copper & Kings American Dry Gin are all closer approximations, with herbs like coriander and citrus notes. Similarly, while Champagne is often called for in sparkling wine drinks like this, the single splash called for in the Perfect Pear makes it hard to justify popping the cork on a bottle of the world’s most famed sparkling wine. Instead, feel free to use an American sparkling wine (there are plenty of top-notch examples) or wines from other regions of the world that use the traditional method that Champagne is made with. You can even go with a bottle of prosecco or cava, though the brightness of those will affect the final product, so taste for balance before serving.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Bluecoat American Dry gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'fresh pear puree'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Champagne'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'slice', 'ingredient': 'pear'}]","['Add the gin, St-Germain, lemon juice, simple syrup and fresh pear puree to an ice-filled shaker and shake until chilled.', 'Double-strain into a coupe glass.', 'Top with a splash of Champagne and garnish with a fresh slice of pear.']",14,gin

That low-ABV base is kicked up a notch by pear eau-de-vie, which is simply a clear brandy distilled from pears. The one-two punch of wine and pear liquor gives the drink a fruity and floral character. To complement those components, Saunders adds zesty orange curaçao and rich honey syrup, plus five dashes of Peychaud’s bitters, which lend their trademark gentian and licorice notes to the mix. A star anise pod garnish enhances the aromas and further channels fall. To enjoy the full effects of this autumnal drink, put on a cozy sweater and shake one up as the leaves begin to change colors and litter the ground.

Originally made for the winter holidays, it combines aged cachaça with two types of rum, DIY matcha syrup, fresh lemon juice, pear juice and a mist of absinthe . Cachaça is similar to rum, but the native Brazilian spirit is distilled from 100 percent sugar cane juice rather than the more common molasses. Its flavors can range from sweet and fruity to dry, earthy and grassy. Many bottles are clear and unaged, while other versions—like the one employed in this recipe—see the inside of a barrel and take on deeper, more complex flavors. Avuá Bálsamo is aged for up to two years in burgundy-colored barrels made from bálsamo wood. It’s joined by Denizen (an aged blend of Trinidadian and Jamaican rums) and Smith & Cross Jamaican rum, which both sport rich and tropical flavors. Matcha syrup brings green notes to the party, balanced by fresh lemon juice and sweet pear juice. Before serving, coat your glass with a mist of absinthe.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/happy-pill/,Happy Pill,Liquor.com,"The Painkiller is a beloved warm-weather cocktail, a fruity and delicious mix of rum, pineapple and coconut that draws plenty of inspiration from the Piña Colada . It’s wildly popular at Tiki bars and relatively easy to put together, but the recipe is also open to tweaks and embellishments. The Happy Pill is one such take on the Painkiller, and comes from Chica in Las Vegas’ Venetian Hotel. As with drinks of this style, mixing a blend of rums for the base is the way to go. At Chica bartenders use Don Q Cristal and Plantation dark rum, two high-quality but very affordable rums. If you’ve got other rums on hand, feel free to use them, but stick with one clear rum and one darker, aged rum. Be sure to not go too dark—you’ll want to avoid a blackstrap, for instance. Painkiller 1285 ratings The Painkiller traditionally calls for cream of coconut, a sweetened, syrupy kind of coconut milk generally sold in cans—it’s also used in the Piña Colada. The Happy Pill also includes cream of coconut for sweetness and richness, but swaps some of it out for coconut liqueur. Specifically, it calls for Kalani, but there are alternatives, including a coconut rum liqueur from Rhum Clement, a celebrated brand. One small change leads to a big flavor difference. Rather than using pineapple juice from a can or squeezed from a fresh pineapple, the Happy Pill calls for roasted pineapple juice. The process is fairly simple, as you can easily grill some pineapple slices in a pan and then squeeze and strain them. However, the process greatly increases the depth of flavor by caramelizing some of the sugars and adding a bit of char. The rest of the drink is pretty similar to the Painkiller, calling for orange and lime juices, though there’s less orange here than normal. And, like its predecessors, the drink gets shaken and poured over pebbly crushed ice for a tall, refreshing cocktail that can last for a good while as you relax by the beach or pool.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Don Q Cristal rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Plantation dark rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Kalani coconut liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grilled pineapple juice*'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cream of coconut'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: cherry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: orange slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the white rum, dark rum, coconut liqueur, grilled pineapple juice, orange juice, lime juice and cream of coconut into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Pour into a highball glass over crushed ice.', 'Garnish with a skewered cherry and orange slice.', 'Dust with fresh grated nutmeg.']",11,rum

But he wasn’t a hard-drinking president. The Rough Rider enjoyed more coffee than cocktails. And during his attempt to win the 1912 Republican nomination for president, he famously sued a newspaper for libel for insinuating that he was a heavy drinker. Still, bartenders and the media enjoyed associating his name with a handful of drinks over the years. One cocktail, according to the Baltimore Sun, was served on Roosevelt’s arrival home after a 15-month expedition in British East Africa. The international drink contained Cuban rum, Italian vermouth, English gin, French absinthe and German kirschwasser and was served in a Venetian glass. Another Roosevelt-named cocktail included gin, Dubonnet, raspberry syrup and orange bitters. Whether the man himself actually consumed any of these drinks is less clear, but you certainly can. The below Roosevelt cocktail comes from Simon Ford, the co-founder of Ford’s Gin.

She created the drink while working as the beverage director at Lola in Louisville, Kentucky. It starts with bittersweet Aperol , adding absinthe, grapefruit shrub and sparkling wine to the mix. For that absinthe, she chooses locally produced Copper & Kings Absinthe Superior, which brings classic anise flavor, as well as floral and citrus notes. Shrubs , which are often referred to as drinking vinegars, are a great way to add fruit flavors to a cocktail. Most shrubs combine water, fruit, sugar and vinegar to create an acidic syrup that adds depth and complexity when mixed into drinks. In this case, Christiansen makes the shrub with grapefruit juice and zest, plus apple cider vinegar. “I enjoy using grapefruit in a shrub because it allows the brightness and flavor of the grapefruit to come through and cuts down on the typical tartness of the grapefruit,” she says. “Allowing the acid from the apple cider vinegar and the sugar to lift the grapefruit flavor [creates] a more complex grapefruit flavor.” The shrub is easy to make at home and only requires a few ingredients and about 20 minutes of cook time on the stove.

Get a batch started before friends arrive, then spoon into coffee mugs. Even relying on a slow cooker for much of the work, the recipe is in an intensive one, with an array of ingredients and implements.

Strega—an Italian liqueur with notes of mint and fennel—plus allspice dram and velvet falernum add even more rich spices and botanicals while raising the proof.

If you get the chance to drink slivovitz straight from the source, by all means, do so. But you can also find the popular spirit in a handful of U.S.-based bars and restaurants, like Baba , a lively all-day cafe in Arlington, Virginia. Baba’s menu features a few Eastern European spirits and cocktails, including the Monastery, a drink containing Maraska slivovitz, lime juice, honey syrup, plum jam and fresh basil leaves. Maraska hails from Croatia; its slivovitz is a kosher spirit made from blue plums, which are fermented for three months. The mash is distilled twice, and the resulting liquor is aged for a minimum of two years in oak casks. With brandy, citrus and sweetener, the Monastery is not so different from classics like the Sidecar or Brandy Crusta , though it has a flavor all its own.

His Pear & Pub Ale Party Punch calls on two spirits, two juices, a homemade syrup and some beer, so there’s a lot going on within. The punch begins with rye whiskey and dark rum. It’s a potent combo to be sure, but one with complementary flavors that work well together—rye’s natural spiciness merges with the rich dark rum to produce a boozy synergy. Orange and lemon juices provide a welcome vein of fresh citrus that runs through the cocktail, while cinnamon-pear syrup adds sweetness, complexity and spice. For the beer, Webb recommends a good English ale, like Lucky Town Pub Ale, which is brewed right in Jackson. Avoid anything too hoppy or too stout. While Webb’s recipe hits all the right notes, you can temper the ratios if the punch is too strong for your crowd. You can easily accomplish that by decreasing the spirits or increasing the amount of juice or beer, per your preference. Remember to prep the syrup in advance, so all you have to do is mix everything together right before the party begins.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/chai-tea-fizz/,Chai Tea Fizz,Liquor.com,"While chai lattes are regularly found at coffee shops and cafes across the country, rarely do they include any kind of alcoholic beverage. The Chai Tea Fizz isn’t going to appear on your local Starbucks menu anytime soon, nor even that hip coffeeshop down the street from the three other Starbucks. Luckily, it’s not a difficult drink to make at home. The base liquor for the Chai Tea Fizz is Bombay Sapphire East gin . While similar to the famous Bombay Sapphire, the East expression also includes two additional botanicals: lemon grass and black pepper. The peppery, citrusy and floral gin pairs well with the chai tea syrup that sweetens the drink, adding even more botanical complexity. As with any Gin Fizz , the drink is made with egg white, citrus and club soda, and then served “long,” which refers to it being served in a highball glass with no ice. This involves a dry shake first (all the ingredients save the club soda shaken with no ice), then a normal shake with ice to make sure the drink is especially cool before it gets poured in the glass and topped with the club soda. It’s important to be sure the soda is completed chilled, and it’s not a terrible idea to chill the highball glass, too.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/flinns-apres-steazy/,Flinn’s Après Steazy,Alex Frane,"Post-ski trip drinks developed as their own category in the latter part of the 20th century, though the classification of an après ski is loose. Often served hot (like the beloved Toddy ), though not always, the drinks are strong and intense, usually something bracing and invigorating after a day on the slopes. However, according to Jimmy Yeager—the owner of Jimmy’s An American Restaurant and Bar in the ski-obsessed city of Aspen, Colorado—the style’s popularity has waned recently. “The days of après everywhere are over compared to 20 to 30 years ago,” he says, explaining that high-speed lifts and other technologies have shortened the ski day, causing skiers to wrap up on the mountain earlier. Still, there’s plenty of room for delicious, spirit-forward, botanical drinks after finishing a day of skiing. Yeager’s favorite après cocktail is the Flinn’s Après Steazy. Created by and named for former Jimmy‘s bartender Flinn Pomeroy, Yeager says it evokes the surrounding area perfectly. “Like Aspen, this cocktail is highly cultured and at the same time very approachable.” The Après Steazy is unusual in that it uses an amaro as its base rather than as an embellishment. In particular, it calls for Lucano amaro . More than a century old, this Italian liqueur is a blend of 30-plus herbs and other botanicals. The cocktail is also bolstered with rye whiskey, and Pomeroy uses one from Woody Creek , a distillery in Basalt, Colorado, only 20 miles from Aspen. For those who can’t get their hands on a bottle, another American rye whiskey will fill in nicely. While the base is already an amaro, Pomeroy adds another, the famed bittersweet Italian liqueur Campari , which adds additional herbal notes to the drink. Its bitterness is balanced by St-Germain elderflower liqueur, and lemon juice brightens all of it, leading to a strong but balanced cocktail. “I chose it because it’s delicious and balanced,” says Yeager. “The amaro is fortified by the rye whiskey and balanced by the bitter and sweet of the Campari and St-Germain.” The History and Secrets of the Hot Toddy RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Lucano amaro'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Woody Creek rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Lucano amaro, rye whiskey, Campari, St-Germain and lemon juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.', 'Express the oil from a lemon twist over the drink and drop the twist into the drink to garnish.']",11,whiskey

They adorn doorsteps, festoon display windows and dominate restaurant tables, but these seasonal favorites are more than just decorations. Increasingly, bartenders are incorporating them into cocktails. One such cocktail is the Butter “Nut” Craig by D.C. bartender, bar owner and distiller Todd Thrasher. It combines dark rum and orange liqueur with butternut squash, fresh lemon juice and aromatic bitters. At first glance, rum might seem to be the key element in this cocktail—after all, it’s used in the highest quantity. But take one sip, and you’ll know that it’s the orange liqueur that steals the show. The cordial—you can use triple sec or orange curaçao, per your preference—deftly balances the winter squash’s earthiness with the rum’s spice and the glittery cinnamon-sugar rim. Rather than squash muddled in a shaker tin, the drink calls for a homemade butternut squash puree doctored with brown sugar, molasses and salt. It’s quick and easy to make, and if you scale up the recipe, you’ll have plenty of leftovers to make a few rounds for your guests during the holidays. Because anyone can serve butternut squash alongside some turkey, but a true host mixes it with rum and orange liqueur.

But sometimes you just want a simple drink that you can construct quickly with minimal ingredients. Your repertoire is probably stocked with a few easy favorites already, like the Gin & Tonic . But two-ingredient drinks run the gamut from spirit-and-mixer sips to less-boozy drinks like the Mimosa that combine orange juice with Champagne. Then there’s the Black Velvet, a merger of Guinness beer and sparkling wine that works better than its chief components might suggest. The Black Velvet has been around for a while. It was supposedly created in 1861 at Brooks’s Club in London (itself dating back to 1764) to honor the passing of Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert. The dark beer added a somber note to the usually festive Champagne. The drink couldn’t be easier to make. Pour some Guinness into a glass, top it with Champagne and you’re done. That’s the most common combination, but some people choose to skip the Champagne and use hard cider. Try it both ways to see which version you like best. It’s a fun experiment, and, hey, you need to finish that open beer anyway. And once you’ve gone down that road, you might as well make the Black & Tan next.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/early-start/,Early Start,Liquor.com,"The Early Start by Alex Negranza, the bar manager at Houston’s March Restaurant , is sure to make a striking impression when you serve it. Muddled sorrel leaf, orgeat and egg white give this aquavit sour a lush, foamy green hue and a silky texture. While often referred to as a Scandinavian equivalent of gin—it too being a neutral grain spirit flavored with herbs and other botanicals—aquavit producers have more liberty with the ingredients with which to flavor their spirits. Caraway is the most common, but aquavits can be infused with dill, fennel, coriander and other anise flavors. Because of this, using a different aquavit brand can alter the flavor profile of the Early Start. Negranza uses Krogstad aquavit , from Portland, Oregon, as the base of his drink. This readily accessible and moderately priced American aquavit is a popular choice amongst bartenders. However, it can be substituted with another caraway and star anise-forward aquavit. 10 Things You Didn’t Know About Aquavit RELATED ARTICLE The savory notes of the spirit are amplified by the addition of a French sorrel leaf, muddled into the drink. Unlike the handful of mint needed for a Mint Julep or Mojito , you’re only going to need one of these potent, herbaceous leaves for the drink, both for its sharp flavor and its verdant color. Lime juice adds acidity and brightness, which is balanced with the addition of orgeat instead of a more commonly used simple syrup. Orgeat is a nut-based syrup, generally made with almonds and often used in tiki bartending in drinks like the Mai Tai . Beyond sweetness, it also adds creaminess. The silkiness in the Early Start is amplified by the addition of egg whites, which, when vigorously shaken in the drink, add a suave mouthfeel and create a thick foam head. If you don’t eat egg whites, you can substitute it for aquafaba, the water from canned and cooked chickpeas. The subtle vegetal notes of the egg-white replacement work especially well in more savory drinks like the Early Start.

A deeply unconventional drink, it combines multiple ingredients including Irish whiskey , sherry, brandy and even Guinness. The result is complex, layered and decidedly Irish. The base of the True Blue is Tullamore D.E.W 12-year-old, an excellent and generally affordable Irish whiskey. You could substitute a bottle like Knappogue Castle or Powers if that’s what you have on hand. The cocktail also gets Clear Creek eight-year-old apple brandy from Hood River, Oregon. This delicate yet assertive apple brandy has its own defined flavor profile, but, if need be, the closest analogue would be an apple brandy from California’s St. George Spirits. Calvados or Applejack will taste noticeably different. Since it’s a stridently Irish drink, there is also a measure of Guinness, which adds chocolatey nuttiness and richness. The nuttiness is enhanced by a scant measure of Pedro Ximénez sherry, which rests on the sweeter side of the sherry spectrum . The sweetness is enhanced by an unconventional ingredient: white miso cane syrup. A bit of ginger syrup adds more complexity and a hint of spice, which is balanced with lemon juice. Finally, a few dashes of Peychaud’s bitters give the drink a subtle rosy hue and additional depth of flavor. The result is totally different than any other Irish whiskey drink out there, and though it takes a bit of effort to put together, it might become your new favorite St. Patrick’s Day tradition.

Some people choose to fly flags, while others blast “The Star-Spangled Banner.” You might even watch a few patriotic movies, like “Miracle” or “Independence Day.” But one of the best and most rewarding ways to honor the United States is with a refreshing cocktail. The Stars & Stripes pays homage to the American flag with red, white and blue ingredients. It calls for fresh blueberries, blueberry vodka, absinthe , fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, raspberry brandy, ginger beer and a sugar cube garnish. The blueberries are muddled in a shaker to release their color and juices and then shaken with the vodka, absinthe, lemon juice, simple syrup and ice. The drink is poured unstrained into a highball glass, so all those blueberry bits remain in the glass. The raspberry brandy is drizzled on top, lending a layered red hue, before the cocktail is topped with ginger beer and garnished with the sugar cube—consider that your white star. The Stars & Stripes is fruity, refreshing and tasty, walking a line between sweet and tart. The fresh berries and lemon juice add a burst of brightness to the blueberry vodka and raspberry brandy, and the absinthe brings a complex punch of anise that provides an unexpected twist in this otherwise straightforward recipe. Break out a tray of these at your next Fourth of July party or Memorial Day cookout, and you’ll have a themed drink that fits the occasion. Not only does it look the part, but the red-white-and-blue drink, with its vodka base, fresh fruit and spicy ginger beer, is exactly the type of cold, thirst-quenching cocktail you need on warm days.

All you really need to get started is a few pieces of basic equipment, including a carboy or jug, a cork and airlock, some food-safe sanitizers and some recipes. And while most home brewing involves making the traditional ales and lagers that define modern brewing, there are other recipes based on older, rarer styles of beer. This wintry Puritan-style brew is one such deviation from the norm. Based on a recipe from the 1840 cookbook “Directions for Cookery, in its Various Branches” by Eliza Leslie, it was adapted by culinary historian and author Sarah Lohman . Brewed with real spruce branches, hops, dark maple syrup and no grains, this beer is light, yeasty and dramatically different from modern beer. However, before getting started, Lohman suggests that would-be home brewers get some basic homebrewing practice. Her recommendation for those getting started is to purchase a one gallon home brew kit , which is what this recipe is designed for.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/beet-on/,Beet-On,Liquor.com,"Normally, when people think of beverages to enjoy with Thanksgiving , their minds go to Beaujolais nouveau, sparkling wine, autumn ales and punch. But sometimes you want a proper cocktail with your turkey dinner, maybe even one that evokes the dishes that make up the table spread. Ruben Hernandez—the head bartender at New York City’s Mediterranean restaurant Miss Ada —was inspired to create a salad stand-in that stems from the Mediterranean tradition of mixing arak with water, mint and citrus over ice. The strikingly colored Beet-On, with arak, beet juice, lemon, sugar and mint, was the result. Arak is often confused with arrack, a spirit made in Indian and Southeast Asia, but the two are distinctly different. Reportedly the oldest flavored spirit in the world, arak is a grape-based liquor flavored with anise seeds and comes from Western Asia. It’s especially popular in Lebanon; the Mediterranean country is a major producer of the spirit, and also one of the few places that has regulations on how it’s labeled. Arak pairs well with a variety of flavors, and in the Beet-On, beets provided the perfect base to it thanks to their earthy sweetness. They also add a gorgeous, intense color, and purple, pink and even rainbow ones work equally well. The richness of the drink is balanced with simple syrup for sweetness and lemon juice for the bright acidity needed to cut through the earthiness of the beets.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cousin-eddie/,Cousin Eddie,Liquor.com,"Eggnog is a seasonal treat that warms up December with its rich blend of liquor, eggs and cream. But there’s more than one way to make Eggnog , as evidenced by the many recipes gracing menus and home bars around the globe. Some choose to make their drinks by separating whites from yolks and beating the eggs with sugar to form peaks. Some make their Eggnog in a blender. And others throw all the ingredients into a shaker with ice. Los Angeles bartender Beau de Bois takes the latter path to make the Cousin Eddie, a fun spin on traditional Eggnog that includes three spirits: Armagnac, aged rum and fernet. For the Armagnac (a type of brandy produced in the Armagnac region in Gascony, France), choose whichever bottle you prefer. But de Bois gets specific with the other boozy ingredients, suggesting Guyana-made El Dorado five-year-old rum and Czech-made R. Jelinek fernet. The rum has notes of tropical fruits, caramel, butterscotch, coconut and vanilla, while the fernet isn’t as bitter or polarizing as the popular Italian amaro Fernet-Branca . Instead, it’s minty, herbal and bittersweet, with notes of anise, clove and raisins. That trio of base spirits provides a complex backbone to the cocktail, which also includes heavy cream, a whole egg, sugar and nutmeg. Shake the ingredients first without ice to emulsify the egg and create a silken texture, then shake again with ice until chilled. Once strained into your glass, you will garnish the drink with black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg to give each sip a spicy, peppery aroma. This is one cousin you’ll want to host all season long. 5 Tips for Making the Best Eggnog RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Armagnac'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'fernet'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'heavy cream'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'whole egg'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'black pepper', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Armagnac, El Dorado rum, fernet, heavy cream, whole egg, sugar and nutmeg into a shaker and vigorously dry-shake (without ice).', 'Fill shaker with ice and shake again until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a double rocks glass over one large ice cube.', 'Garnish with the black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg.']",0,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-sweet-tea/,Bourbon Sweet Tea,Liquor.com,"Sweet tea is the signature caffeinated, sweetened beverage of the American South. It’s impossible to visit a diner without seeing it on the menu, generally in a large container with lemon wedges near and plenty of ice. Then there’s bourbon, whose long and storied history is rooted in the South, too, especially Kentucky and Tennessee, but even states like Texas have their own . It’s unsurprising, then, that bourbon and sweet tea would marry so perfectly. Sweet tea is normally made in batches rather than in individual servings, and this recipe is no different. The process is straightforward, and you can make it a day or two in advance—though it’s important to keep it refrigerated. The main question for this drink is what bourbon to use. Considering it is added to a good amount of black tea and sugar, there’s no need to go crazy with the price point. A bottle that is good and reliable in the $20 to $30 range will serve you best. Higher proof whiskeys—like a bottled in bond expression or even barrel proof—will be more assertive and cut through the other ingredients. Similarly, a high-rye bourbon will present more spice, which contrasts nicely with the sugar and tea, while a wheated bourbon is going to provide further sweetness. This recipe makes around 16 servings of the punch, and with a cup of sugar in it, that means around half an ounce of sugar per glass. It’s not a proper sweet tea unless it requires an immediate dental visit; nevertheless, you can cut down on the sugar a bit, if you like. And if you’re looking for a drink that is similar but a bit different, next try the Sweet Tea Smash from the famed New York City bar PDT.

This smooth-sipping, two-part drink is as easy to make as the name implies, but there’s a reason this classic cocktail has a Snoop Dogg song named after it. It’s fruity and refreshing, and the exact recipe is up to you. So you get to play bartender whenever you mix one up. You don’t need to overthink this one. Grab your favorite fruit juice and whatever gin you have on hand, and you’re set. But if you want to think just a bit, consider which type of gin might pair best with your juice. You can’t go wrong with a juniper-forward London dry gin , which works with nearly any juice you can source, from lemon and lime to orange and grapefruit. Softer gins can work great, too, but depending on their botanical makeup, they may pair better with sweeter OJ or more sour grapefruit. If you’re stuck, try a dry gin with equal parts orange and ruby red grapefruit juice. Or try grapefruit with a dash of lime. Both are refreshing and exactly what you want on a warm day. Some Gin & Juice recipes call for simple syrup . If you like your drinks on the sweeter side, add a half ounce, especially if you’re primarily using grapefruit juice or if you added lemon or lime to your glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/green-margarita/,Green Margarita,Liquor.com,"One of the fun aspects of the ever-expanding world of cocktails is that bartenders are always finding new ingredients, alcoholic or otherwise, to use in their drinks. Often, it means fruits, spices and syrups, but other times it means more vegetal ingredients. Sugar snap peas , for instance, can be pureed into a syrup that pairs well with spirits like tequila, as in the the Green Margarita. This playful take on a Margarita comes from Naren Young—an accomplished bartender and drinks writer—and its color lives up to the name. Like any good Margarita, this one starts with a high quality blanco tequila. For the orange liqueur element, Young opts for Combier. It’s fantastic for a Margarita but can be replaced with Cointreau or Grand Marnier if need be, both of which fill in nicely. And rather than simple syrup or another sweetener, the Green Margarita calls for dry vermouth, which brightens the drink while adding salinity and botanicals. The most notable feature of this Margarita variation, however, is the sugar snap pea puree. Alongside the fresh peas that are blended into it, the puree also gets verjus . Verjus is unsweetened, unfermented juice that is pressed off from unripe grapes, often those used in winemaking. It comes in many varieties and generally has a bright, tart flavor like a mellower vinegar. It, along with a pinch each of salt and sugar, complements the flavors of the sugar snap peas. When making the puree, it’s crucial to use fresh peas. Frozen peas will lead to a muddy, chalky flavor without the necessary sweetness. The end result is a vivid green Margarita with bright vegetal notes and subtle sweetness, perfect for enjoying in a garden or on a patio on a spring evening. 4 Sugar Snap Pea Cocktails to Try Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Combier'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dry vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pea puree'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the blanco tequila, Combier, dry vermouth, pea puree and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",8,tequila

No more Eggnog , for starters, and the warming whiskeys take a backseat to fresh, bright cocktails made with gin, vodka and rum. If you want a drink that evokes spring from its vibrant color to its garden flavors, try the Snap, Chat & Rum. This cocktail features lightly aged rum, lime juice, sugar snap pea and fennel puree, and simple syrup. The puree is the star of the show, contributing the bright-green color and fresh vegetal notes to the drink. Fortunately, it’s easy to make by blending a handful of sugar snap peas with a fennel bulb and water, and then straining out the solids. You’re left with a bright-green liquid that can be employed in this cocktail and others. The Snap, Chat & Rum was originally made with Afrohead Briland 07, a seven-year-old rum from Trinidad with notes of creamy honey and toasted oak. Go ahead and use it if you can find it.

Citrus fruits in particular make regular appearances in classic drinks and original concoctions, as lemons and limes lend brightness and refreshment to fan-favorites like the French 75 and Daiquiri . One ingredient category that doesn’t get enough attention is vegetables, which can be employed in all manner of drinks—not just the Bloody Mary . Proving that point is the Green Giant from celebrated New York bartender Tom Macy. His recipe features sugar snap peas, tarragon, simple syrup, Old Tom gin, dry vermouth and lemon juice in a combination that yields a wave of perfect spring refreshment. Sugar snap peas are in season from late winter through the end of spring. Like snow peas, they are entirely edible, including the pod, so you don’t have to remove the peas before getting to work. Macy adds the whole vegetable into the shaker and muddles it with tarragon and simple syrup to create a quick infusion of bright-green flavor. Rather than using a dry, juniper-forward base spirit like London dry gin, Macy reaches for Old Tom gin , which is usually characterized by a sweeter, maltier flavor profile. Old Tom gins vary in style, and some are even aged, but when making the Green Giant be sure to choose an unaged gin, as you don’t want oaky barrel notes interrupting the drink’s bright, fresh flavors. The dry vermouth brings a floral note to the drink, complementing the gin, sugar snap peas and tarragon, while softening any rough edges. Put it all together, and you get a refreshing dose of springtime flavors that goes down easy and looks great in the glass. Mix the Green Giant during your next spring soiree or any time sugar snap peas are in season.

Miller makes this recipe with Flor de Caña white rum, an affordable and solid white rum from Nicaragua.

In any case, the cinnamon simple syrup adds warmth to balance the cocktail. Once you’ve made it for the Seersucker you can implement the syrup in other drinks, too.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/surfer-on-acid-2/,Surfer on Acid,Liquor.com,"Jägermeister is a German amaro dating back to 1934. It’s produced by steeping 56 herbs and spices, including ginger, anise, citrus peel and juniper, in alcohol and water. That concoction is then aged for one year in oak and sweetened before bottling. The complex liqueur is best known as a party drink (just look at the Jäger Bomb ), but enterprising barkeeps have shown that it also has serious application in cocktails. The Surfer on Acid is one of those cocktails, showcasing how herbal Jäger can work with contrasting ingredients, like tropical coconut rum and pineapple juice. Created by Los Angeles bartender Eric Tecosky in the 1990s, the Surfer on Acid is more than just a catchy name. The versatile drink can be served as a shot, as a cocktail or even straight up. You can adjust the amounts as needed, but since the drink calls for equal parts of each ingredient, it’s very easy to remember. Serving the Surfer on Acid over ice helps to tame the sweet and herbal flavors, and it produces a lengthier, more sessionable cocktail. The Jägermeister provides plenty of oomph, along with a mildly bitter backbone, while the classic duo of coconut rum and pineapple juice lends fruity sweetness. Using fresh pineapple juice—or the best bottled juice you can find—will add brightness and acidity to the drink, helping to keep the flavors balanced.

The cocktail is easy to make and drink and can be ordered after your round or batched in a thermos and stowed for later. Grape juice lends sweetness, a hint of fruit and some much-needed electrolytes to the drink, while the ginger ale adds a pleasant bite and effervescence. This twist by New York bartender Bryan Schneider skips the ginger ale and calls for club soda and homemade ginger syrup. It also employs ice cubes made from Concord grape juice that slowly infuse the drink with grape flavor as they melt. To make the cubes, Schneider fills an ice cube tray with Concord grape juice and places it in the freezer until the cubes are frozen solid. Make your cubes in advance so the ice is fully frozen when you're ready to shake together the remaining ingredients.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/apple-business/,Apple Business,Liquor.com,"Apple cocktails often get a bad rap—largely due to poorly executed Appletinis. But the versatile fruit can be used in a variety of delicious drinks, from warm winter toddies to refreshing summer coolers. The Apple Business, created by Theo Lieberman, a New York-based beverage director and sommelier, is firmly the latter. Lieberman builds the cocktail on a base of Nolet’s gin. The Holland-made spirit is a significant departure from juniper-dominant London dry gins and instead features a floral, fruit-forward profile that counts rose, peach and raspberry among its botanicals. This keeps the flavors light and fresh, but at a stout 47.6% ABV, the gin packs a punch. Add lime juice and honey, and the Apple Business skirts into Bee’s Knees territory (gin, lemon, honey), but an ounce of apple juice takes the flavor in a new direction. The key is to use quality juice. Nothing beats a freshly juiced apple if you have the equipment; otherwise, acquire a bottle of locally pressed juice or the best store-bought option you can find. Apples are naturally sweet, and the juice is paired with honey, so you don’t need a juice with a lot of added sugar. Shake your ingredients together with ice, and you get a refreshing, delicious cocktail that’s perfect for summer or early fall when the days are still warm.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-tender-knob/,Tender Knob,Liquor.com,"There’s something inherently autumnal about bourbon. Drinking it evokes visions of leaves changing color, days shortening, harvest festivals and cool winds. It also conjures the sights and smells of apple orchards and apple picking. And more than being evocative of the fall fruit, bourbon pairs well with apple in drinks, as it does in the Tender Knob. The Tender Knob comes from bartending icon H. Joseph Ehrmann. Ehrmann is the owner of Elixir , one of the oldest continually operating taverns in San Francisco. It’s that very city that helps give the Tender Knob its playful name—one area in town is named the Tendernob, a portmanteau to signify where the Tenderloin and Nob Hill neighborhoods intersect. The Tender Knob name is also a play on Knob Creek, the bourbon used in this lively cocktail. A lauded Kentucky bourbon, Knob Creek is a commendable whiskey both for using in high-end cocktails or for drinking straight, either neat or with a bit of ice to help mellow its intensity. For the apple part of this autumnal drink, Ehrmann muddles apples directly into the shaker and uses a hard apple cider, which transforms the drink into a spritzy highball. These days, cideries are becoming nearly as ubiquitous as breweries. Though there are the big-name cider brands readily available in most markets, plenty of smaller producers are creating special ciders. A pure, unadulterated apple cider is the right pick for this drink. As for the apples themselves, the recipe calls for Granny Smith or Fuji.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sacred-grape/,Sacred Grape,Liquor.com,"Despite its particular profile—that bittersweet juniper flavor that can be so divisive—gin is a remarkably versatile spirit. Beyond its place in bracing, spirit-forward drinks like the Martini or Negroni , it’s also a liquor that pairs well with fruits and herbs. Bartender Mike Di Tota, manager for New York Restaurant group the Smith Restaurant at its Midtown location, plays with this blend of fruit, herbs and gin with the Sacred Grape, a spritzy gin sour that sees Concord grapes and Thai basil bring out the botanical notes of the British spirit. Distinct from both wine grapes and most popular varieties of table grapes, Concords are large and dark, and usually used as jelly grapes or juice grapes, though there are some wines made with them. While they’re most often associated with New England, especially Concord, Massachusetts, and the Finger Lakes of New York, they do grow in other parts of the country, including the Pacific Northwest and parts of the Midwest. The Sacred Grape uses the grape’s natural sweetness, opting for a homemade puree rather than using a store-bought juice. While basil is not a rare botanical for using in cocktails, Thai basil is a little more uncommon. These heavily aromatic leaves have an extra level of spice and anise notes, and pair beautifully with gin and grape. Sweet basil can be used as a substitute, but it won’t have the same flavor profile. Either way, making the basil simple syrup is a breeze, as it only involves infusing some sugar water with Thai basil. Topping with club soda turns this sour into a highball, and ups its bright and refreshing characteristics. While it’s a lovely quaffer at any time of year, it’s especially pleasing when enjoyed outdoors in the spring or summer sun on a lawn or porch.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Concord grape puree*'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Thai basil syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda, to top'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Concord grapes'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Thai basil leaves'}]","['Add the gin, grape puree, basil syrup and lime juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass.', 'Top with club soda.', 'Garnish with Concord grapes and basil leaves.']",0,gin

Some swap gin for another spirit, like the Mezcal Negroni , while others tweak the Campari or vermouth, as with the White Negroni . For his Stranger in the Alps cocktail, Nashville bartender Matthew Tocco charts his own path, sticking with the holy trinity of gin, Campari and vermouth but includes two unique additions: an Oregon brandy and an Italian alpine liqueur. Tocco begins by rinsing a glass with Clear Creek Douglas Fir brandy, which adds a hint of verdant flavor and fragrance. The distillery describes its brandy as “a tree in a bottle” and makes it by infusing fresh Douglas fir buds in eau de vie, giving the spirit a kick of green, herbal flavors and aromas. Tocco also calls on Braulio Amaro, which is made from a recipe of more than 20 mountain herbs and botanicals, including gentian, juniper, peppermint, star anise and wormwood. It’s delightfully bitter, with a cooling hit of pine and menthol. While the classic Negroni uses equal parts gin, vermouth and Campari, Tocco dials up the gin, ensuring that it can stand tall alongside the rich vermouth and one-two punch of bitter liqueurs.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/planet-hoth-toddy/,Planet Hoth Toddy,Alex Frane,"Arguably the greatest sequel ever created, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back opens with the now-iconic opening text crawl. In it, it describes Luke Skywalker establishing a secret rebel base on the ice planet known as Hoth. Today, references to the snowy world are practically mainstream, as evidenced by this cocktail from bar veteran and spirits ambassador Juan Coronado. This rum drinks bears a close similarity to the Hemingway Daiquiri , a drink made with rum, lime, grapefruit and maraschino liqueur. In the Planet Hoth Toddy, however, the simple syrup traditionally used in daiquiris is added back in, and while the maraschino liqueur sticks around, the grapefruit juice does not. It also gets the addition of egg white, whose laces of white foam enhance the comparison to the Star Wars ice planet. In it, Coronado uses Bacardi Gran Reserva Maestro de Ron , a high quality but reasonably priced rum from Puerto Rico. Naturally, swapping it out for a darker, more aged rum will affect not only the flavor and sweetness of the drink, but also its color, making for a darker, less “snowy” looking final product. Coronado does not specify which brand of maraschino liqueur to use in the drink. Chances are, your mind goes to the wicker-covered bottles from Luxardo Maraschino Liqueur, easily the most popular and iconic line of maraschino liqueurs. But the famed Italian label has competition these days , from both young and old distilleries. Maraska is likely the second most popular, but other brands including Leopold Bros. from Denver, Colorado, and Gabriel Boudier Maraschino Liqueur from Dijon, France, are excellent alternatives as well. Despite its name, this drink is not a hot one. Rather, it’s an excuse for a pun on “Hoth Toddy.” Those who want to fully commit to the joke could make it into a hot drink, though, as rum, lime, simple syrup and maraschino all work well in a toddy. Just skip shaking it with ice and instead add all the ingredient (save the egg whites) into a heat-proof vessel and top with around 6 ounces of boiling water. Keeping the egg whites in will result in the drink equivalent of rum scrambled eggs; if you make that you are truly approaching the Dark Side of the Force.

Other drinks—probably most drinks—lie in limbo, their origins a mix of rumor, innuendo and shoddy record keeping. Then there are those whose backstories are entirely made up. The Seelbach, a glittering mixture of bourbon, orange liqueur, two kinds of bitters and Champagne, falls into the latter camp. It’s the signature drink of Louisville’s historic Seelbach Hotel and was once thought to be a classic cocktail rediscovered in the ’90s after decades of obscurity. However, years later, the drink’s inventor confessed to having fabricated the vintage backstory. The supposed classic was created by bartender Adam Seger. He claimed to have discovered the recipe on an old menu from the hotel prior to Prohibition, hoping the story would help drum up business for the bar and to make a name for himself. The Story Behind the Seelbach Cocktail? Absolutely Fake. RELATED ARTICLE Regardless of the tall tale, the elegant drink continues to delight locals and travelers who visit the hotel for a taste of history. It’s bright, bubbly and balanced, providing everything you want in a good cocktail. Nothing in the Seelbach is unique: It’s just bourbon, Cointreau , bitters and Champagne.

The Bloody Roman comes from San Francisco chef Chris Cosentino. It’s a fun take on the classic Bloody Mary that goes well with brunch.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/beermosa/,Beermosa,Alex Frane,"The Mimosa —one of the most iconic drinks there is, and an essential part of any brunch experience. Only the Bloody Mary can challenge the mixture of Champagne and orange juice for morning libation dominance. But for some people, the idea of mixing a high quality sparkling wine with orange juice is offensive, no matter how ripe, juicy and freshly squeezed the citrus is. Others simply don’t like the taste, for whatever reason. Luckily, for those who want bubbles and OJ alongside their eggs Benedict or French toast, there is the Beermosa. Like its parent drink, the Beermosa is a simple, straightforward mix of two ingredients. Simply take your favorite beer, mix it with some orange juice, and you have the Beermosa. However, before anyone gets carried away, there are some ground rules. The first is that you want to reach for a nice, crisp lager. A bright, effervescent beer is the closest in flavor and color to a sparkling white wine (while still being dramatically different). An overly hoppy West Coast IPA would likely clash with the orange juice, sour beers are too particular and funky, and stouts and porters are right out. If you insist on using an ale over a lager, try a hefeweizen, witbier or even a hazy IPA, as the natural fruitiness of them will go better with orange juice. But still, lagers are the best choice in this case. The second rule is to use only the freshest, ripest oranges and juice them for the drink in order to get the best result. Organic, fresh squeezed orange juice from the grocery story is the second choice, and still will work very well. If you use orange juice from concentrate you may as well drink the beer on its own. The final rule of the Beermosa is that it’s called a Beermosa. There was a tendency for years to call the drink a Manmosa, and you can still see drinks called that on the occasional menu. But men, women and people who identify all along the gender spectrum or beyond it can equally enjoy a Mimosa or Beermosa, after all.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/yerba-buena/,Yerba Buena,Alex Frane,"It’s hard to beat a Mojito in terms of pure refreshment, especially in the warmer months of the year. A tall, frosty glass of mint, lime, soda and rum, the Cuban classic has been a popular drink for decades. The Yerba Buena, an intoxicating concoction from the late chef and restaurateur Donna Scala, takes the fundamentals of the drink and adds some fresh elements—reposado tequila is substituted for the rum and ginger beer steps in for the club soda, adding a peppery-sweet kick to the drink. There are a few tips to help make sure the Yerba Buena comes out perfectly. First is to exercise some restraint when muddling the mint—over-muddling mint leaves and grinding them into pulp releases chlorophyll, which can give the drink some unwanted bitterness. Furthermore, the resulting leaves come apart as a stringy mess in the drink. Instead, gently press the leaves with a muddler to release their flavorful oils without pulverizing them. Another tip for building the perfect Yerba Buena is to use whole ice cubes. While it can be appealing to fill the glass with crushed ice like a Mai Tai or Mint Julep , a few larger ice cubes leads to slower dilution, which is important for a drink you can take your time with. A Julep, on the other hand, is a bold, rich drink that benefits from the dilution of crushed ice. The choice of ginger beer greatly affects the final product when making a drink like the Yerba Buena. For starters, there’s a crucial distinction between ginger ale, which is a sweetened soda flavored with ginger, and ginger beer, which gets its bubbles and flavor from the natural fermentation of ginger, sugar, yeast and water. If pressed, ginger ale will get the job done, but it lacks the lively spice of ginger beer. These days there are plenty of excellent ginger beer options on the market. Fentimans sees plenty of action in cocktail bars, while Q Ginger Beer brings an extra level of spice to the mix. However, for a truly special drink (and some extra work), you can always try your hand at making your own ginger beer .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-improved-holland-gin-cock-tail/,Improved Holland Gin Cocktail,Liquor.com,"While today most anything a bartender stirs or shakes is referred to as a “cocktail,” in the 19th century the word had a precise meaning. A cocktail, by definition, was composed of a spirit, bitters, sugar and water, the last generally in the form of ice. During this nascent era of mixed drinks the legendary Jerry Thomas —considered by many to be the forefather of modern bartending—was among the first to record recipes and separate them into various categories. One such category was known as the Improved Cocktail, and among those was the Improved Holland Gin Cocktail. These categories were loose, according to bartending historian and writer David Wondrich in his book on Jerry Thomas, “Imbibe!” However, in it Wondrich classifies the Improved Cocktail as including a spirit, simple syrup, maraschino liqueur, bitters and, crucially, absinthe. Though Wondrich’s consolidation of the varied “improved” recipes includes maraschino as a core ingredient, other versions of the recipe call for orange curaçao, instead. The Improved Holland Gin Cocktail uses genever , sometimes referred to as Holland or Dutch gin, as its base. The predecessor to modern gins, genever is made with a distilled malt wine and then distilled again with juniper berries. Generally, it’s a richer, darker spirit than a London dry gin, and less prevalent in modern drinks. Everything You Need to Know About Genever RELATED ARTICLE When making Jerry Thomas’ version of the Improved Holland Gin Cocktail, the most notable brand of genever is Bols . The company has been making the spirit since the 17th century, and today it continues to be an exemplar of the style. The brand produces three distinct styles of genever, including an aged version and a 100%-malt version, but the best one to go with is the original. However, Bols has competition, with many Dutch brands as well as distillers in the United States and other countries crafting their own takes on the historic spirit. Another aspect to the drink is its proportions: Besides the genever, all the ingredients in the cocktail are listed as dashes. Traditionally, a dash is somewhere around 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon, so if you don’t have bottle tops that allow for dashes of things like curaçao or absinthe, you can use measuring spoons. This also means that the quality of the drink relies on the genever used, with the other ingredients playing more of a background role.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Bols genever'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'dry orange curaçao'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'rich simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the genever, absinthe, dry curaçao, simple syrup and Angostura bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",0,
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ginger-rabbit/,Ginger Rabbit,Liquor.com,"Bourbon, America’s favorite whiskey, is beloved for its bold and rich flavors, including vanilla, caramel, cinnamon and other baking spices. With the Ginger Rabbit, those background notes take center stage as Basil Hayden’s bourbon is mixed with a black tea and star anise-infused simple syrup and fresh ginger. These heady aromatics are then balanced with the inclusion of Creme Yvette, a violet- and fruit-based liqueur. The recipe for the Ginger Rabbit comes from bartender Damian Windsor. With a black tea and star anise-infused simple syrup, the drink starts a bit like a boozy take on a spiced and iced chai, especially with the freshly muddled ginger bringing its telltale spice to the drink. After sealing, the syrup lasts for around a month in the fridge, so there should be plenty of opportunity to try it in other drinks—or to just make a plethora of Ginger Rabbits. Windsor uses Basil Hayden’s as his bourbon of choice in the drink. Part of the Jim Beam line of small batch bourbons, the whiskey is renowned for its assertive rye spice and its boldness, despite its lighter body and its relatively low alcohol level of 80-proof. Those who want their drink to be a bit stronger can substitute in another high-rye bourbon like Redemption or Old Grand Dad. While the drink is a spicy-sweet concoction already, a bit of Creme Yvette helps round off some of the harsher, more intense edges. The violet- and berry-based liqueur once disappeared entirely from shelves in the late ’60s, only to be brought back in the mid-2000s by Charles Jacquin et Cie, the company that had produced it decades earlier. There are other labels crafting their own takes on the sapphire-hued violet spirit, including Rothman & Winter’s which was one of the first Creme de Violettes on the American market in the early 2000s. Unlike Creme Yvette, though, it doesn’t have the berry aspect, and has even more floral characteristics.","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'star anise and black tea-infused simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'slice', 'ingredient': 'fresh ginger'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'strip', 'ingredient': 'lemon peel'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': ""Basil Hayden's bourbon""}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Creme Yvette'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}]","['Add the syrup and ginger to a mixing glass.', 'Twist the lemon peel over the glass to express the oils.', 'Drop the peel into the glass and muddle with the syrup and ginger.', 'Add the bourbon, Creme Yvette and bitters with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass filled with fresh ice.']",9,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mind-eraser/,Mind Eraser,Liquor.com,"The Mind Eraser is a fun drink that hails from the decade of so many other fun drinks: the 1980s. Combining vodka, coffee liqueur and sparkling water, it’s essentially a Black Russian with bubbles. And over the decades, it’s become a popular option for bar patrons seeking a boozy cocktail with a caffeinated kick. The Black Russian was created in the late 1940s in Brussels, and since the drink’s inception, it has spawned numerous variations. That includes the White Russian , which adds cream to the combination of vodka and coffee liqueur. Those two base ingredients are topped with a splash of club soda, which adds a vein of effervescence throughout the drink, in the case of the Mind Eraser. And while the Black Russian sees a two-to-one mix of vodka and liqueur, the Mind Eraser is even easier to remember, calling for equal parts of the two liquids. The cocktail can be made directly in the glass rather than shaken with ice. You can build it in any order you please, but many bartenders choose to make the Mind Eraser as a layered drink, in which each ingredient is stacked in the glass. To follow suit, start with the coffee liqueur, then slowly add the vodka followed by the club soda for a dark-to-clear effect from the bottom up. When consumed with a straw, you imbibe the liquids in order, tasting each layer as you down the drink. No, the Mind Eraser won’t delete your intellect and memories, but it’s a potent cocktail. Have one or two, and the cares of the day will disappear. Drink too many too quickly, and you might enter a self-fulfilling prophecy—in which the cocktail lives up to its name.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kirsch-au-cafe/,Kirsch au Café,Alex Frane,"The Espresso Martini . It is a divisive but undeniably delicious concoction, and a drink that has received plenty of derision over its lifetime. But luckily, it’s also experienced a comeback story in recent years, as well as numerous improvements, tweaks and alterations as bartenders play with the formula. The Kirsch au Café, from bartending veteran St. John Frizell, is one such creation. With brandy and two kinds of cherry liqueur, it certainly stretches the definition of an Espresso Martini, but that’s simply following in the tradition of the original, which itself stretches the definition of a Martini . The base of the Kirsch au Café is cognac. The beloved French brandy is a consummate cocktail ingredient, and can range wildly in price points. For a mixed drink with espresso and cherry spirits in it, it’s best to go with something affordable. With cognac, it’s hard to find a poor quality bottle, so whatever best fits your budget will likely work. While the cocktail is called the Kirsch au Café, it actually has equal parts of two cherry spirits. Unsurprisingly, one is kirsch, which is the general term for cherry eau de vie , the clear, un-aged fruit brandies. Normally it comes from Germany and surrounding areas like Austria and Switzerland, though there are versions of it in the United States. For instance, Clear Creek Distillery in Hood River, Oregon, makes a fabulous kirschwasser (another term for kirsch). The Kirsch au Café also receives an equal amount of Cherry Heering. Unlike kirsch, Heering is a specific (and historic) brand of cherry liqueur. With a storied history, it’s still made in Coppenhagen essentially the same way it has been for the last 200 years. The vivid red color gets lost amidst the espresso in the Kirsch au Café, but its sweet and herbal cherry flavors come through, and they add a depth and complexity that would be lacking if the drink only included kirsch. The rest of the drink is pretty much a straightforward Espresso Martini: simple syrup for additional sweetness and espresso for that silky sweet burst of caffeine. Unlike most versions, however, it also has an egg white to double down on the silkiness and to provide a thick, foamy head. After a few of these, you may never go back to the traditional Espresso Martini again.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/idle-hands/,Idle Hands,Kat Odell,"Chicago's Three Dots and a Dash has become one of the standard bearers of the modern Tiki movement—innovative and forward-thinking yet somehow, like all the best bars, still classic at heart. And though Three Dots has made waves for its frivolously garnished drinks served in kitschy vessels, such as shells, skulls and hollowed-out pineapples, beverage director Kevin Beary is testing a totally new Tiki tune. “What inspires me more than specific cocktails is the concept of applying alternative techniques,” says Beary. Case in point: his cocktail Idle Hands, a clarified Banana Daiquiri that, when served over a large rock in an ungarnished double Old Fashioned glass, looks more like a tame glass of water. Using a clarification technique pioneered by New York culinary whiz Dave Arnold, Beary creates a clear banana rum and a banana syrup by adding an enzyme called Pectinex. The enzyme helps break down the fruit’s pectin, which is a naturally occurring starch. When each solution is run through a centrifuge, the banana solids compress at the bottom of the device, leaving a crystal-clear liquid on top. For citrus, Beary mixes citric, malic, and succinic acids together to replace traditional lime juice. “Not only does it taste like lime juice, it emulates the sensation on the palate of the acidity level of lime juices,” he says. “This allows the cocktail to remain completely clear while retaining the flavor of lime.” Beary then stirs all the components together using the proportions of a traditional Daiquiri before serving the transparent concoction over ice, sans garnish. “We named it Idle Hands for the obnoxious amount of time and care it takes to produce,” says Beary.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'banana rum'}, {'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'banana syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime 2.0'}]","['Add all the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a double Old Fashioned glass over a large ice cube.']",0,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hotel-nacional/,Hotel Nacional,Liquor.com,"Cuba has given the world a plethora of classic drinks. They include the Mojito , the Cuba Libre and, of course, the darling of bartenders and beach-goers everywhere, the Daiquiri . Along with the Daiquiri, the country has given us numerous Daiquiri variations , like Hemingway’s favorite version that he would drink at the famous El Floridita. Another classic Daiquiri comes from the Hotel Nacional, just down the street from El Floradita. Named for its place of origin, the Hotel Nacional is a delightful and historical twist on the classic and features a few unusual ingredients. The bartender most commonly attributed with crafting the first Hotel Nacional is Will P. Taylor, who previously worked as the bar manager at the famous Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York before Prohibition closed it down. However, two other bartenders were at the Hotel Nacional in the early 1930s, when the eponymous drink was created: Eddie Woelke and Fred Kaufman. It’s likely that the true answer involves all three in some capacity, but when the recipe was first published in Charles H. Baker Jr.’s “Gentleman’s Companion” in 1939, it was attributed to Taylor. Regardless of who created it, the Hotel Nacional became the signature drink of the hotel, and a veritable classic. Generally, it starts with white rum though aged rum can also be used (keep in mind it won’t be as vividly bright if you use a darker rum). If you live in the United States, real Cuban rum can still be a pain to get your hands on, but Bacardi 8, Flor de Cana, and Cana Brava white rums are all solid alternatives. Then, along with the obligatory lime juice, the drink employs pineapple juice. Using canned pineapple juice is fine, though using fresh squeezed juice will create a brighter, more floral result. The most dramatic change to the base Daiquiri recipe is the addition of apricot liqueur. It fills in for some of the simple syrup for sweetness, and adds a subtle fruitiness that comes through mostly on the finish. It also gives the drink a richness to balance the tartness of the lime and pineapple. 9 Daiquiri Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'white or aged rum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'apricot liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, apricot liqueur, pineapple juice, lime juice and simple syrup into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",29,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/mollymock/,Mollymock,Liquor.com,"When it comes to the somewhat murky world of rum designations, black rum is one of the more contentious labels . Though there is no strict, legal definition (as is the case with much of rum), the category ultimately refers to rums that are often young or un-aged and are given a darker color and appearance of aging by the addition of molasses or caramel. Some of these are also blackstrap rums—the ingredient necessary for the Dark ’n Stormy —but are not necessarily so, as they can be any kind of rum with added coloring. It’s common for black rums to be relegated to novelty uses, like floating at the top of a tiki drink to give it a band of color. But they can also be used well on their own, adding a toasted bitterness and depth to a cocktail. The Mollymock is one such example—created by bartender and rum expert Juan Coronado, this bold concoction balances the black rum with two botanical liqueurs, lime juice and sugar. Coronado’s black-rum-based cocktail is sweet, bitter and herbal, and starts with Bacardí black rum, which is easy to find on most store shelves, is generally affordable and stands up in a mixed drink. With lime juice and simple syrup, it’s basically a Daiquiri variation , but the inclusion of Benedictine —a French herbal liqueur made with a closely guarded secret recipe—and the Italian liqueur Amaro Montenegro give the drink additional depth and complexity. Unlike the Daiquiri, which normally comes with a lime wedge or no garnish, the Mollymock receives a swath of orange peel for garnish.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/persephones-elixir/,Persephone’s Elixir,Liquor.com,"In Greek mythology, Persephone is the daughter of Zeus and Demeter. She became the queen of the underworld for a spell, and some believed that her absence from the surface caused crops to die, while her reappearance in spring caused them to flourish. If you want to honor this goddess with a drink in hand, try the Persephone’s Elixir. It was created by bartending veteran and beverage consultant Eben Freeman, who has worked behind bars and created menus in New York and around the globe. Freeman’s cocktail features tequila, pomegranate liqueur, fresh lemon juice and ginger beer. The cocktail is similar in makeup to the classic El Diablo , which features tequila, creme de cassis (a sweet blackcurrant liqueur), lime and ginger beer. Pomegranate and cassis are not interchangeable, but they each add fruity sweetness with a tart kick, so if you like the El Diablo, you’ll probably enjoy Persephone’s Elixir. When choosing your tequila, be sure to select a blanco. This unaged variety showcases the agave plant and the earth where it’s grown, typically sporting vegetal flavors often accented by citrus or pepper. Aged tequilas like reposados and añejos include oak barrel flavors like vanilla, caramel and baking spices that, while delicious in their own right, can disrupt the balance of this particular drink. The pomegranate arrives via Pama, a unique liqueur made from pomegranate juice, vodka and a touch of tequila. It’s 34-proof, with a sweet-tart taste and a vibrant color that gives everything it touches a ruby hue. Note that ginger beer is different than ginger ale. The former is a centuries-old drink that is brewed with a strong ginger flavor and a spicy kick, while the latter is essentially ginger-flavored soda. Ginger beers vary considerably, however, and run the gamut from sweet and underwhelming to bright and effervescent with a complex spice profile. When in doubt, opt for a bottle made by a highly regarded craft producer. And when using the ginger beer in this recipe, remember that it’s applied as a topper, not shaken with the other ingredients. Typically, you do not want to shake carbonated ingredients, as that can cause your shaker to expand and separate, letting the precious liquid contents escape.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cider-house-rules/,Cider House Rules,Kelly Magyarics,"Billy Grise, the food and beverage director at Coppin’s Restaurant & Bar in Covington, Kentucky, is a big fan of author John Irving, who penned this cocktail’s namesake novel, a coming-of-age story of an orphan who leaves his home to explore the world. With this drink, you can enjoy a seasonal beverage while exploring the world of cider. “My inspiration for the cocktail was to create something that kept the essence of the end of summer while equally welcoming the fall,” says Grise. To make the Cider House Rules, he begins with Buffalo Trace, a 45% ABV bourbon from his home state. Strawberry cider supplies that summer-to-fall seasonality, adding notes of sweet-tart fruit to the drink. Grise suggests a bottle from CiderBoys or Kopparberg if you can find it, though other strawberry ciders can certainly fill in. You can even go another route entirely and substitute a different flavor if you prefer, as this cocktail allows for some experimentation. To cap things off, Grise enlists honey syrup and lemon juice for balance, and he adds a dash of blackstrap bitters to tie the room together with a subtle hint of molasses, cinnamon and sarsaparilla. Follow Grise’s lead, and in a few short minutes, you’ll have a delicious bourbon-spiked cider cocktail in your hand.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cheeky-peach/,Cheeky Peach,Liquor.com,"Summer brings many reasons to celebrate, from warm weather and swimming pools to seasonal produce like fresh peaches. Depending on where you live, these juicy treats are at their peak from May to September, but with the right drink in your hand, you can take advantage of their magic year-round. The Cheeky Peach is a cocktail from bartender Kristen Struckmeyer. All you need is vodka, peach schnapps , pineapple juice and a little mint, and you can party like it’s the middle of July. Even in the dead of winter. Vodka leads the way in this drink, so choose a bottle that you like—nothing too fancy, but nothing pulled from the bottom shelf. In Europe, schnaps (spelled with one “p”) typically refers to unaged fruit brandies that have been fermented and distilled from fresh fruit juices. In the United States, however, schnapps is a sweetened liqueur usually made from neutral grain spirits and then flavored with fruit, mint or other ingredients. The peach schnapps used in popular ’80s-era drinks like the Fuzzy Navel and Sex on the Beach falls under the latter category. Peach schnapps needn’t be relegated to such questionable concoctions. It’s a versatile cocktail ingredient that, when used deftly, can balance flavors and enhance tastes. That’s what you see with the Cheeky Peach. Vodka lays down a sturdy base, while the schnapps is used sparingly—only a half ounce is required to make itself known. The pineapple juice lends additional fruit notes and steers this drink in a tropical direction, while the bright-red Peychaud’s bitters—best known for their use in the classic Sazerac —provide structure, color and flavors of gentian and anise. A small measure of simple syrup ups the sweetness, while club soda imbues the package with a vein of effervescence. Mint appears twice in this drink. Five leaves are thrown directly into the shaker, and then a mint sprig is applied as garnish to the finished cocktail. The end result is fun, refreshing and prone to refill requests. 20 Vodka Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'peach schnapps'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, simple syrup, Peychaud’s bitters and mint leaves to a shaker with cubed ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a double rocks glass over crushed ice.', 'Top with the club soda.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig.']",19,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/albarino-mint-julep/,Albariño Mint Julep,Liquor.com,"It’s hard to find a drink more closely associated with afternoon quaffing in the sunshine than a Mint Julep . An herbaceous mix of spirits, sugar, and mint, the iconic beverage is a consummate drink for early hours, whether it’s while taking in a horse race or just gathering with friends on a lawn or patio. However, the bourbon in it can pack a mean punch, and keep you from enjoying more than one or two without the risk of getting seriously buzzed. Luckily, bartender veteran Alex Day, of the lauded cocktail bar Death & Co in New York City ( amongst other bars ), has an answer to the problem of Julep-driven over-intoxication: He makes a variation with a white wine, albariño. This Spanish and Portugese varietal is bright and crisp, with plenty of fruit notes balanced by generous tart acid. Day originally used Terras Gauda Abadia de San Campio in his take on the Julep, and the wine’s assertive acidity is smoothed by a bar spoon of creme de peche, which stands in for the simple syrup that normally sweetens the drink. If creme de peche isn’t immediately available, Day advises that any good quality peach liqueur can work. Either way, it gives the drink a subtle but desirable hint of stone fruit. Similarly, any nice bottle of albariño will do the trick in the drink, and the wine is generally on the affordable side of things, making it suitable for mixing in drinks. One of the benefits of this take on the summertime classic is the lower proof. Unlike with a drink made from bourbon—especially higher-proof bourbon like ones bottled in bond or barrel proof—having a few of these while relaxing on a porch or garden won’t knock you out. It’s even less alcohol than even a standard glass of wine, with only three ounces of albariño and a spoonful of peach liqueur. While some Mint Julep recipes call for muddling the mint in the glass, this one only requires a large bunch of fresh mint to garnish the drink and lend it the aromatics. Because of this, it’s best to use a short straw and really get your nose into the leaves as you drink it (or just sip straight from the glass).

But, while you may have enjoyed this sweet and creamy classic as a kid, you’ll be happy to learn that the adult version is even better. The Boozy Root Beer Float takes everything you love about the original—namely the ice cream and root beer —and upgrades it with a pour of rum. The result is a perfect antidote to a hot summer day. Fortunately, the recipe couldn’t be easier. Just scoop some vanilla ice cream into a glass, then add a little rum. Pour chilled root beer over the whole thing, stir briefly and enjoy. When choosing your rum, opt for an aged variety, rather than a white rum. Aged rums will feature some barrel-induced accents like caramel, vanilla and spice, which merge seamlessly with the root beer and ice cream. Other spirits, particularly bourbon, also do an admirable job fortifying this cocktail, but when in doubt, rum is the answer. Serve the Boozy Root Beer Float at backyard barbecues, summer parties and other gatherings where ice-cold beverages are in order. Then note the smiles that wash over your friends’ faces with each sip of this nostalgic drink.

Beyond its topical and decorative uses, aloe can also be consumed when prepared properly. And these days, you can find it adding a twist to cocktails. Straight aloe can be bitter and difficult to work with, says Chicago bartender Angela Lovell. But in liqueur form, it shows delicate and round flavors of melon, cucumber and citrus. To make the Annie Oakley cocktail, she uses Chareau. The all-natural California liqueur is distilled with farm-fresh ingredients, including aloe, cucumber, spearmint, lemon peel and muskmelon, and it’s the easiest way to get aloe into your drinks. Lovell pairs the Chareau with dry sake and a hibiscus-thyme shrub, a non-alcoholic ingredient made from vinegar, sugar and fruit or herbs. The sake complements the aloe liqueur with refreshing fruit flavors while keeping the ABV manageable, and the shrub provides tart acidity, herbal notes and the drink’s deep-red color. “While we went for the full herbal, floral explosion with this cocktail, the liqueur shows really beautifully with simple and subtle combinations like a touch of gin or vodka and a dash of interesting bitters, like orange or grapefruit,” says Lovell.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/orange-blossom/,Orange Blossom,Liquor.com,"During the dark days of Prohibition, good drinks weren’t always easy to come by. To mask the taste of bathtub gin and other illicitly made spirits, people often mixed their liquors with juice, fortified wines or whatever they could get their hands on. In the case of the Orange Blossom, gin was mixed with orange juice and sweet vermouth, and the cocktail became a hit during the 1920s and ’30s. Similar to the Bronx Cocktail (gin, dry vermouth, sweet vermouth, orange juice) and far more interesting than the Screwdriver , the Orange Blossom is a solid brunch drink. But don’t let the time of day keep you from shaking one of these whenever the mood strikes. The Orange Blossom recipe appears in the “The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book” by Albert Stevens Crockett, which was published in 1935. According to the author, the cocktail may have been created by a youthful bartender with romantic spring notions, though it’s more likely that it was devised by “some young bridegroom or other who wanted something novel to use at his final stag party.” Either way, we can thank Crockett for documenting the recipe for posterity. The book also mentions a variation of the drink that skips the vermouth entirely, and calls for equal parts gin and juice. While Snoop Dogg isn’t shy about his preference for Gin & Juice , this particular Orange Blossom benefits from the herbal vermouth, which soothes the bracing gin and acidic juice. When making an Orange Blossom for yourself, use fresh juice for the best results, as it brightens the drink. And feel free to experiment with the gin. If you like your gins on the drier side, try something in the London dry category. If you prefer more citrusy gins, try a modern style. But per “The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book,” the classic choice is actually Old Tom gin, a softer and sweeter type of gin that sands down the cocktail’s edges and adds body. Old Tom was prevalent during Prohibition and can still be found today, should you wish to embrace your Prohibition-era sensibilities.

One example is the South Mint 75, which is a cross between two classic cocktails: the South Side (gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, mint) and the French 75 (gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, Champagne). Britton’s cocktail veers from the above classics by featuring a touch of Southeast Asian influence by way of a zippy lemongrass syrup she makes with lemongrass stalks, sugar and water. The ingredients are shaken with ice and strained into a coupe before being topped with brut cava, a dry Spanish sparkling wine made in a similar fashion as Champagne. The bubbles bring festive effervescence and lend additional nuance to the drink’s flavor. “This French 75 variation has depth, and the addition of lemongrass kicks up the refreshing factor,” says Britton.

But these thirst-quenching drinks don’t need to be relegated to summer, says Chicago bartender Carmen Polcyn, who created the Smoky Limeade during her time at the now-closed Bar Toma. The Smoky Limeade is a versatile drink that can be made with or without alcohol. If you’re choosing the boozy route, she suggests using either tequila or mezcal. If tequila’s your pick, use a blanco for its agave-forward flavors and notes of citrus and pepper. Unaged mezcal works best, too, and will lend your drink earthy notes with subtle smoke. Or skip the liquor entirely and enjoy a no-ABV mocktail that you can sip all day long. In addition to the optional spirit, Polcyn’s choose-your-own-adventure drink features smoked citrus juice, which she creates by grilling sugar-coated lemons and limes over an open flame, plus simple syrup and either club soda or tonic water. Use the soda for a drier drink, or enlist the tonic for a little extra sweetness. The Smoky Limeade is a fun take on the picnic favorite that brings more flavor to the party thanks to the charred citrus. Make it whenever the mood strikes, even if it’s in the dead of winter.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smoke-on-the-water/,Smoke on the Water,Liquor.com,"For backyard barbecues and other summer parties, fruity mezcal drinks are a good way to go, as mezcal’s inherent earthiness and smokiness contrasts beautifully with fruit juices. In the Smoke on the Water, Chicago bartender Carlos Perez mixes Banhez Mezcal Artesanal with Cointreau , watermelon juice, hibiscus syrup and lime juice. He also highlights the mezcal’s natural smokiness with an unorthodox ingredient: a flaming rosemary sprig. With an agave spirit base, Cointreau and lime juice, it’s safe to call the Smoke on the Water a Margarita variation. While there’s a whole ounce of watermelon juice in the drink, the fruit is mild enough that it doesn’t overwhelm any of the other flavors. But the hibiscus simple syrup adds a strong earthiness and sweet-tartness. If you make a large batch, you can try the infused syrup in other drinks. It would work nicely taking the place of simple syrup in drinks like a Pisco Sour or Tom Collins , giving them a deep red color and fruity botanicals. Besides the vivid red coloring from the syrup and juices, the drink gets a visual boost from the garnish, a flaming sprig of rosemary that is first soaked in a high-proof alcohol to make it extra flammable. The smoke is mostly a visual treat, as little of it will make it into the drink.

Created around 1880, the combination of whiskey, sweet vermouth and bitters provides ample space for bartenders to play with the ingredients, switching up base spirits and modifiers to give us noteworthy variations, from the Black Manhattan to the Red Hook . This particular riff, the Proven Perfect, comes from Denver bartender Allison Widdicombe. She was inspired to make a Manhattan variation that incorporated oolong tea. But rather than dumping tea into the bourbon-based cocktail, Widdicombe created an oolong tea-infused ruby port. She joined that with cardamom-infused Amere Nouvelle , a liqueur with flavors of bitter orange and gentian. Finally, she added a scant teaspoon of Fernet-Branca , the bitingly bitter amaro made from a secret blend of 27 herbs, roots and spices.

And sometimes you want some booze and artificial energy, together, in a glass. There are multiple ways to accomplish that simple desire, but none is quite as popular as the Vodka Red Bull. This straightforward drink eschews the modern fascination with “craft” and fresh ingredients, and is content to operate from its own silo of party drinks. Particularly favored by the college crowd and club-goers, the Vodka Red Bull is a common call at a variety of different venues, from dive bars and glitzy clubs to chain restaurants.

The original recipe, created by bartender Nick Mautone back in 2007, originally called for Grey Goose , but any of your favorite vodkas will do. The real star of this drink is perhaps the raspberry liqueur ( Chambord , specifically), which many bartenders and drink enthusiasts tend to write off as somewhat old-school given its heavy use behind the bar in decades past. “Chambord is one of the first modifiers we’ve all used as young bartenders,” says Jason Sorbet, beverage director at The Chloe in New Orleans. “[This] French liqueur is unique in that it’s more than just a fruit liquor. It’s raspberry, blackberry, Madagascar vanilla, citrus, honey and a cognac base. In this particular drink, it makes sense because Chambord’s richness is balanced out by the acidity of the lemonade.” French Martini 136 ratings When it comes to the lemonade component of this drink, it’s ideal to use or make a version with fresh lemon, as fresh fruit brings tartness and complexity that pre-packaged lemonade or lemon ingredients tend to lack.

Prized for its bright, complex flavor, the drink is enjoyed all over the country and, increasingly, all over the world. Its popularity has spurred numerous variations, as barkeeps tweak the classic drink by adding fruits and liqueurs or subbing in different base spirits. That’s the case with the Caipiroska. This simple take on the Caipirinha eschews the traditional cachaça in favor of vodka. The former is Brazil’s national spirit. Similar to rum, cahcaça is distilled from the fermented juice of sugar cane and characterized by its funky, grassy flavor. Vodka, on the other hand, sports a lighter, straightforward profile that yields a lighter-tasting cocktail. For the best results, legendary bartender and author Tony Abou-Ganim suggests making the fresh, citrusy Caipiroska with “a clean, neutral vodka with fruity, floral notes—something made from corn, wheat or mixed grain, something gentle.” The Caipiroska isn’t an obscure variation or merely a training-wheels version of the Caipirinha; it has gained traction in Brazil and neighboring South American countries, as more vodka brands enter the market and locals embrace the spirit.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/new-slang/,New Slang,Liquor.com,"A recent movement that has been gaining traction in the service industry world is that of zero-waste bars. For instance, rather than discard the oranges that are normally zested for their oils, a bar team can char the oranges for use in a sherry cobbler, like they do at Scotch Lodge in Portland, Oregon. Similarly, Schuyler Hunton—an award-winning bartender and spirit rep formerly in Boston—was tired of watching the compost pile stack up night after night when he was at Tiger Mama , so he decided to do something about it. This gin-based cocktail is made from lime juice, coconut water (from coconuts the bar typically uses to make Tiki cups) and the oft-discarded syrup from a Luxardo maraschino cherry jar, for a tall drink that’s bright, refreshing and easy on your conscience. Hunton’s use of Bombay Sapphire for his gin of choice in the New Slang makes sense, as he was the winning contestant in the brand’s international contest Most Imaginative Bartender in 2016. A popular gin amongst bartenders, Bombay Sapphire is a bit brighter and less acerbic than its more traditional London dry brethren. For the cherry portion of the drink, Hunton makes a shrub, or drinking vinegar, from the juice leftover in maraschino cherry jars.

But you don’t need to limit your julep drinking to the first Saturday in May. You don’t even need to use bourbon. The cocktail’s hallmark combination of spirit, mint, sugar and crushed ice works beyond whiskey and lends itself to experimentation. Take the Gin on Gin Julep, for example. This chilly and refreshing drink skips bourbon entirely, instead calling for a botanical makeover thanks to the one-two punch of gin and genever . Gin lays down a dry base, while genever—a precursor to gin that dates to 16th century Holland—has malty characteristics that add warm tones to this otherwise fresh and herbal drink. Simple syrup, mint leaves and club soda round out the cocktail. The Gin on Gin Julep begins like most juleps, by muddling mint and simple syrup together in the bottom of the glass. Add the spirits, then top the liquids with as much crushed ice as you can reasonably fit into the vessel. A splash of club soda brings balance to the strong spirits and sweet sugar and provides a hint of effervescence.

This rings true whether you’re a thirsty patron or an industry pro—anyone can experience a lightbulb moment when tasting a great cocktail. That’s what happened to bartender Brian Elder during a trip to NYC bar, Attaboy. He enjoyed a drink with muddled strawberries that inspired him to create a version of his own. The Aquarelle, a refreshing, pastel-colored, easy-sipping cocktail, is the result of that visit. But rather than muddling fresh fruit , Elder wanted to lessen the prep time and reduce spent fruit waste, so he created a strawberry cordial to sweeten the drink. He combines it with French gin, Pineau de Charantes (a fortified wine that combines fresh or fermented grape juice or must with cognac), Salers gentian aperitif and fresh lemon juice. The pineau brings fruity, nutty flavors to the drink, which play well with the herbal gentian aperitif, dry gin and tart lemon juice.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/london-mule/,London Mule,Liquor.com,"The classic Moscow Mule is a simple, refreshing cocktail that combines vodka, ginger beer and fresh lime juice and is traditionally served in an ice-cold copper mug. The drink dates back to Los Angeles during the middle of the 20th century, but found a resurgence in popularity throughout bars in the early 2000s. Now, it’s difficult to find a bar that doesn’t offer the Moscow Mule , either on its menu or as an off-menu call. Of course, like many popular classics, it has spurred endless variations. Barkeeps will switch the base spirit, make their own ginger beer and experiment with fruits, herbs and other ingredients. Case in point: the London Mule. This variation, sometimes called a Foghorn, is typically made with London dry gin , known for its juniper-forward flavor . The herbaceous notes of the gin balance the spicy sweetness of the ginger beer and the tangy zest of citrus. As the name suggests, the London Mule is named after the gin, which has deep cultural ties to England. While this drink is easy to make, high-quality ingredients are key. Choose a classic London dry gin if you like the bracing bite of juniper, or try a more contemporary style if you prefer your gins to lead with citrus or other botanicals. Whichever route you go, complement that gin with good ginger beer and fresh lime juice to create the best-tasting drink. Serve your mule in a copper mug to keep with the drink's iconic look.

Something about the bitter juniper, tart citrus and a touch of sweetness helps drive off the summer heat. This is precisely the reason for the creation of the Junior Buffalo GDE, which stands for both the greatest dog ever and the greatest drink ever. “When it’s hot out—and it’s always hot in Arizona—I want something light, refreshing and sessionable,” says Clayton MacGregor, who created the Junior Buffalo GDE cocktail at Phoenix’s Pig & Pickle . “It’s an homage to my late favorite dog ever, Buffalo the Bulldog, and this drink lives up to his standard of greatness.” It’s elegant, refreshing and easy to love. When making the drink for the bar, MacGregor carbonated orange flower water and orange simple syrup with still water in a soda siphon. While it’s a fairly straightforward procedure, it’s not the most commonplace tool to have on hand unless you’re making a lot of highballs at home. Instead, you can substitute out the still water for any bottled club soda, adding the orange simple syrup and orange blossom water to that. It won’t be as spritzy as carbonating it all together, but it would work well enough in a pinch. MacGregor’s recipe calls for creating a bit more than a cup of orange simple syrup. Most of it goes into the orange blossom soda water, but if you’re skipping that step and just making individual drinks you’ll have some leftover.

One example is the Green Eyes, which features an unconventional vodka infusion. While you may have seen the likes of cucumber, lime and ginger with vodka before, the Green Eyes goes a new direction with sesame oil-washed vodka. In addition to giving the drink a rich, nutty and distinctive flavor, the oil gives the vodka silkiness and salinity, which is enhanced with a dash of salt. It won’t make the drink overtly salty, but will give it a touch of savoriness. That gets balanced with the bright and crisp cucumber ginger syrup, which uses fresh cucumber juice and raw ginger. The Green Eyes ends up being green and garden-fresh but with a subtle nutty silkiness. Making the sesame oil-washed vodka can be intimidating the first time, but it’s a fairly easy process. Add the oil to the vodka, let it sit for a few days, then pop it in the freezer. The fats from the oil will freeze and you can strain it out.

To make the German Vacation, he begins with a split base of Jägermeister and rum. Jäger may be best known as a college shot, or something to pair with Red Bull, but the German liqueur is bittersweet and herbal, with notes of licorice, clove and ginger that lend complexity to cocktails. He pairs that Jäger with a four-year-old Nicaraguan rum, which adds flavors of vanilla, wood and coconut to the drink. Domaine de Canton, a ginger liqueur from France that merges eau de vie and cognac, brings a distinct gingery kick to the party, while also contributing hints of vanilla and honey. Orgeat, the classic almond syrup that’s used heavily in Tiki drinks, provides an earthy sweetness and more texture, while lemon juice provides freshness and balance. Finally, Peychaud’s bitters lend some anise and gentian aromas, while also adding a pop of color to the mound of crushed ice on top of the drink.

It’s yet to be determined whether we’ll still be drinking the 11-word A Lonely Island Lost in the Middle of a Foggy Sea decades into the future, but with a memorable name and tasty blend of ingredients, it could happen. This cocktail comes from Paul McGee of Chicago’s beloved Tiki bar Three Dots and a Dash . It combines three types of rum with pineapple and lime juices, demerara syrup and cold brew coffee. The first rum is an unaged rhum agricole, which is distilled from fresh sugarcane juice, rather than the more common molasses, and sports a grassy, earthy flavor. Blackstrap rum is next. It’s characterized more by its dark color than by any actual regulations. The category often features young distillates that get their inky hue from caramel coloring, not lengthy barrel aging. But those rums can be intensely flavorful and fun to work with, and blackstrap rums are used in cocktails like the Jungle Bird and Corn ’n’ Oil . Lastly, the recipe calls for Old Port Deluxe rum, which is made in Bangalore, India, using 100% local sugarcane. The rums are sweetened with demerara syrup , a type of simple syrup made with demerara sugar, which has a coarse grain and light tan color. With notes of molasses, toffee and coffee, it provides a richer, deeper flavor than traditional simple syrup, so it pairs well with dark spirits and is a staple in many Tiki-style cocktails. Pineapple lends sweet, tropical notes, while fresh lime juice provides citrusy balance. Finally, the cocktail is topped with a small pour of cold brew coffee before it’s garnished with coffee beans and pineapple leaves. A Lonely Island Lost in the Middle of a Foggy Sea may sound somber, but with a trio of rums, bright fruits and coffee, it’s a fun, complex drink to be enjoyed whenever the mood strikes. 5 Really Bizarre Cocktail Names RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Rhum J.M Agricole Blanc'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demerara syrup'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cold brew coffee'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'coffee beans', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rhum agricole, blackstrap rum, Old Port rum, pineapple juice, demerara syrup, lime juice and cold brew coffee to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Tiki mug or other tall glass filled with crushed ice.', 'Garnish with coffee beans and pineapple leaves.']",4,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/fat-like-buddha/,Fat Like Buddha,Liquor.com,"This bold concoction comes from New York City bartender Brian Miller, founder of the lauded Tiki spot the Polynesian . An assertive, spirit-forward drink, the Fat Like Buddha uses aged rum as the rich, dark spirit it is, rather than treating is as a liquor meant to be mixed with with citrus and syrups, like in a Daiquiri , Mai Tai or other beach-friendly drink. Miller uses Flor de Caña 7-Year-Old Grand Reserve Rum as the base in his Fat Like Buddha; this aged rum has bright fruit notes and an understated elegance, and with at relatively low price point, it’s a solid choice for mixing in cocktails. Miller combines it with Dubonnet Rouge, a French, wine-based aperitif similar to sweet vermouth. The Fat Like Buddha also gets a quarter ounce each of Cointreau —a popular orange liqueur—and Benedictine , a deeply botanical herbal liqueur from France. Besides the rum, which you can swap for another aged rum of similar quality and price, the ingredients in the Fat Like Buddha are particular, without much in the way of alternatives. If pressed, you can use something like Lillet Rouge or Byrrh—both aromatized red wines—in place of the Dubonnet Rouge. Cointreau can be swapped for something like Grand Marnier or Combier, though the flavors will be a bit different. Benedictine, on the other hand, is unique, without any good substitutions. Yellow Chartreuse is the closest (and priciest) alternative, and if you do splurge on a bottle, you can also use it in an Alaska cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/salty-dog/,Salty Dog,Liquor.com,"The Salty Dog is a lot friendlier than it sounds. This classic cocktail is a modified Greyhound (gin or vodka with grapefruit juice) that is differentiated by the drink’s salted rim. But that salt gives this drink its own identity. The Greyhound dates to at least 1930, when it appeared in Harry Craddock’s “Savoy Cocktail Book” as a simple cocktail combining gin, grapefruit and ice. Since then, the Greyhound has stayed largely the same, minus the greater public’s predilection for subbing vodka for gin over the years—a phenomenon that also impacted other historically gin-based classics like the Gimlet and Martini. Eventually, the Greyhound received a salted rim and a new moniker to describe its savory cousin. The Salty Dog was likely created in the 1950s, perhaps by a gentleman named George Jessel, as a way to dial down the grapefruit’s tart and bitter notes. Salt isn’t only for seasoning food. It’s also a popular convention for cocktails; when applied to rims or dashed into drinks like the Salty Dog, Margarita and Paloma , it brings the constituent parts together. Choose your ingredients wisely when making a Salty Dog. With only two liquid ingredients, the quality of your preferred spirit and the grapefruit juice is crucial. Use a good gin or vodka, as the base spirit will remain present with each sip. Fresh grapefruit juice yields a better drink full of rich, flavorful citrus, absent the cloying sweetness or artificial notes present in many packaged varieties. 10 Grapefruit Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'salt', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit slice', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Wet the rim of a highball glass and dip it in coarse salt.', 'Fill the glass with ice, then add the gin (or vodka) and grapefruit juice and stir gently to combine.', 'Garnish with a grapefruit slice.']",195,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dante-belpepper/,Dante Belpepper,Liquor.com,"Mezcal , the smoky, minerally agave spirit from Mexico, spent the latter part of the 2010s as the darling of the bartending world. Whether being swapped out for gin in drinks like the Negroni or bringing some smoke to a Margarita , bartenders love substituting it for other spirits almost as much as they love building original drinks with it. The Dante Belpepper came from bartender Julian Cox during his time at the now-shuttered Los Angeles Peruvian-Japanese restaurant Picca. In it, the natural vegetal notes and brightness of mezcal is enhanced with bell pepper puree, cilantro, lemon and agave syrup. For the spirit base, Cox uses El Silencio Mezcal . This mezcal is comparatively new to the American market, having launched around 2013. The Espadin veresion is meant to be used in cocktails like the Dante Belpeppe. It’s a well-priced mezcal that works nicely in drinks as well as on its own. The name ""El Silencio"" comes from a story about its producer Pedro Jernandez, who reportedly samples each batch of mezcal out in the empty silence of the agave fields at night. With wide distribution, this mezcal shouldn’t be difficult to find, but if it is, or if you’re looking to use a different brand, other bartender-friendly mezcals like Banhez , Del Maguey Vida and Mezcal Union are all affordable, quality labels. Of course, the crux of this drink is the addition of bell pepper. Though an unorthodox ingredient in cocktails, its slightly sweet, vegetal, peppery profile marries lovingly with the bright smokiness of the mezcal. When making the puree, it’s essential to use a ripe orange, yellow or red bell pepper. Green is too vegetal and acerbic to work in this particular drink. Cilantro adds some additional nuance and freshness to the drink, but it can be omitted if you or your guests are the sort of people to whom it tastes soapy. For sweetness, agave syrup steps in for simple syrup, which gives the drink more depth and roundness. This vivid orange drink is then garnished with a carrot top to complete the image.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Mezcal'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'bell pepper puree'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'cilantro'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'carrot top'}]","['Add the mezcal, lemon juice, bell pepper puree, agave nectar and cilantro to a shaker and fill with ice.', 'Shake, and strain into a highball glass filled with fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a carrot top sprig']",0,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/captain-ron/,Captain Ron,Liquor.com,"The Captain Ron is a complex combination of Haitian rum and rye whiskey from bartender Bryan Crowder of the Ice Plant Bar in St. Augustine, Florida. In addition to its two base spirits, the cocktail also features fresh lemon juice, falernum and grenadine. Falernum is a low-proof Caribbean liqueur and a staple in tropical drinks. It lends flavors of lime, ginger, almonds and spice, and it provides a unique way to achieve sweetness in cocktails without reaching for simple syrup. Grenadine is employed in much the same way, though it’s worth considering your options before picking up a bottle from the store. Most commercial grenadines are bright red, cloyingly sweet and filled with artificial ingredients. Instead of resorting to a subpar grenadine, you can invest a few minutes of your time into producing a homemade version made with pomegranate juice, pomegranate molasses and sugar. It’s worth the effort, as DIY grenadine lends a tart richness to drinks that can’t be duplicated by anything you’ll find pre-bottled. Put it all together, and you get a cocktail that is spirited but refreshing, with notes of citrus, spice and tart grenadine complementing the rich, oaky rum and bold rye. 11 Rum Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Rhum Barbancourt 5 Star'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'falernum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grenadine'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'ground cinnamon', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Rhum Barbancourt 5 Star, rye whiskey, lemon juice, falernum and grenadine to a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled coupe glass.', 'Garnish with a dusting of cinnamon and a lemon twist.']",8,whiskey

Rather than a traditional red kimchi, he drew inspiration from dongchimi, a “winter season kimchi that’s not too briny but rather light, bittersweet and refreshing.” (The main difference between red and white kimchi is that white kimchi doesn’t have any spice or pepper added; red kimchi gets its color from the addition of red chilies.) To balance the white kimchi’s saltiness and fermented flavor, Kwon turned to an even split of Beefeater London dry gin and sweeter Hayman’s Old Tom, plus blanc vermouth instead of the classic dry vermouth. “The cocktail needed a little more acidity and sharpness, so I decided to infuse the vermouth with cilantro,” says Kwon. At Atoboy, white kimchi juice is a kitchen byproduct. But since most don’t stock white kimchi at home, go for store-bought kimchi. “Each brand will differ in taste, just like how different branded Bloody Mary mixes impart different flavors,” says Kwon.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smashing-pumpkin/,Smashing Pumpkin,Liquor.com,"While pumpkin isn’t the most commonly used ingredient in bartending, there are a number of cocktails that do utilize falls’s most iconic squash . The Smashing Pumpkin, from bartender James Horn, gets its pumpkin infusion with a homemade lemon-pumpkin soda. Combined with rum and allspice liqueur, two consummate autumnal flavors, the unconventional highball is a fall treat that’s enjoyable year-round. While the Smashing Pumpkin is easy enough to put together once you’ve got all of its parts ready, the real work is in making the lemon-pumpkin soda. First off, you’ll need a soda siphon. While these devices can be pricey at times, you’ll appreciate having one on-hand if you’re making a lot of highballs at home , or even if you enjoy having club soda around the house but don’t want to constantly buy—and subsequently throw out—cans and bottles. Any kitchen supply store should have one, or you can turn to online markets if not. Secondly, you’ll need some pumpkin puree—you can easily buy a can at the store, especially during the holiday season, or you can make your own. Roasting your own pumpkin and pureeing some of its flesh is a great way to ensure that there’s enough moisture content to work with the soda siphon. If you’re opting for canned pumpkin, you may need to use extra lemon juice and water in the soda. Either way, be sure to mix the ingredients of the soda before adding them to the siphon to ensure it all comes out evenly. Once you’ve got your lemon-pumpkin soda, the rest of the recipe is straightforward and can easily be made in batches for parties and other gatherings. And, while the Smashing Pumpkin calls for an aged rum, you can always switch it out for your preferred spirit. Brandy and whiskey would work well with the allspice liqueur and pumpkin, while vodka would make for a lighter, brighter highball. 11 Pumpkin Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'allspice liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'lemon-pumpkin soda'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'leaf', 'ingredient': 'bay leaf'}]","['Add the rum and allspice liqueur to a Collins glass filled with ice.', 'Top with the lemon-pumpkin soda.', 'Garnish with a bay leaf.']",4,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/calafia/,Calafia,Liquor.com,"Fresh squeezed juices, especially citrus, are commonplace on cocktail menus, but rarely are they made with fennel. The Calafia comes from San Francisco bartender Anthony Parks during his tenure at Finn Town. In it, fennel juice lends freshness and subtle anise notes to a tequila-forward highball. While unorthodox, it comes together as a layered, intricate and refreshing drink. Parks uses Cimarron blanco tequila as the base of the cocktail, but, as with most tequila drinks like the Margarita or Paloma, you can substitute your favorite brand without altering the flavors too much. Just be sure to use a blanco tequila rather than a darker, aged one. Similarly, you can swap the El Silencio mezcal for another espadin mezcal of your choice (luckily, the majority of mezcals are made with espadin agave). The slight amount of mezcal in the cocktail adds subtle smoke and earthiness without overwhelming the tequila-forward flavor. The fennel juice is the true star of the show, though. If you have a juicer at home it will be a breeze to make. Simply throw a few fennel bulbs into the juicer and be greeted with aromatic, anise-tinged root juice. If you don’t have access to a juicer, then a blender is the way to go. Add a few bulbs to a blender and top with water, then pulse until they reach a fine consistency. Strain the juice through a cheesecloth to separate out the pulp and solids. Though it takes a bit of work to build, the Calafia is a bright and vivid highball with unique botanical notes thanks to the fennel. Plus, you can always use the fennel juice in other drinks, playing around with what works and what doesn’t.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cimarron Blanco Tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'El Silencio espadin mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'fennel juice (juice of fennel bulbs)'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda, to top'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: fennel fronds', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: fennel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the blanco tequila, espadin mezcal, fennel juice, agave syrup and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with club soda.', 'Garnish with fennel fronds and fennel pollen.']",4,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rum-n-ginger/,Rum & Ginger,Kelly Magyarics,"BlackTail—the Lower Manhattan retro Cuban bar from the team behind famed Irish bar the Dead Rabbit—has closed, but its legacy lives on. When it was open, the bar was known to modernize classics like the Rum & Coke and the Daiquiri , and its contemporary riff on the Dark ’n Stormy was simply called the Rum & Ginger. Bartender Nate Dobson took the trifecta of dark rum, ginger beer and lime juice and added passion fruit, bitters and a blend of funky Jamaican spirits. While a Dark ’n Stormy, by trademark law , must be made with Gosling’s Black Seal rum, the Rum & Ginger is free from any such obligation and is made with Dead Rabbit’s unique blend of rums. Mixing rum bases is a popular move for drinks like the Mai Tai , and this particular blend consists of four different labels. While most of them should be easy to find, the Bacardi Superior Heritage Limited Edition likely won’t be; substituting another expression of Bacardi works. Since you’ll likely be making more than two ounces of the blend, you can try it in any other white rum drink, like a Daiquiri, Mojito or Mai Tai. Rum Blends Belong in Your Mai Tais. Here's Why. RELATED ARTICLE The four rums that go into the DR blend aren’t the only ones in the Rum & Ginger—it also gets a quarter ounce of Wray & Nephew overproof. This rich, clear rum adds a significant punch at 126 proof, as well as a bit of that Jamaican rum “funk,” also known as hogo. For the fruit aspect, the Rum & Ginger gets a teaspoon of passionfruit puree, which adds a subtle fruitiness and tartness that enhances the lime juice. The drink is then topped with Blenheim ginger ale, rather than the traditional ginger beer seen in the Dark ’n Stormy. Unlike most ginger ale, Blenheim has a decent level of spice, so if substituting make sure to avoid using a generic ginger ale brand. Try using a ginger beer, instead. 5 Recipe Variations Every Dark ’n Stormy Lover Should Know FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'DR rum blend'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Wray & Nephew overproof\xa0rum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'passion fruit puree'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Blenheim ginger ale'}]","['Add the rum blend, overproof rum, lime juice, passion fruit puree and bitters into a Collins glass filled with ice.', 'Top with the ginger ale.']",6,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/spicy-negroni/,Spicy Negroni,Céline Bossart,"In this twist on the classic by Erin Cusick, a bartender at Clover Club in New York City, a bit of mezcal, chile liqueur and spicy bitters combine forces to give the Negroni a smoky and piquant finish. “The most common misconception around spicy cocktails is that they’re just heat and no nuance or flavor—but when you tap into spice with actual flavor by using the right ingredients, you can create a nice, savory drink with some serious heat,” says Cusick. Combining different spicy ingredients—such as Ancho Reyes red chile liqueur and Bittermens’ Hellfire Habanero Shrub bitters, in this case—can help to reach those levels of complex spice that Cusick recommends. If that’s still not sufficient for the heat seekers, Cusick offers another method to raise your drink’s position on the Scoville scale. “For some extra kick, you could infuse your mezcal or any other base spirit with your own custom pepper combination,” Cusick adds. “This could be as simple as throwing some sliced jalapenos into a container of spirit, or a curated mélange of hot peppers, depending on the flavors and level of heat you’re hoping to achieve. Either way, check on the mixture after one hour, and then taste every hour after that until you deem it ready. If you want extremely spicy, you can leave the infusion overnight and see what it tastes like the next day.” With your newfound spice skills, there’s a whole world of possibility ahead.

But while it wouldn’t be misguided to do so, the syrup, instead of triple sec, makes this drink more akin to a variation on a Tequila Sour. Whatever the case, the Rodriguez Sour is a sweet and sour cocktail with a fiery kick of jalapeño. The drink comes from bartending veteran Kevin Diedrich, from San Francisco bar Pacific Cocktail Haven. Besides the spice from the jalapeño syrup and the sweet tart flavors of pineapple, the drink features additional complexity and a pale green hue from the inclusion of green Chartreuse .

Secret recipe aside, the liqueur pairs beautifully with a number of spirits, lending its aromatic botanicals to drinks like the Last Word and the Tipperary . Tequila, in general, pairs well with the liqueur, accentuating its vegetal, grassy notes. The jalapeño simple syrup is what brings the heat to the party.

https://www.liquor.com/absinthe-suisse-cocktail-recipe-5075636,Absinthe Suisse,Liquor.com,"Absinthe has a romantic and nearly mythological reputation. Over the years, the “Green Fairy” has been favored by writers and artists, from Hemingway to Van Gogh. But it’s also suffered a nefarious reputation, as absinthe was said to inspire dangerous hallucinations. We now know that myth is false, or at least associated with overconsumption of the high-proof spirit rather than its ingredients. Despite or perhaps because of its notoriety, absinthe has remained a fascination for many drinkers. Some are introduced to it through the Sazerac , in which it is used sparingly. Others have enjoyed an Absinthe Drip that features the spirit in full force, simply diluted with cold water. Absinthe is nothing if not versatile. “To me, absinthe is meant to fill one of two roles,” says New York bartender Wilmer Nolasco. “It’s either a base spirit or a supporting ingredient meant to highlight other flavors in drinks.” A full ounce goes into the Absinthe Suisse, his linguistically neutral-gendered take on the Absinthe Suissesse , a New Orleans brunch cocktail that assumes a more feminine form in both name (in French) and delicate flavor. “Absinthe’s best attributes are that it’s nuanced but very upfront about what it is,” says Nolasco. “Too often, I see people overuse the ingredient in terms of proportion.” The Absinthe Suisse features absinthe, creme de menthe, tequila, pastis, heavy cream, orgeat, lemon juice, rose flower water, egg white and a mint sprig. The tequila and lemon juice are unique to this version and not found in the Absinthe Suissesse. The cocktail is herbal and creamy, balanced by sweetness and citrus, and a fine example of what absinthe can do in drinks. What the #$@! Do I Do with This? Absinthe: What It Is and How to Use It.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rich-table/,Rich Table,Emily Cappiello,"This cocktail by Morgan Schick, former creative director of San Francisco’s Bon Vivants and Trick Dog , has a few tricks up its sleeve. For starters, there’s the Douglas fir-infused vodka, which can either be bought at a specialty liquor retailer or made ahead of time, and then you’ve got the homemade red shiso-avocado simple syrup for additional layers of flavor and complexity. This is not a cocktail for the faint of heart or palate—with a hint of heat, a bright pop of citrus, and a finishing touch in the form of infused sea salt, the Rich Table and its unique drinking experience make it worth all the effort. While often thought of as a small detail, salt’s presence in a cocktail can make a serious impact on flavor profile. A small pinch can not only brighten fruit notes in a shaken drink, but can also act as somewhat of a unifying agent, tying together a cocktail’s other ingredients in a nice, tidy bow. The use of salt on the rim of a glass can do the same, but in more of a choose-your-own-adventure format—you can opt in or out of including it in any given sip, and once you start playing around with infused or flavored salts, the added aroma and flavor factors can really take things to the next level. In the Rich Table’s case, pinot noir-infused premium sea salt brings a savory quality into the mix along with peripheral notes of vanilla and ripe red fruits, as well as an overall vinous quality, subtle as it may be. A relatively small amount of salt is needed for this cocktail’s rim, leaving plenty left over for additional rounds and for use in the kitchen.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/amanyara-mojito/,Amanyara Mojito,Liquor.com,"Ask bartenders what's the most annoying thing about making a Mojito , and they’ll most likely point to all that muddling. And when those same bartenders get overzealous with the muddler , guests have to suffer through pesky flecks of mint getting stuck in between their teeth. First-world problems? Most definitely. Are these still nuisances on both sides of the bar? For sure. But one resort figured out how to eliminate these cocktail conundrums. Order a Mojito at the Amanyara resort on the Turks & Caicos island of Providenciales, and what arrives at your table looks like none you’ve ever seen before. The secret? Blend the rum, mint, lime juice and simple syrup instead of muddling and shaking them, then class it up by topping the drink with brut Champagne instead of club soda. “The idea of blending the ingredients was to make the Mojito look more inviting due to its fresh green color and to ensure the mint is blended properly throughout the entire drink,” says Edward Linsley, the former general manager of the Aman resorts. “The mixture is poured through a fine strainer to prevent smaller pieces of mint from remaining in the drink, as mint oxidizes and can turn the drink brown.” Oxidation is precisely the problem with shortcuts like infusing the mint into a syrup or muddling a bunch of drinks in advance and just topping them off with ice and club soda.

Rum, tequila and even brandy can all be combined with tonic for a quick infusion of effervescence and flavor. Elana Abt, a wine director and sommelier, created the Summer Tonic while working at the now-closed Otto in New York. She wanted to add a rum-based cocktail to the menu but keep the refreshing Gin & Tonic in mind. “Rum just feels like summer, and my guests typically order more rum cocktails this time of year,” she says. “I thought, ‘Why not create a cool rum version of the classic G&T.’” And that’s exactly what she did, beginning with richly flavored Mount Gay rum from Barbados. She paired that with Borgia Bitter Rosso, a bright-red aperitif flavored with gentian flower and gentian root. This unique liqueur acts like Campari and other bitter red liqueurs when mixed into drinks, so if you can’t find Borgia, you can try a substitute for similar results. Fresh lemon juice adds bright citrusy balance, and Fever-Tree aromatic tonic water brings a vivid little extra to the cocktail.

The Daiquiri No. 6, from Cane & Table in New Orleans, takes the classic recipe and adds a touch of the Hemingway Daiquiri in the form of grapefruit, but does so in an unconventional way. Rather than freshly squeezed juice, the drink is blended with a whole grapefruit, peeled and seeded. And, instead of a splash of maraschino liqueur, the No. 6 includes granulated sugar and a portion of dark creme de cacao. The result is frothy, juicy, and a touch chocolatey, a blended Daiquiri with some kick.

If you don’t have this on hand or if you prefer another rum, be sure to use one with a comparable age statement. A blend of different aged rums can also work well in any Daiquiri, including the No. 6. Normally, salted rims on blended drinks are saved for Margaritas , not Daiquiris. However, this chocolatey, citrusy blended Daiquiri gets additional nuance in the form of a smoked salt rim. As with any salt (or sugar) rim, it’s advisable to cover only half the rim of the glass so that whoever is drinking it can choose whether or not to include a taste with each sip. 9 Daiquiri Twists to Try Right Now FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Bacardi Reserva Ocho rum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'dark creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'whole grapefruit, pitted and peeled'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'granulated sugar'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: smoked salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Prepare an Old Fashioned glass with a rim of smoked salt.', 'Add the Bacardí Ocho rum, dark creme de cacao, whole grapefruit, lime juice, and granulated sugar into a blender with 1 cup of cracked ice and blend until smooth.', 'Pour into the prepared Old Fashioned glass.']",0,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/bourbon-and-berries/,Bourbon & Berries,Liquor.com,"Outside of drinks like the Mint Julep , bourbon is considered to be more of an autumnal and wintery spirit, meant for sipping in front of fire places or in warm bars. Unlike tequila or rum, it’s not generally considered a summer sipper. But when combined with the right ingredients, bourbon can easily become an all-season, year-long spirit. One such ingredient that can be used to bring it into the warmer months is strawberries, those quintessential summer treats. Originally created by former bar lead Willem Van Leuven at San Diego’s Herb & Wood and adapted by bar lead Emily Carroll, this take on the Old Fashioned employs a different flavored syrup depending on the seasonal produce that’s available. “The strawberry-vanilla syrup that we use to add dimension to this cocktail was the result of a collaborative effort with our executive pastry chef, Adrian Mendoza, who’s the brains behind the berry syrup series and to date has developed a cranberry-cinnamon and blackberry-cinnamon, in addition to the strawberry,” says Carroll. One of the best elements of the Bourbon & Berries recipe is its flexibility. For one, you can use the strawberry-vanilla syrup in other recipes. For instance, try substituting it for the simple syrup in a Daiquiri or for the sweetener in a Margarita to add a fruity touch. Additionally, you can adjust the recipe for different fruits—like other berries in summer, or fall fruits like apple or pear, both of which marry with vanilla lovingly. Similarly, even the base spirit can be altered. While the purpose is to drink bourbon year-round, there’s nothing stopping you from using another spirit in its stead. Rum, for instance, would make a lovely Old Fashioned with the strawberry-vanilla syrup. Or, you could use a rye whiskey instead of a bourbon, for extra spice that pairs well with the vanilla. The point is to have fun with a fruit syrup and an Old Fashioned base.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'strawberry-vanilla syrup'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, strawberry-vanilla syrup and Angostura bitters to a double rocks glass filled with 1 large ice cube and stir for 18 to 20 seconds, then add a few more ice cubes.', 'Express the oil of an orange peel, then drop the peel in the glass.']",32,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/limoncello/,Limoncello,Amanda Marsteller,"Opening a bottle of limoncello has a transporting effect. Like stepping into a sun-drenched citrus grove, the clouds part and the golden liquid is a temporary reminder that sunshine can indeed survive indoors. Many like to take credit for creating limoncello. The intensely flavored liqueur is produced with equal passion in multiple areas of Italy, including in Sorrento, along the Amalfi coast and on the island of Capri. Limoncello is a staple digestivo after dinner in parts of Italy, and most restaurants hawk their own brand. Family recipes also differ greatly, with some leaning sweet while others embrace the drink’s tangy, acidic potential. When making your own limoncello, the balance of flavors is up to your palate—and the recipe couldn’t be simpler: Peel, soak, sweeten and chill. And soon you’ll want to play with other flavors. The same imagination can be applied to any citrus fruit from limes to grapefruit to vanilla and orange . It’s time to get squeezing. A few tips for preparing limoncello: Select organic thick-skinned lemons that don’t have wax and pesticides on the peel. If you can’t find organic fruit, wash and scrub lemons with hot water before peeling. Use high-proof alcohol like 100-proof vodka or even Everclear. Higher proof means a better infusion. Avoid peeling the bitter white pith of the citrus, use only the peel itself. Store the in-process infusion in a cool, dark place. Start with one cup of sweetener, then taste before adding more. Now, how to drink it? Traditionally, straight from the freezer. Limoncello benefits from a strong, frosty chill. Drink it as an after-dinner palate cleanser or marry it with gin and fresh thyme. It’s also an easy shortcut to a fabulous Lemon Drop . Limoncello never resists a dance with bubbles and can even be served drizzled over fruit and ice cream. Shine on, you Italian stud.","[{'quantity': '10', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemons'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'bottle', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}]","['Use a vegetable peeler or zester to remove the peels from all of the lemons, avoiding removing the bitter white pith.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/greyhound/,Greyhound,Liquor.com,"The Greyhound is a two-part classic cocktail composed of gin or vodka and grapefruit juice. It's simple, tart and refreshing—perfect for when you're looking for something easy to sip, or as a classic brunch option . The Greyhound’s first known mention arrived thanks to bartender and author Harry Craddock’s Savoy Cocktail Book , a classic tome that was published in 1930. In his book, Craddock instructed readers to make the no-frills Greyhound with gin, grapefruit and ice. Once vodka appeared in the United States and started to gain traction circa 1950, the spirit increasingly began to replace gin in the cocktail. The Greyhound bus terminal’s ubiquitous restaurant chain, Post House, served their version with vodka. And since the restaurants were frequented by travelers all over the country, the vodka-spiked drink propagated widely. Why the Greyhound Works Today, it’s common to see both spirits employed in the Greyhound, so try both gin and vodka and see which you prefer. But be sure to choose a high-quality base spirit no matter which of the two spirits you select. With only two ingredients, there’s nowhere for a suboptimal vodka or gin to hide. The same goes for the juice. Over the decades, many bars have used canned or pre-bottled grapefruit juice in their Greyhounds. This is an option, of course, but fresh juice gives the drink a more refreshing, complex kick. Similar to how a Screwdriver just tastes better with fresh OJ, using fresh grapefruit in the Greyhound results in a cocktail that is perfect for breakfast, brunch and midday pick-me-ups. Fortunately, one grapefruit yields a lot of juice, so you often only need one to make the cocktail. For an easy upgrade, rub the glass’ rim with some of the spent grapefruit, then dip the rim into a shallow saucer loaded with salt. The result is another canine-related classic, the Salty Dog . This simple variation can also be made with either gin or vodka, and the salted rim lends a savory quality to each electrolyte-laced sip. 10 Grapefruit Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a rocks glass with ice, then add the vodka or gin and the grapefruit juice and stir gently.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",143,vodka

The simple combination is light, safe and easy to drink, a perfect choice for anyone who wants a little kick without the added sugar or intense flavors present in many other cocktails. The Vodka Soda is often ordered by people looking for a healthier option when they drink, and there’s certainly no shame in that. But since vodka has the same amount of calories as any other spirit of the same potency (and water is water), it’s no healthier than a Tequila Soda or a Scotch & Soda . And yet, the Vodka Soda remains one of the most commonly ordered drinks across the country, from dive bars to nightclubs. When making such a simple drink, there’s nowhere for the ingredients to hide, so it’s important to choose a quality vodka and good water. No, not all vodka tastes the same . Bottles vary by raw ingredient, terroir and distillation methods. So when choosing a bottle, pick one you’d be happy to sip on its own, and unless you’re at the mercy of a bar’s soda gun, apply the same strategy when choosing your water.

These classics are balanced and flavorful, and they contain enough booze to let you know you’ve accomplished something. But should you desire an impressive drink without as much alcohol, there’s the Reverse Manhattan . This cocktail flips the typical Manhattan ratio on its head, making vermouth the star and giving whiskey a supporting role. It’s typically made with two parts vermouth to one part whiskey, but you have options. And, naturally, creative bartenders keep finding ways to customize the drink. The Downhill Daring is a Reverse Manhattan variation that was inspired by the Brooklyn cocktail (rye whiskey, dry vermouth, maraschino liqueur and Amer Picon) and Philip Greene’s book, “ A Drinkable Feast ,” which details libations from 1920s Paris. Brian Nixon, the general manager of Truxton Inn and McClellan’s Retreat in Washington, D.C., puts the bitter Italian vermouth Punt e Mes front and center and also enlists the charms of Cocchi Americano, a wine-based aperitif. Bourbon provides structure and a boozy kick, Benedictine adds herbal sweetness and two different bitters lend spicy aromatics and zesty citrus. The cocktail has a lot going for it. Punt e Mes brings roasty chocolate notes that pair deftly with Benedictine’s herbaceousness and the floral Cocchi Americano.

Composed of bourbon, sugar, mint and crushed ice, this refreshing cocktail was liquid air-conditioning served in a silver cup. Although the bourbon-spiked Mint Julep is the most well-known version on the cocktail, the julep is actually a category of drinks featuring a spirit served over crushed ice. So, it comes in more varieties than only bourbon and mint, and some of the first juleps were made with cognac and brandy. Very few were made with Thin Mint cookies, however. The Thin Mint Julep is a modern invention from bartender Kristen Struckmeyer that’s perfect for anyone who wants to pair their Girl Scout cookies with whiskey.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/harvest-moon/,Harvest Moon,Liquor.com,"Inspired by the harvest season in late September, New York City bartender Shawn Chen developed this whiskey-based drink while working as the beverage director at RedFarm and principal bartender at Decoy . The Harvest Moon avoids the usual trappings of autumnal drinks—flavors like apple, cinnamon, pumpkin and pear—and instead mixes cherry, Concord grape, and Fernet-Branca with American whiskey. For the base of his cocktail, Chen uses Tincup Whiskey , a distillery in Colorado. The distillery’s flagship whiskey is a blend of high-rye bourbon and American single malt, for a unique and layered product. To it, Chen adds the classic Italian digestif Fernet-Branca , which gives the cocktail depth, bitterness and botanicals. Cherry Heering, a bittersweet cherry liqueur, adds a touch of additional sweetness, and madeira—a fortified wine from the Portuguese islands of the same name—gives nuttiness as well as caramel and toffee notes. Because of the specificity of flavor in each ingredient, none of them can be easily substituted. However their relatively low volume in the drink, only a quarter-ounce each, means you could use something similar if really pressed, like another cherry liqueur for the Heering and sherry or dry port for the madeira. What really sets the Harvest Moon apart is the use of Concord grape shrub. Primarily used in jams and jellies, Concord grapes are found throughout New England and the midwest. Large, dark and sweet, they hold up well as the base of a shrub.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/dracarys/,Dracarys,Liquor.com,"The Dark ’n Stormy is a beloved classic cocktail. Is sweet and refreshing characteristics boast a backdrop of subtle heat, especially when using a particularly peppery ginger beer like Goyan Jamaican Style Ginger beer. If, though, you want your Dark ’n Stormy to have even more heat, than the appropriately named Dracarys is a good place to start. The drink is named for the command word that Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, uses to direct her winged, scaly “children” to unleash their fire breath in the seminal HBO program “Game of Thrones.” This spicy riff on a Dark ’n Stormy kind of replicates that fire breathing when imbibed, says Jenn Harvey, the bar manager at Temple Bar in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “While too much spice tends to kill people’s palates, this cocktail has an initial gentle heat that builds as you drink it, ultimately leading one to breath fire.” Dracarys gets most of its spicy kick from an ancho chile-infused bourbon. Unlike some infusions, this one is pretty simple, easy enough to do at home with just a liter bottle of bourbon or a liter jar. Ancho chiles offer a modest but assertive level of heat, one that can be enhanced by using a high-rye bourbon, which has a spicier profile than most other bourbons. Because of the intensity of the infusion, you may want to save the top-shelf bourbons for a different drink, but that doesn’t mean you can go too cheap without it coming through. A good workhorse bourbon around the $20 to $25 range is generally going to work well. And, of course, those wanting to really mimic the draconic conflagration could substitute an ever hotter pepper, but that could potentially overwhelm all the other aspects of the drink. Amaro Montenegro adds some sweetness, bitterness and herbal notes to the Dracarys. A well-regarded amaro, it’s made with a blend of 40 botanicals from four different continents, and while it mixes beautifully in drinks, it’s also lovely on its own as an after-dinner libation. Harvey uses Llanllyr Source Fiery for the ginger beer portion of the highball.

Her Forefathers cocktail is a sweet tea-laced rendition of an Old Fashioned that appropriately fits into Bar Cleeta’s cocktail collection: simple, classic-inspired libations made from just a few seasonal ingredients. The cocktail is firmly in line with the restaurant’s New American-meets-Southern-inflected menu, where you’re likely to find charred chile-spiked market beans with caramelized sour cream and hazelnut gremolata or an onion-and-bacon tarte flambé. “We thought we should bring a little bit of the metropolitan-style dining to the area,” says Weisi Basore, adding that despite a bit of polish, her husband’s food is still “incredibly homey and rustic.” Basore helped the late Sasha Petraske open now-defunct White Star bar on New York City’s Lower East Side more than a decade ago and credits the cocktail pioneer with her training. From there, she eventually moved on to Manhattan’s lauded seasonal New American restaurant Blue Hill . Meanwhile, also in New York, her husband moved over from executive sous chef at Colicchio & Sons to executive chef at popular wine bar Pearl & Ash (both now closed). The couple spent a year or so in Los Angeles before committing to Trae’s hometown in Arkansas. The Forefathers is liquid tribute to the South––one that incorporates the region’s most beloved summer refreshment and its prime summer fruit, peaches. To build the drink, she first makes a sweet tea oleo saccharum by macerating citrus with sugar, then cooks the mixture with sweet tea to form a syrup.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/stone-cold-larceny/,Stone Cold Larceny,Liquor.com,"Alongside ubiquitous highballs like the Gin & Tonic and the Vodka Soda , the Ginger Ale Highball is an essential drink that is also simple, easy to craft and always pleasing. There’s something about the mix of warming whiskey, spicy-sweet ginger and bubbly soda that, when garnished with a lemon or lime wedge for a bit of added tartness, really hits the spot. The Stone Cold Larceny comes from bartender Ted Kilgore who, as the founder of Planter’s House , a cocktail bar in St. Louis, Missouri, helped bring national attention to the city’s cocktail scene. In this recipe the Ginger HighBall gets some extra autumnal qualities with the addition of apple juice. Given that the drink is a simple one with only three ingredients, each aspect’s quality greatly impacts the final product. Because of this, using a high-quality, fresh-squeezed apple juice from, say, a local farmer’s market or speciality grocery store is going to produce a superior highball than if using a from-concentrate brand of store-bought apple juice. Similarly, the choice of whiskey is important to the Stone Cold Larceny, but that is more about personal preference. Kilgore uses Larceny bourbon , which lends the drink its name. The Kentucky straight bourbon is relatively new, being first released in 2012 by Heaven Hill Distillery. Like its fellow whiskey, Old Fitzgerald, Larceny is a wheated bourbon, which gives it sweeter notes than a bourbon made with, say, a heavy rye or malt profile. While the Kentucky straight bourbon is the go-to for this drink, there is the option to use one of Larceny’s barrel-proof bourbons. The strength of the whiskey will cut right through the apple and ginger spices, for a bolder, more assertive highball. It will, however, significantly raise the alcohol content as well, so some restraint may be necessary if making more than one. The final ingredient in this three-ingredient drink is the soda. Kilgore doesn’t specify between ginger beer or ginger ale, but there is a noticeable difference. Unlike ginger ale, ginger beer is naturally fermented, giving it a more robust and fresh flavor, with heavier ginger spices, lighter sweetness and, sometimes, a cloudiness that comes from the ginger and yeast.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-zapatero/,Zapatero,Liquor.com,"Normally, most cocktails have a single base spirit that they’re built around, like the Bourbon Old Fashioned , Gimlet and Margarita . However, using more than one spirit can introduce complexities that a single spirit never could. The trick is finding a complementary pairing with a strong balance. In the Zapatero, a tweak on the Old Fashioned from California bartender Jeremy Lake, smokey mezcal is married with bourbon and sweetened by orgeat. This earthy, smoke-tinged take on the Old Fashioned uses El Silencio, a mezcal made by a ninth generation mezcalero. A reasonably priced mezcal, El Silencio has a nice balance of minerality, smoke and earthiness, making it a reliable choice for use in cocktails. Other popular choices for similarly priced mezcals of reputable quality include Banhez, Del Maguey Vida and Union Uno Mezcal. While mezcal is the main spirit in the drink, it gets some bourbon for additional depth and those familiar Old Fashioned notes of caramel, vanilla, oak and spices. Lake uses Booker’s Bourbon in his recipe. There’s only a half-ounce of the bourbon in the Zapatero, so buying a bottle wouldn’t raise the overall cost of the drink by much, but a small volume like that also means that substituting another bourbon won’t affect the quality of the finished product. A bottling like Knob Creek Bourbon, also crafted by Beam Suntory but retailing at half the price, would fill in nicely. Rather than using simple syrup, Lake opts for orgeat in his Mexican take on the Old Fashioned. This rich and cloudy syrup is traditionally made with almonds and orange flower water. There are a number of bottled versions on the market: BG Reynolds , Fee Brothers and Orgeat Works each make a stand-up version of the famed Tiki syrup. But if you plan on making a big batch of Zapateros—or other orgeat drinks like the Mai Tai —it can be a worthwhile endeavor to try making your own . Beyond almonds, orgeat can also be made with nuts like hazelnuts or pistachios. Finally, a mix of aromatic and chocolate bitters round the drink out and give it a balanced structure and add depth to the flavor profile.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'orgeat'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'cranberry', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the mezcal, bourbon, orgeat, Angostura bitters and Aztec chocolate bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into an Old Fashioned glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with cinnamon, cranberry and an orange twist.']",25,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kentucky-river/,Kentucky River,Liquor.com,"The Old Fashioned is about as classic a cocktail as you can get. It’s the literal definition of “cocktail,” as it features a mix of spirits, sugar, bitters and ice. Because of that flexible template, though, an Old Fashioned provides ample opportunity for alterations . This one comes by way of the Rosina in the Palazzo at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, an opulent hotel bar that draws guests in with its art deco vibe and keeps them there with its extensive craft cocktail menu. Sweeter and richer than your average Old Fashioned, the Kentucky River is an unconventional but appealing take on the classic, full of chocolate and fruit notes. While most Old Fashioned recipes tend to be drier and more spirit-forward, the Kentucky River is gentler and sweeter thanks to its substitutions. It still starts with bourbon, though, like many Old Fashioneds. The Palazzo at the Venetian uses Buffalo Trace, but feel free to substitute with whatever your favorite bourbon is. Don’t be afraid to substitute a rye whiskey, either, as the additional heat and spice will balance the drink’s sweetness. The biggest deviation from the base recipe is in how the drink is sweetened. Rather than using the traditional simple syrup (or even a sugar cube), the Kentucky River calls for a half-ounce of creme de cacao. This sweet and creamy liqueur gives the drink a rich, chocolatey nuance. And rather than the more commonplace Angostura bitters, it takes a few dashes of peach bitters. The bitters won’t affect the sweetness of Kentucky River, but they do emphasize the fruitiness of it, rather than balance it with the spice of Angostura bitters. The result won’t win over every palate, but those who appreciate richer drinks will likely love this as an after-dinner libation. 11 Fresh Takes on the Old Fashioned RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'creme de cacao'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, creme de cacao and bitters into a double Old Fashioned glass with a large 2-inch ice cube and stir until well-chilled.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",55,bourbon
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/shandy-maker/,Shandy Maker,Liquor.com,"Beer-based cocktails aren’t yet the most popular category of drinks, only occasionally making their way on to bar and restaurant menus. However, they have seen something of a boom in popularity over the last decade, and beer drinks are an incredibly diverse category, from the classic, refreshing Shandy and its variations to hot mulled ales . The Shandy Maker leans towards the brighter and juicier side of the beer cocktail spectrum, relying on a hoppy, floral IPA and fresh herbs. But though the Shandy Maker has beer and citrus juice, it pushes the definition of a Shandy with the addition of an overproof bourbon. While plenty of drinks call for muddled fresh herbs, the vast majority call for fresh mint. This drink looks at another part of the herb garden, opting for marjoram instead. These small, slightly fuzzy leaves are closely related to oregano, and have some similar characteristics. However, where oregano is a savory herb, marjoram has a brighter, sweeter smell and more citrus notes, which pairs well with the other ingredients. For the 100-proof bourbon, the recipe calls for Old Forester. Rarely going above $30 a bottle but of good quality, the brand is an excellent choice for use in cocktails like the Shandy Maker. If you have another 100-proof bourbon in your home bar, feel free to swap it for that. Similarly, the drink calls for Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA, a widely available ale from the famous beer state of Oregon. With strong citrus and floral notes, it plays well with the marjoram and citrus juices, but again you can use a comparable beer, like a nice fresh-hopped IPA. Since it is, technically, a Shandy, the drink also calls for fresh squeezed citrus juice—in this case it’s a mix of grapefruit and lemon juice. Since they’re both rather tart, the drink also gets simple syrup for balance. The result is a variety of summery flavors that blend together nicely, perfect for a hot afternoon on a patio or porch. 11 Summer Shandy Variations to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2 to 4', 'unit': 'leaves', 'ingredient': 'fresh marjoram'}, {'quantity': '1 3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'IPA'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['In a mixing glass, dry-muddle the marjoram.', 'Add the Old Forester bourbon, grapefruit juice, lemon juice and simple syrup into the mixing glass.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/family-traditions/,Family Traditions,Caroline Hatchett,"Even serious craft bartenders like to have a little fun. That’s kind of the whole point of drinking, and the Family Traditions exemplifies that attitude. The playful highball comes from Kyle Beach, the general manager of Buxton Hall in Asheville, North Carolina, and its ingredient list reads like Appalachian magic: bourbon, house-made Mountain Dew syrup and Tang, the concentrated orange drink powder popularized by astronauts in the early 1960s. The drink was a way for Beach to weave personal narrative and regional history into Buxton’s bar program. Beach’s grandfather Jesse Beach was a tenant farmer and factory worker in eastern North Carolina with a penchant for doctored whiskey. “[Jesse] was a bit of a louse, a moonshiner, a penny poker player and, most certainly, a cheating womanizer and poor husband to my grandmother Mildred,” says Beach. “While grandma was off doing farm work before her wait shift at R&C Restaurant, my grandfather would be in his recliner, watching soap operas and drinking Ancient Ancient Age bourbon with Mountain Dew and a tablespoon of Tang mixed in.” This beloved combination of bourbon, Dew and Tang was “so saccharine sweet it’d make your mouth pucker,” says Beach. Beach wanted to honor family drinking lore, along with the story of the South in the 1950s and 1960s, but first he had to do away with the Dew. His solution was to make citrus soda, starting with an orange-lime oleo saccharum laced with malic and citric acids to give it that soft-drink zing. “While it’s not a direct representation of Mountain Dew, the soda itself is quite good, and Mountain Dew fans can taste the resemblance,” he says. Buxton Hall Buxton’s bar team, led by Brandon Grogan, batches the oleo with bourbon and soda water and kegs the whole concoction. And instead of grandpa’s original Tang, they rim glasses with a mixture of dehydrated orange zest, sugar and citric acid.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/torres-riot-act/,Riot Act,Liquor.com,"This Spanish brandy cocktail comes from bartender Jillian Vose of New York City’s famed Irish bar the Dead Rabbit . Though putting the final touches together is as easy as making any standard cocktail, there is a bit of preparation to be done ahead time, including making a grilled-pineapple genever and a brown rice syrup. The end result is a unique, flavorful cocktail that is impossible to replicate without these ingredients. The base of the cocktail is split between a Spanish brandy (Vose specifically chooses Torres 15, an affordable but high-quality brandy) and pineapple-infused genever. Genever is similar to gin (and is at times referred to as Dutch gin), but is its own unique spirit category . Malty and herbal, in this recipe it gets infused with charred pineapple for 12 hours, giving it bright, fruity richness without being overly sweet. Amaro Nonino, a mild grappa-based amaro, gives the drink additional nuance and depth, while a homemade brown rice syrup sweetens things and gives them a nutty complexity. Vose makes it with genmaicha, a type of green tea from Japan that includes toasted, popped rice kernels. The final element that needs to be prepped ahead of time is the saline solution—typically, it’s 2 parts salt to 8 parts water. Rather than making the drink overtly salty, it enhances and amplifies the other ingredients, just like salting a meal . A dash of Bitter Truth aromatic bitters finishes the drink, though Angostura bitters can be used in a pinch.

This Grilled Pineapple Mojito is especially adept at helping you experience a tropical getaway, even if that getaway is only taking place inside your home. The cocktail comes from Johnny Swet, the co-owner and bartender of JIMMY at ModernHaus in New York City. He was inspired to create the drink, which is topped with charred pieces of the juicy fruit, after eating tacos al pastor in Mexico. “Not only does grilled pineapple add a great visual element to a drink, but it also adds a more complex sweetness and acidic component,” he says. “Because of the caramelization that occurs as a result of grilling, the pineapple pairs well with barrel-aged rums.” He chooses a Dominican rum that has been aged and filtered. So, while it appears clear, it’s loaded with fruit flavors alongside notes of coffee, cocoa, butter and vanilla. For even more flavor, Swet muddles mint with the lime juice and agave before shaking everything together. Once in the glass, the drink is topped with the grilled pineapple, which gives off sweet, roasted aromatics while also providing you with a tasty snack. 11 Absolutely Mouthwatering Pineapple Cocktails RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'pineapple chunks'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Gently muddle the agave nectar, lime juice and mint sprig in a Collins glass.', 'Add the pineapple juice and stir to combine.', 'Add crushed ice and top with the rum and grilled pineapple chunks.', 'Garnish with mint leaves.']",33,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sea-of-confusion/,Sea of Confusion,Liquor.com,"Houston Eaves, the beverage director at The Esquire Tavern in San Antonio, oversees the menu, crafting visually stunning drinks like the Sea of Confusion. This beauty is served tall over crushed ice and gets a layered effect from a float of Angostura bitters and Lemon Hart 151 rum. The funky goodness of Hamilton Jamaican pot-still gold rum takes a slightly fruity, floral and bitter turn when it mixes with Clear Creek pear brandy, yellow Chartreuse and Cappelletti amaro sfumato rabarbaro. There’s a lot going on in the Sea of Confusion, and while it’s best made with the listed ingredients, even with substitutions it will come out well. For instance, Lemon Hart 151—an overproof demerara rum that is a darling of the Tiki fanatic community and rum obsessives everywhere—has the habit of disappearing from shelves for a while, and it’s not readily available everywhere. It’s also not the kind of thing that can be swapped out for a more commonplace 151-proof rum like Bacardi’s, but there are alternatives. The most obvious and suitable alternative is Hamilton 151, another highly regarded demerara rum, and one that can generally be found on liquor store shelves. The base of the drink is made with Hamilton’s Jamaican pot-still gold rum, so using the label for the overproof float makes a kind of sense. Similarly, Clear Creek makes a lauded pear eau-de-vie . Made from 100% Bartlett pears picked just hours from the distillery in Hood River, Oregon, the pear brandy is packed with pear flavor without being overly sweet, and works beautifully in both cocktails and as a sipping brandy. However, there are some strong competitors out there, including St. George Spirits in Alameda, California and New Deal Distillery , just a short jaunt from Clear Creek in Portland, Oregon. Either can be used in place of the Clear Creek, if needed or desired. The yellow Chartreuse and the Cappelletti amaro are less flexible. The first is the sibling to the famous green Chartreuse , though it’s a bit sweeter and has a different botanical blend. Similarly, the bold and assertively smoky rhubarb-based liqueur from Cappelletti doesn’t have a lot of analogues on the market. With so many intense liquors going into the drink, it looks like it would be overbearing. However, everything is balanced out with passion fruit syrup and lemon juice for sweetness and tartness, making this a vaguely Tiki-oriented cocktail.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-slivopolitan/,Slivopolitan,Dushan Zaric,"Just as with a skilled cook, it’s often said that a great bartender can make anything taste good. However, in reality, there are several types of liquor that are very difficult to use in cocktails—even for pros like me. It takes some creativity to balance these stubborn spirits with other ingredients while not completely covering them up or having them dominate the drink. One such spirit is the Eastern European plum brandy called slivovitz. Aged or un-aged, it does not matter. The thing that makes it so hard to use is that it usually overtakes anything else it’s mixed with. It is strong, it is pungent, and sometimes it is oaky. Slivovitz behaves like a bull in a china shop, and when you taste it, you will be carrying it with you for the rest of the day or night, just like when you eat fresh garlic. So, what should you do with it? Europeans usually drink it neat. You can follow suit and not bother adding anything to the flavorful liquor. Just pour it into a glass and tip it back. But for years bartenders have tried combining it with orange curaçao, bitters, vermouth and egg whites without much success. In all my years behind the stick, I only could make slivovitz taste great in one thing: The Slivopolitan. This cocktail merges slivovitz with Cointreau , plum puree and fresh lime juice, and it’s actually a pretty good drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/twist-my-armagnac/,Twist My Armagnac,Liquor.com,"Generally, when people think of fine brandies, their minds tend to go to Cognac , the legendary spirit-producing region near the west coast of France. But while cognacs tend to dominate the conversation around European brandies, their relatives to the south just might be better for cocktails. Generally more affordable, especially for the younger ones, the bold and assertive profile of Armagnac comes through clear in drinks like the cleverly named Twist My Armagnac. With a bit of vodka and pineapple to tease out Armagnac’s subtleties, it’s a great introduction for those who have never used the spirit in a cocktail. Bartending veteran Brian Means developed the Twist My Armagnac while working at San Francisco’s Dirty Habit . In it, he uses Tariquet Classique VS Armagnac, a relatively affordable but high quality example of the style. Despite it being an Armagnac drink, however, the base is split between it and vodka—specifically Belvedere vodka. As with most vodka drinks, especially those with a number of other ingredients, feel free to substitute whatever vodka you most like using for the Belvedere, if desired. Pineapple juice adds even more brightness to bring out the fruity notes of Armagnac. You can use canned pineapple juice, but fresh squeezed will add more floral and tart elements. The drink is balanced with a bit of lemon juice for additional tangy acid and a rich demerara syrup, which brings more depth and warmer flavors than a traditional white sugar simple syrup. The Twist My Armagnac is a great introduction to the lauded French brandy style. If it does its job and convinces you to love Armagnac, you can try the brandy in recipes like a Brandy Old Fashioned , replace some or all of the rye whiskey or cognac in a Sazerac or use it in Sazerac variations like the Saz With a Sting .

And while it’s nowhere near as popular as other plenty of other rum drinks, or Campari drinks like the Negroni or Boulevardier , it’s admired enough that it gets the occasional tweak or variations. Vuelo de la Selva translates to “Flight of the Jungle,” or simply Jungle Flight, in Spanish. The drink comes from bartending icon Ivy Mix, owner of the New York City bar Leyenda and founder of the feminist bartending competition Speed-Rack . One of the most salient changes is to the base spirit: rather than the rum traditionally used in a Jungle Bird, Mix substitutes some of it for Torres 15 brandy, a well-regarded and reasonably priced Spanish brandy. However, there’s still a splash of rum in the drink: half an ounce of any Jamaican rum you’d want to use. The other major change is to the liqueur. Instead of Campari, Mix uses Contratto Bitter liqueur, one of the many relatively new liqueurs on the market that compete with Campari. Much like its crimson predecessor, Contratto Bitter is bittersweet, crimson and heavily botanical, infused with orange peel, cardamom, gentian, juniper berries, mint, ginger, rhubarb and sage. The rest of the drink is essentially the same as making a Jungle Bird, with pineapple and lime juice as well as some simple syrup for sweetness. The Vuelo de la Selva is a good example of how changing a few of the base ingredients, even to something similar, can bring a new take to the drink.

It’s used in Indian curries and other beloved dishes, plus drinks like Golden Milk Tea, a combination of coconut milk, turmeric and honey. Saffron NOLA , a modern Indian restaurant in New Orleans, deftly employs the earthy root in its kitchen and behind the bar. The elegant space and menu are enhanced by general manager and beverage director Ashwin Vilkhu’s cocktails, which showcase Indian ingredients while riffing on the classics. Inspired by an elixir of warm milk, honey and turmeric that his mom would give him before bed, the Anti-Inflammatory also plays off a New Orleans staple, the Brandy Milk Punch , a blend of milk, brandy, vanilla extract and powdered sugar. The soothing drink combines cognac with turmeric-infused coconut milk and honey syrup over crushed ice, garnished with a cilantro sprig and drops of chile oil. Vilkhu dry-shakes the cognac, coconut milk and honey, creating a frothy mixture that’s rich and luxurious. The chile oil brings a hint of spice with each sip, while the cilantro provides bright, herbal aromas.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/betsy-ross/,Betsy Ross,Gary Regan,"The arrival of Presidents’ Day presents a great excuse to hoist a Betsy Ross cocktail, and if you’ve never tried one, I urge you to mix one up. It’s a darned good quaff and perfect for toasting the guys who’ve led our country since 1789, the year George Washington was elected. Ross, the woman who supposedly sewed the first stars-and-stripes flag, knew Washington quite well, it seems—her pew at church was right next to George and Martha’s. However, the tipple named for her, as far as I can tell, didn’t appear in print until the 1940s—I found the formula in Crosby Gaige’s “Cocktail Guide and Ladies’ Companion,” published in 1941. Port and brandy form the backbone of the concoction. Thankfully, it’s now fairly easy to find good American brandies, so if you’re going to do a little patriotic drinking, I suggest a California bottling. The same applies to the port, too, but I’m afraid we’re heading to foreign climes for the other two ingredients. Angostura Bitters , made in Trinidad, plays an important role in the drink, and I’m a hog for the stuff—while the recipe calls for only two dashes, I usually double up on the bitters if making one for myself. Try it; you just might like it. The final ingredient is the orange liqueur curaçao. Be careful when you’re buying the spirit, since many brands tend to be overly sweet. Recently, a new bottle landed on my doorstep—yes, yes, it was a freebie—but I was really impressed by its dryness and complexity. If you can find it, use Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao Ancienne Methode in your Betsy Ross. You’ll thank me for this. I’ll let you get on with your celebrations, but I have a last word of advice: If you take advantage of one of the car sales that are bound to dominate our television sets this long weekend, do it before you start sipping a Betsy Ross.

However, the julep extends beyond the bourbon-laced version and is a category of drinks that features a spirit served over crushed ice. That means you can make all manner of juleps with different spirits, liqueurs and non-alcoholic ingredients. One example is the Napoleon Julep from Nick Bennett, the beverage director at Porchlight in New York City. Bennett’s julep skips whiskey entirely, opting instead to feature cognac in the starring role. He joins that cognac with St-Germain elderflower liqueur, homemade green tea syrup and mole bitters for a drink that’s fruity, spiced and flavorful, while the mint and lemon zest garnishes keep their fresh fragrances front and center.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/1928-sea-breeze/,1928 Sea Breeze,Liquor.com,"The classic Sea Breeze cocktail combines vodka, cranberry juice and grapefruit juice and is an icon of 1980s drinking culture. But it’s likely that some form of the drink originated decades earlier. The Sea Breeze Cooler, for example, combines gin with apricot brandy, lemon and grenadine and appeared in cocktail books as early as 1930. Another version stems from the 1960s, where it’s closely tied to an Ocean Spray recipe booklet that promoted cranberries for use in food and drinks. So, the drink’s legacy extends beyond the vodka-fueled craze of the ’80s, which also gave us other vodka-cranberry creations like the Cape Codder . The 1928 Sea Breeze belongs to David Moo, the owner of Quarter Bar in Brooklyn. His mashup of old and new features gin, grenadine and fresh grapefruit juice and was concocted in 2013 after he found an old Sea Breeze recipe. “I was browsing cocktail recipes when I came across it,” he says. ""It wasn’t necessarily in an old book—I actually don’t remember where I found it. But I do remember reading that the original recipe was from the 1920s, but it didn’t give an exact year, and it involved gin. I thought, ‘That sounds like a considerably better drink.’ So I made one for myself, and it was delicious. I put it on the menu.” He dubbed it the 1928 Sea Breeze, choosing the year at random in a nod to the cocktail’s lengthy history. Moo builds the drink in a tall glass with plenty of ice, no garnish, so you should do the same. Grab a bottle of dry gin, squeeze a grapefruit and make a quick batch of grenadine. Homemade pomegranate grenadine is key, as its rich, tart flavor adds depth and complexity in addition to sweetness, unlike the bright-red commercial versions, which are artificially colored and cloying.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/raspberry-collins/,Raspberry Collins,Liquor.com,"The classic Collins formula is simple: a base spirit, some citrus, a sweetener and a carbonated ingredient. The most famous example of all, the Tom Collins , follows that template and features gin, lemon juice, simple syrup and club soda in a well-balanced and refreshing package that has been quenching thirsts since the 19th century. The recipe is a winning combination, but it still leaves room for enterprising bartenders and drinkers to add their own marks with fruits, herbs, liqueurs and other modifiers. The Raspberry Collins tweaks the classic with—you guessed it—raspberries. The vitamin-packed fruit is muddled with simple syrup, creating a quick raspberry syrup that infuses the cocktail with a rich blend of sweetness and tartness. That flavor carries through into the dry, botanical gin and fresh lemon juice, and it’s all tied together with an effervescent pour of club soda. Keep the process simple by building the drink in the same glass you serve it in, so you don’t need to bother with mixing glasses or shaker tins. And if you don’t have a muddler, don’t fret—a wooden spoon or the flat end of a bar spoon can do the job. You can showcase the Raspberry Collins whenever raspberries are in season, which is usually summer through fall. Besides being delicious, it’s also a gorgeous-looking drink, making it a perfect choice for group brunches, parties, showers and other celebrations.

The drink evokes childhood lemonade stands and summer nostalgia, but one of the best parts about being an adult is the ability to spike that lemonade with your spirit of choice. The Strawberry Basil Lemonade takes this to heart, calling for a slug of gin in addition to strawberry, basil leaves, lemonade and club soda. The result is bright and bracing, with the botanical gin complementing the fruit, herbs and tart lemon. Like many good drinks featuring fruit and herbs, the Strawberry Basil Lemonade begins with a muddler . Gently muddle the basil leaves and strawberry to extract the flavors, being careful not to pulverize the basil, as that yields a bitterness you don’t want in your glass. The muddled ingredients are then combined in the glass with shaken gin and lemonade, topped with club soda for a dash of effervescence, and garnished with basil leaves and a strawberry slice. It’s difficult to imagine a more hydrating and delicious way to pass the time on warm days. The Strawberry Basil Lemonade tastes great with gin, but you can also make a similarly solid drink with vodka. Or, you can go the opposite route by skipping the liquor entirely and using this template to make a mocktail, giving you all the refreshment with none of the booze. If you’re serving a crowd, make some drinks with liquor and others without, and everyone—even non-drinkers and underage guests—will get to participate.

For proof, look to the French Press Sangria, a fun, large-format take on classic Sangria that combines red and white wine with rum, cognac, orange liqueur, agave syrup, raspberry puree and multiple types of fruit.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/raisin-cane/,Raisin’ Cane,Liquor.com,"The aperitif Pineau des Charentes is cognac’s lesser-known cousin, a combination of fresh grape juice, or lightly fermented grape must, with un-aged cognac. While popular in its home in Western France, it has yet to develop a broad audience in the United States. Nevertheless, a handful of bars and restaurants across the country have discovered its use in cocktails. For instance, Downstairs at The Esquire Tavern in San Antonio has long praised Pineau and always has a bottle on the backbar. Bar manager Myles Worrell crafted the Raisin’ Cane at the request of a customer who had tried the Pineau des Charentes on its own, and wanted a cocktail made from it. The result was an on-the-fly concoction, but one that was good enough to stick around. Though the Pineau des Charentes is the base of the drink, it’s bolstered with a half-ounce of rum. Rather than one from the Carribbean or South America, as it most common, Worrell uses Paranubes Oaxacan rum from Mexico. If you can’t get your hands on a bottle, the closest substitution would be a rhum agricole , as both styles are un-aged and use pure sugar cane, rather than molasses. Amontillado sherry pairs naturally with rum and with brandy-based spirits, and has the benefit of adding a robustness and nuttiness to the cocktail without raising its alcohol content too much. Because Pineau des Charentes has a relatively low alcohol content itself, usually less than 20%, the result tastes bold and spirit-forward, but ends up with a lower proof than a traditional stirred cocktail. And it wouldn’t be a proper stirred cocktail without bitters. Rather than Angostura or a similarly familiar product, Worrell uses Xocolatl Mole bitters from Bittermens, one of the most prominent bitters company on the market. 3 Great Cocktails Made with the Boozy Fortified Wine Pineau de Charentes FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Pierre Ferrand Pineau des Charentes aperitif'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Paranubes Oaxacan rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'El Maestro Sierra amontillado sherry'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'Bittermens Xocolatl Mole bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Pineau des Charentes aperitif, Oaxacan rum, amontillado sherry and Xocolatl mole bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Express the oil from a grapefruit peel over top.', 'Garnish with a grapefruit twist.']",0,rum

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/golden-sazerac/,Golden Sazerac,Liquor.com,"The Sazerac is an essential classic. This venerable cocktail dates back more than a century, and is the official drink of New Orleans. At its core a twist on an Old Fashioned , it swaps out the ice cube for a chilled rocks glass and adds absinthe and Peychaud’s bitters, giving it notes of anise and a bright crimson color. These days, ordering a Sazerac in a cocktail bar will likely result in one made with rye whiskey. But the Golden Sazerac, from bartending icon Giuseppe González, hews closer to what the original recipe for the drink was likely made with, with cognac instead of rye. González created the Golden Sazerac at Suffolk Arms for Cognac Classics Week. Besides the use of cognac and the abundance of Peychaud’s bitters (González uses 6 dashes rather than the more common 3), the other change is a subtle one. Rather than simple syrup or a sugar cube, as is sometimes used, González uses Lyle’s golden syrup . This English syrup is around the same age as the Sazerac itself, dating back to 19th Century London. Sold in tins that still use the brand’s original design, this rich, amber-hued syrup is more like honey than simple syrup, though it is made with cane sugar. It can even be used in place of honey syrup in drinks like the Bee’s Knees or Brown Derby .

https://www.liquor.com/breakfast-martini-recipe-4796353,Burrata Breakfast Martini,Kat Odell,"Tinkering with whey in cocktails was the first step that led Piper Kristensen to build a drink with burrata water. The beverage director at Brooklyn bistro Oxalis created the Breakfast Martini, citing the “great texture” that whey—the watery byproduct of making cheese or yogurt—can add to a drink, but she also calls out the liquid’s acidic nature. “That's when we thought of using [burrata] water.” High in protein, with a delicate salinity, burrata water—the liquid in which some burrata producers store their creamy cheese—seemed like a potential win. It’s also an eco-friendly way to repurpose a byproduct from Oxalis’ summer menu that chef Nico Russell would otherwise have discarded. When initially considering a recipe for his Breakfast Martini, Kristensen says, “I wanted the burrata water to be the dilution component.” As a test, Kristensen added it to a stirred cocktail in effort to boost the drink’s texture, and he says that the drink became milky and curdled in appearance, similar to the ouzo effect. As an example, consider the opaque result of blending water with ouzo or absinthe. Rather than two clear liquids remaining transparent, when mixed together, they yield a cloudy elixir. “Technically, I don't think it's a traditional louche, or ouzo effect, but it looks the same,” he says. Instead, Kristensen believes the mixture’s opaque appearance to be the result of alcohol denaturing the burrata water’s proteins. “The proteins that are distributed throughout the burrata water coagulate [when blended with booze], and the mixture gets milky,” he says. This makes it great for mediating the intersection of sweet and sour in cocktails. Observing the cloudy blend, Kristensen realized that the resulting liquid acted in a similar manner to the way egg whites behave in a drink, adding body. And so he experimented with using the burrata water “as an egg white-style foaming agent,” he says. The result is not entirely dissimilar to another newer and trendy cocktail frothing ingredient: chickpea brine, or aquafaba. When a bartender shakes a drink with aquafaba, the cocktail emerges with a thick foaming head, as if it were shaken with egg whites. And since chickpea brine is plant-based, it has become a popular ingredient at bars that cater to vegans. And like aquafaba, Kristensen’s idea of shaking a cocktail with burrata water worked, yielding a beautiful white, frothy liquid. Kristensen then chose to fortify his Burrata Breakfast Martini with gomme syrup for extra structural support and viscosity. A splash of mandarin distillate, plus fresh lemon juice, rounds out the smooth, floral libation. For home bartenders who don’t have access to mandarin distillate—a high-proof spirit that is produced by a small distillery on Long Island, N.Y. called Matchbook Distilling Company —Kristensen suggests swapping in 2 ounces of Plymouth gin or another gin of the drink-maker’s choice.","[{'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Letherbee gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Matchbook Distilling Company mandarin distillate'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'burrata water'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gomme syrup*'}]","['Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a chilled coupe glass.']",11,gin

This includes, of course, the world of bartending , with drink creators finding inspiration in the people and figures of the Star War universe. The Blue Milk of Tatooine is named for the beverage that Luke Skywalker, his uncle Owen and aunt Berlu drink in their hut on the overutilized desert planet. The Blue Milk of Tatooine has an advantage over many other Star Wars-inspired drinks, as it’s based on a fictional beverage instead of a character or a vague concept . Created by Karen Grill of Sassafras Saloon in Los Angeles, it’s essentially a blue-hued Piña Colada variation (like the Blue Hawaiian ), and it’s everything you’d want in a liquid ode to Luke Skywalker’s family breakfast. Like the original Colada, it strikes a lovely balance of citrus, sweetness and creamy nuttiness along with a touch of extra botanicals. Unlike the Piña Colada, however, the Blue Milk of Tatooine calls for gin as its base spirit, which makes it lighter and more herbal. In order to get a bit of vanilla back in, which rum would normally provide, the drink takes a vanilla syrup rather than a traditional simple syrup. You can use a store-bought brand, like Giffard, or you can make your own . Of course, it wouldn’t be the the Blue Milk of Tatooine unless it was blue. It gets its azure hue the way many drinks do: from blue curaçao. You can easily find this sweet citrus liqueur at liquor stores, but if you have the time and inclination you can make an impressive version at home .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/federal-ave-swizzle/,Federal Ave. Swizzle,Liquor.com,"The Swizzle is an interesting category of drinks: unlike most others, it adheres more to a style of presentation than it does to ingredients. Swizzles, by definition, are made in tall glasses over crushed or pebble ice and stirred back and forth, or “swizzled,” with a long-stemmed bar spoon or similar tool known as a swizzle stick. Bartender McLain Hedges created the Federal Ave. Swizzle at the now-closed RiNo Yacht Club in Denver, Colorado. With a bevy of odd ingredients and a complicated, labor-intensive syrup, it’s not one for the casual home bartender. While its base is gin, it combines a variety of different ingredients, yielding a drink that’s both refreshing and memorable. The first step in crafting the Federal Ave. Swizzle is to make the spiced syrup. This large-volume syrup is intended for batching at bars and is difficult to convert to a smaller volume. It’s best to make it for dinner parties and other kinds of get togethers so that you won’t be stuck with a quart of it. Zesty, herbaceous and slightly peppery, it is a unique and flavorful syrup, so feel free to try it in other drinks, like a Tom Collins or Gimlet , to see if it fits. The base spirit for the swizzle is Fords Gin , a London dry gin specifically designed for cocktail bartenders. It also sees equal parts of sake and coconut water, making it bright, refreshing and with a silky mouthfeel. Turmeric juice (which cannot be substituted by powdered turmeric) adds a warm but subtle pepperiness, as well as a touch of gold color. 8 Swizzles to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fords Gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sake'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'coconut water'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'turmeric juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'spiced syrup*'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'sprig', 'ingredient': 'mint'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Fords gin, sake, coconut water, lime juice, turmeric juice and spiced syrup into a highball glass, fill the glass halfway with crushed ice, and swizzle for 10 seconds.', 'Top with more crushed ice.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig and lime twist.']",8,gin

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-gin-mule/,Gin-Gin Mule,Liquor.com,"This gingery, minty wonder was originally created by Audrey Saunders as a gateway gin drink for vodka lovers. But over the years, the Gin-Gin Mule has become much more—a symbol of both the New York City cocktail renaissance and the generation of female bartending icons integral to it. The Gin-Gin Mule was synonymous with Saunders’ beloved Pegu Club, which was a Manhattan institution before its heartbreaking closure in 2020. If the Gin-Gin Mule’s build feels familiar, it’s because what you’re looking at is essentially a gin Mojito—with the addition of ginger beer. This cocktail was a staple at Pegu Club throughout the iconic New York City bar’s 15-year tenure, and it’s an easy modern classic sure to please any crowd (although more guests means more muddling, so be prepared). Here are a few tips for making the perfect Gin-Gin Mule at home: Homemade ginger beer won’t be fizzy and can be shaken with the rest of the liquid ingredients. If you’re going with bottled or canned, which will generally be carbonated, you’ll want to shake the other liquid ingredients and strain over ice before topping the drink with the ginger beer. Also, when muddling mint (or any other herb, for that matter), remember: Bruise it, don’t abuse it. Aggressive muddling can release undesirable flavor qualities, such as bitterness. Keep it gentle for best results.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/diy-pink-gin/,Pink Gin Cocktail,Alex Frane,"A strange relic of the post-Prohibition cocktail era, the Pink Gin is a cocktail rarely found on bar menus these days. Adapted from the 1939 classic cocktail book “The Gentleman’s Companion” by Charles H. Baker, the original cocktail nods to the drink’s Navy roots when medicinal bitters were, reportedly, added to gin to encourage sailors to take them. It’s about as simple as one can get while still considering a beverage a cocktail: two ingredients, gin and Angostura bitters, are stirred over ice and served in a chilled glass. While it’s easy, and accurate, to say that the simplicity of the cocktail belies its complexity and depth, it’s much harder to claim the drink as excessively palatable. Without the balance of some kind of sweetener, like simple syrup or vermouth, the Pink Gin is aggressively bracing, necessarily served as ice cold as possible and more diluted than your average Martini in order to make it potable. The four dashes of bitters do add a pleasant hue to the cocktail (though arguably more orange than pink), but they threaten to overwhelm the already herbal liquor with their baking spice botanicals. One possible solution to the issue of an overly bitter drink is to use an old tom gin rather than a London dry style. This historic gin style disappeared for a number of decades, but today is back on bar shelves thanks to efforts from historians like David Wondrich and distillers like Tad Seestedt of Ransom Spirits in Oregon. The aged gin is sweeter thanks to its time in barrels, and its botanicals are often less-juniper forward, with warmer, richer spices that pair well with Angostura bitters. You can even considering adding a dash of simple syrup, though at that point you’re treading close to it being a twist on an Old Tom Old Fashioned. Recipes differ slightly in how to build the Pink Gin, despite its limited ingredients. Though some have the bartender stir the bitters in the mixing glass with the gin, others use them as a rinse for the cocktail glass first. In his book, Baker suggested the excess bitters from the rinse were to “go back in the bottle, on the floor or out the porthole or window, depending upon who, where and what we are.” In the end, it’s a peculiar, singular drink, and one that every gin-lover should try at least once, if only to say they have.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/kumquat-smash/,Kumquat Smash,Liquor.com,"When it comes to citrus in cocktails, the usual suspects are limes, lemons, grapefruits and, to a slightly lesser extent, oranges. But the wide and wild world of the sweet-tart tree fruits includes plenty of others, including the diminutive, thin-skinned kumquat . They’re not the most likely candidate for cocktails, considering they’re nearly impossible to squeeze, giving up little of their tart juices. But bartender Dimitris Kiakos of the now-closed but legendary Gin Joint in Athens, Greece, puts them to good use in his Kumquat Squash. The Kumquat Smash starts by muddling the small yet flavor-rich citrus fruit, which releases as much of their juice as possible while also macerating the edible skins, where the fruit gets much of its sweetness. This bright, floral juice provides a fresh and unique base for the drink. The cocktail itself is made with Old Tom gin —this historic gin style was lost for decades until Oregon distiller Tad Seestedt and cocktail historian David Wondrich collaborated on revivifying it with Ransom Old Tom gin . Old Tom is sweeter and (usually) darker than a London dry gin thanks to fact that it’s normally aged in barrels, and often made with malted grains. Some Old Tom gin is almost like a botanical whiskey. However, in the Kumquat Squash, Kiakos uses Hayman’s Old Tom gin , one of the rare versions of the style that is unaged. This means the drink will be bright and fresh—using something like Ransom or another aged Old Tom will bring more color and richness, but that can clash with the kumquats. To heighten the tart juiciness the smash also gets a measure of lemon juice, while maraschino liqueur amplifies the fruity sweet notes. The result is a bright and complex cocktail that can be enjoyed year-round, especially in early spring, when the kumquats are most in-season.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sky-juice/,Sky Juice,Kelly Magyarics,"If looking for refreshment on New Providence Island, you may be tempted to reach for an ice-cold bottle of Kalik or a fruity Bahama Mama . Really, anything with rum seems like the wise course of action if visiting the Bahamas. However, those in the know opt for a drink with a base spirit that seems as out of place as a parka on the island’s beaches, where the average yearly high temperature is 84 degrees and the turquoise waters require zero Instagram filters. It’s not rum that’s poured into the Sky Juice, the Bahamas’ most ubiquitous cocktail—it’s gin. Fifteen minutes outside Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, brightly painted, thatched roof-covered food stands line the streets in the area of Arawak Cay. Known more commonly as Fish Fry, it’s where Bahamian food purveyors beckon vacationers to grab a stool and sample conch in all its iterations: cracked (battered, fried and served with tartar sauce), scorched (a simple ceviche with lime and onions), tropical salad (mixed with mango, pineapple and jalapeño) and fritters, those hush-puppy-like balls of fried deliciousness. It’s also the likely birthplace of Sky Juice. It all started during Prohibition, when thrifty, thirsty Bahamians consumed the clear botanical spirit, more plentiful and cheaper at the time than rum. “Sky Juice, also known as Gully Wash among locals, dates back to the early 20th century [when] locals didn’t have easy access to canned juices or sodas to chase their liquor,” says Enrique Díaz Pérez, the hotel bartender at Meliá, a resort in Nassau. “So indigenous tropical fruit juices like that from coconuts became very popular to mix and make drinks with.” To make Sky Juice, gin is mixed with coconut water and condensed milk, served over ice (in a plastic cup if you order it at Fish Fry) and garnished with freshly grated nutmeg. It’s creamy without being too thick, sweet without being cloying. And the gin adds a cool herbal note that’s so very different than what rums lend to creamy frozen concoctions. “You can get Sky Juice almost anywhere: bars, street vendors, the local fish fry and authentically Bahamian restaurants,” says Perez. “It’s loved by locals and tourists alike.” Everything You Need to Know About Drinking in the Bahamas RELATED ARTICLE It might seem odd to sip a coconut- and milk-based beverage alongside marinated raw fish. But think of it as a deconstructed version of ota ika, the national dish of French Polynesia, which tosses lemon- or lime-marinated fish with coconut milk and diced cucumber, tomato, onion and pepper. As for the name, just like with all booze history, when alcohol is involved, details tend to get fuzzy. Some believe Sky Juice is a reference to the tall trees you need to scale to obtain the milky water-filled coconuts, while others believe it’s because the drink’s color looks like white fluffy clouds. It was invented at Goldie’s Conch House, where they are purposefully leaving the origin open to interpretation. “It’s what we locals call ‘tru tru’ Bahamian, an authentic taste of our culture and heritage,” says Julie Lightbourn, the chef at Sip Sip, with locations at Harbour Island and The Cove at Atlantis, Paradise Island. The drink is so famous in the Bahamas that when the Baha Men aren’t wondering “Who Let the Dogs Out?” they’re singing the praises of “ Gin and Coconut Water .” Not everyone knows how to make it right, though, says Lightbourn, who mixes both “leaded” and family-friendly “unleaded” versions at the resorts. She suggests reaching for a traditional London dry gin like Gilbey’s or Gordon’s and nutmeg pods rather than a sprinkle from a spice jar, because freshly grated makes all the difference. Most importantly, don’t be put off or fooled by this alternative to the frozen poolside sipper. “As with all Bahamian recipes, it’s reputed to put lead in your pencil.”","[{'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'cups', 'ingredient': 'coconut water'}, {'quantity': '14', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'condensed milk'}, {'quantity': '1/3', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg pod'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, coconut water and condensed milk into a pitcher and stir well.', 'Grate 1/3 of the fresh nutmeg pod over the top and stir again.', 'Add each serving into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a footed pilsner glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish each glass with freshly grated nutmeg.']",43,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/diamond-blue/,Diamond Blue,Liquor.com,"In 2010, Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton with a 12-carat sapphire engagement ring. While recreating that moment isn’t feasible for most of us, mixing up this Diamond Blue cocktail most certainly is. It comes from bar veteran Charlotte Voisey, who channeled the royal ring when making this luxurious cocktail. The Blue Diamond begins with gin, a solid choice for any British-leaning drink. From there, it receives a helping hand of flavor and color from crème de violette and blue curaçao . The former is an intensely floral violet liqueur best known for its use in the Aviation , while the latter is an orange liqueur that has been colored blue. They combine to give the cocktail its deep sapphire hue. Voisey also enlists lemon juice, which cuts through the sweet liqueurs and brings balance to the drink. The Champagne lends an effervescent sparkle while also lengthening the cocktail with necessary dryness to counter the strong flavors. And it all gets topped with a garnish of edible silver powder. This ingredient, usually reserved for cakes and other desserts, adds flair to the sophisticated drink. Admittedly, mixing a cocktail isn’t the same as giving someone a massive piece of jewelry. But this Blue Diamond tastes better than a shiny stone, and it’s a lot easier to acquire.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-aristocrat/,Aristocrat,Liquor.com,"The Aristocrat, from Will Thompson of Miami’s Jaguar Sun restaurant, is an unorthodox drink. It’s most closely related to a Champagne Cocktail or French 75 , in that it’s topped with French bubbly; however, rather than brandy, gin or another spirit as its base, it’s a mix of red Burgundy and a strawberry syrup. The pinot noir from France’s Burgundy region is some of the most famous and celebrated wine in the world; it also has a commensurate price tag. Older vintages can easily break into the triple digits, and even the more affordable ones are often around the $40 and $50 mark. You can substitute it using pinot noir from another part of the world, such as Oregon’s famed Willamette Valley. However, they have noticeably different flavor profiles and tend to also be pricey. Luckily, you’ll be using less than two ounces of the red wine in the drink, so you won’t have to be an aristocrat to make one. You may consider making this for an appetizer or for dessert, and have the rest of the bottle of wine to drink with dinner. Dessert may be a better option of the two, as the Aristocrat is on the sweet side of things thanks to the strawberry syrup and the Pimm’s No. 1 , a gin-based, fruit-infused liqueur. Besides its most famous application in a Pimm’s Cup , you can also use the liqueur in drinks like the Pimm’s Coupe and Pimm’s Fizz . The strawberry syrup, too, has plenty of applications.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/takumis-aviation/,Takumi's Aviation,Gary Regan,"In 2010, I tasted the very best Aviation cocktail I’ve ever encountered. And more than a few of these sky-blue babies have glided down my throat over the years. I was in Athens helping to judge the Diageo World Class Bartender Competition , and the bartender who prepared the cocktail was Takumi Watanabe who works (still) at The Sailing Bar in the city of Sakurai, Japan. Takumi’s version of the Aviation took my breath away, and along with a Martinez made for me in London by Ago Perrone in 2006, these are the only two cocktails I’ve tasted in my entire life that have made such a long-lasting impression on me. I never knew what it was that set Takumi’s Aviation apart from the rest, but I recently contacted him to talk about his recipe, and I got a lightbulb moment when he mentioned that since there was no crème de violette available to him at the time he had used Marie Brizard Parfait Amour , a liqueur that’s similar in color to the original ingredient but boasts orange and vanilla notes rather than the more floral notes found in crème de violette. Takumi contacted the good folks at Diageo to confirm what he had told me, but nobody presently working there was in Athens in 2010, so nobody really remembers what he used. Convinced that my Japanese friend’s initial memory of the drink was probably the most accurate record of what went down, I experimented with Takumi’s recipe, and I’m 99.99 percent sure it was Parfait Amour that made his drink so incredibly special.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Tanqueray No. Ten gin'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Giffard Marasquin maraschino liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Marie Brizard Parfait Amour liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/3', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin into a shaker and stir to release the aromas.', 'Add ice and the remaining ingredients and shake until well-chilled.', 'Fine-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",6,gin

Frosty beers are always a fine choice, especially for pairing with football’s favorite foods like wings and nachos, but cocktails also have their place at the bar. So for football season, bartenders from each NFL team’s hometown concocted the perfect drink to represent their team. Enter the Brown & Orange, a Cleveland Browns-themed cocktail from bartender Dave Taha. “This cocktail is basically just whiskey and bitters because Cleveland Browns fans are just that—drunk and bitter,” says Taha. A healthy slug of rye whiskey leads the way, followed by amaro and two types of bitters. But the drink’s not all about bitterness. “The Amaro Nonino Quintessentia lends a touch of sweetness, which acts as the hope we fans have for a perennially doomed team,” he adds. Game day cocktails shouldn’t involve too many flourishes, lest you miss opening kickoff or the game-winning drive while you’re making drinks. That’s why the Brown & Orange is made right in the glass it’s served in, no shaker, mixing glass or strainer required. “No fanfare, just the basics, on ice, in a glass,” says Taha.

Sage simple syrup is more than a nod to the wise Jedi master: It also adds to the vivid green hue of the crushed basil and gives the drink an aromatic depth. If you have leftovers of it, the bright green syrup would work well in, say, a Gimlet , adding even more verdancy and botanical notes. Galligos also notes it would work well in “a variation on an Old-Fashioned with a bold whiskey and some fun bitters ,” as well as a Cobbler using an apple brandy . A large part of the drink’s appeal comes from its appearance. Adding sage leaves clipped to the edge of the glass with the miniature clothespins that are popular in cocktail bars, or just a long pick, amplifies the drink’s similarity to Yoda. Wrap them each in a basil leaf first for an even more pronounced Yoda-like appearance.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Calvados'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'apple cider'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sage simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'basil leaves'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: sage leaves', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Calvados, apple cider, sage simple syrup, lemon juice and basil leaves to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Martini glass.', 'Garnish with 2 fresh sage leaves.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/ti-bijou/,Ti’ Bijou,Liquor.com,"This twist on the Bijou cocktail was created by New York bartender, writer and rum aficionado Shannon Mustipher during her time at the now-closed Glady’s bar in Brooklyn. The classic Bijou features gin, sweet vermouth, green Chartreuse and orange bitters, while Mustipher’s Ti’ Bijou enlists gin as a secondary spirit, instead calling upon earthy rhum agricole as the base spirit. Mustipher starts with Boukman botanical rhum agricole from Haiti. If you can find it, go ahead and do the same. Otherwise, another Haitian rhum agricole like Barbancourt blanc will do the trick. She doubles up the proportion or rhum to gin, and then enlists blanc vermouth, chamomile tea syrup, a pinch of salt and orange bitters, adding everything into a glass that’s been rinsed with absinthe. That absinthe is employed in a similar fashioned to how it’s used in drinks like the Sazerac , where even a small rinse adds notable flavors and aromas to complement the other ingredients. The result is a cocktail that’s earthy and herbaceous, sporting a flavor profile reminiscent of the original Bijou, but with more grassy, herbal and floral notes due to the rhum, absinthe and chamomile tea. The Ti’ Bijou shows what rhum agricole is capable of. It’s not just for Ti’ Punches and Daiquiri riffs. When employed by a skilled barkeep (or adventurous enthusiast), the popular spirit can be incorporated into complex, nuanced cocktails featuring a wide range of ingredients and flavors.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/brothers-keeper/,Brother’s Keeper,Liquor.com,"Rum is a versatile spirit. Though it’s often employed in refreshing, citrusy drinks like the Daiquiri or rich, tropical drinks like the Painkiller , rum is a complex liquor loaded with flavor and nuance that is just as successful in stirred, spirit-forward cocktails. Aged rums, especially, can bring oak and spice notes to traditional whiskey drinks like the Old Fashioned —or, in this case, the Toronto. The Toronto is part Old Fashioned and part Manhattan , combining Canadian rye with the bitter Italian amaro Fernet-Branca , simple syrup and aromatic bitters. It’s deep, dark and bittersweet. At The Patterson House in Nashville, Strategic Hospitality beverage director Matthew Tocco wanted to make a version of the Toronto cocktail that swapped whiskey for aged rum. Tocco’s version, called Brother’s Keeper, uses Ron Zacapa Centenario, a blend of rums aged between six and 23 years that has aromas and flavors of dried fruit, oak, leather, tobacco, coffee and vanilla. He keeps the fernet, tweaks the sugar by using a richer demerara sugar syrup, and adds chocolate bitters to the mix. ""Rum is a product that comes from sugar, so pairing it with sugar makes sense,” says Tocco. “A lot of people associate rum with sweet, fruity drinks, but there are a lot of different ways you can apply it.” With its bittersweet profile and the unmistakable hint of Fernet-Branca, the Brother’s Keeper is recognizable as a Toronto variation, but the rich rum and chocolate bitters move the taste in a different direction. The drink shows what rum can do when swapped in for whiskey, and it may inspire you to experiment with rum in other spirituous whiskey classics. If You Love an Old Fashioned, Try One with Rum.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/italian-bird/,Italian Bird,Liquor.com,"The Jungle Bird cocktail features dark rum, Campari, pineapple juice, lime juice and sugar. It was created in the 1970s, when it was first served as a welcome drink to visitors of the former Kuala Lumpur Hilton. Since then, the Jungle Bird has found its place on Tiki bar menus and earned a spot in the modern-classic cocktail canon. It has even spawned several riffs over the years, including the Italian Bird from DC drinks pro Francesco Amodeo. This nuanced concoction moves away from the Tiki sphere while still delivering a refreshing, bittersweet experience. This cocktail is built around the comfortable confines of aged rum and Campari but then is taken in a new direction with fino sherry , honey syrup and salt. The rum provides a flavorful base, while the Campari lends its trademark notes of bitter orange, rhubarb, cherry and spice. Fino sherry is dry and nutty, adding dimension to the cocktail. The honey syrup sweetens the affair, and the salt ties the room together with a pinch of harmony. Don’t worry about the drink tasting salty at all—the minor pinch merely enhances the other flavors . Rather than calling for pineapple juice like the Jungle Bird normally does, the Italian Bird is juice-free. However, it pays homage to the original with a pineapple sage garnish.

When properly made with an eye to balance and a good rum ( or blend of them ), the Daiquiri can challenge any other drink for cocktail supremacy. But more than just a delicious drink on its own, it operates as a wonderful template for alterations, which has made it extremely popular amongst bartenders. While many are happy enough to add fruit like strawberries or mangos or to swap the simple syrup for maraschino liqueur, the Good Ships / Wood Ships from New Orleans’ Seaworthy adds a few unique ingredients to make an entirely new drink that still harkens back to the original. Seaworthy’s recipe starts with El Dorado 5-year-old gold rum, which is a solid choice but not integral to the end product. When making the Good Ships / Wood Ships, feel free to use any kind of dark or gold rum, but preferably stick with a rum aged at least five years. What is essential are the other ingredients: Dolin Génépy Des Alpes is an herbal liqueur with strong botanicals and gentle sweetness. It adds significant depth and complexity to the cocktail. It’s balanced by a pink grapefruit liqueur from French brand Giffard, Crème de Pamplemousse Rosé. Sweet and citrusy, it gives the drink a brightness and juiciness befitting a Daiquiri. With the two liqueurs you won’t need much additional sweetener, so the cocktail only calls for a quarter ounce of simple syrup.

Beyond the toys, costumes, books and comics based on the science fiction giant, even bartenders can catch the Star Wars fever, making drinks themed for various Star Wars characters and creatures . One example is bartender Benjamin Schiller’s Sarlacc Pit, named for the sand-dwelling, flesh-eating monster favored by the slug-like Jabba the Hutt in “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.” Schiller created this concoction while working as beverage director at The Sixth Bar in Chicago’s Lincoln Square. Fittingly for a desert planet like Tatooine, the Sarlacc Pit is a Tiki drink, with a blend of El Dorado five-year-old gold rum, ginger syrup, lime juice, bitters and Schiller’s own Han’s Mix, a tweaked version of the Don’s Mix #1 from famed Tiki bartender Donn Beach . For bitters, it calls for both Angostura and Bittermens Elemakule Tiki Bitters . With notes of allspice and cinnamon, the Elemakule Bitters are also important for drinks like the Phoenix Colada and Storm the Beach .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-perfect-storm/,Perfect Storm,Liquor.com,"While there’s no one bartender to credit for the creation of the Perfect Storm, we can safely connect this cocktail to its predecessor, the Dark ’n Stormy . This slightly spicy, slightly sweet rum highball is a consummate summer classic, and is closely related to its vodka equivalent, the Moscow Mule . It’s a straightforward mix of rum (or vodka in the Moscow Mule case), ginger beer and lime juice. This simple template allows plenty of tweaks and variations, as with the Perfect Storm. In this aromatic riff, spiced rum replaces the normal Goslings blackstrap, and adds a layer of warming spices to the classic combination of ginger beer and fresh lime juice. Popular brands include Kraken, Sailor Jerry and Boukman Botanical Rhum, which is made from sugar cane rather than molasses, in the rhum agricole style. Angostura bitters punch up the overall intensity, adding even more aromatics and spice. Of course, with any Dark ’n Stormy variation, a key ingredient is the choice of ginger beer. Fever Tree is usually easy to find and is a reliable standby, beloved by bartenders, but there are plenty of other options these days. If you want to really show off, you can try making your own ginger beer . Like its predecessors, the Perfect Storm is complex and refreshing while still being a breeze to put together.

The Cuba Libre’s creation can be traced to early 1900s Havana, shortly after the Spanish-American War.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/change-in-seasons/,Change in Seasons,Liquor.com,"When he was bar manager at Bar Mash in Charleston, South Carolina, Teddy Nixon wanted to evoke the shifting of the season from summer into fall, especially the iconic view of the changing leaves during a New England autumn. “I also wanted the flavors to change from bright and sunny to a little more earthy and spicy,” he says. “So the drink goes from bright green to a deep red, just like the leaves.” The trick involves some truly unorthodox drink ingredients from the garden and some creative thinking, but produces some stunning effects . The Change in Seasons starts with an ingredient you’re not likely to see at the backbar of your local cocktail lounge: sweet peas. Specifically Very Young Small Sweet Peas from Le Sueur, a brand specializing in canned heritage vegetables. These petite peas add a gentle sweetness as well as an earthy, vegetal note to the drink. There’s no real substitution for them save maybe fresh sweet peas straight from the garden; try using frozen supermarket peas only at your own risk. Ice cubes made with pomegranate, beets and allspice add even more sweetness and earthiness, as well as contribute to the color-changing aspect of the drink as they slowly melt, turning the green drink a vivid violet and red hue. Nixon uses St. Elizabeth allspice dram, a popular and readily available brand—only three ounces of the aromatic liqueur goes into the ice cube mixture, but it’s assertive enough that its flavors come through amongst the beet juice, pomegranate and simple syrup. Tarragon leaves also add to the aromatics, while a blend of rum, lime and sugar bring sweetness and acid. Nixon uses Plantation 3 Star as the base spirit, a lovely clear rum that, while affordable, works beautifully in drinks due to its bright, fruity characteristics and its complexity. The clear properties of the white rum help maintain the clarity of the drink, so substituting it with an aged rum can potentially muddy the colors.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'barspoons', 'ingredient': 'Le Sueur very young small sweet peas'}, {'quantity': '2 1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Plantation 3 Stars rum'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': 'leaves', 'ingredient': 'tarragon'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'small', 'ingredient': 'pomegranate/beet/allspice ice cubes'}]","['Muddle the peas in the bottom of mixing tin, then add the remaining ingredients.', 'Add ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain using a handheld strainer into a short-stemmed glass.', 'Top with flavored ice cubes.']",0,rum

Her take on the Three Dots & a Dash —a WWII-era Tiki classic created by the famed Donn Beach of Don the Beachcomber—swaps out the traditional rum seen in most Tiki drinks for bourbon, specifically Coopers’ Craft bourbon . Allspice dram, golden falernum, Angostura bitters, fresh lime and orange juices and a touch of honey round everything out for a playful and layered drink. If the name of the cocktail sounds familiar, it’s because it’s Morse Code for the letter V, which stands for Victory, specifically referencing the call for the Allied Forces’ victory over the Axis Powers in World War II. Beyond Donn Beach’s cocktail recipe, it also is the name of a famous speakeasy-style Tiki bar in Chicago, also named for the drink. However, its original recipe, like the vast majority of Tiki creations, called for rum. The use of bourbon, in this case Coopers’ Craft, a Kentucky straight bourbon from Brown-Forman, means that the drink leans drier, with more oak and vanilla notes. While it’s a relatively straightforward Tiki drink, it does call for two ingredients you may not have in your home bar: allspice dram and falernum. Griffin uses St. Elizabeth for the allspice, which is the most well-known of allspice dram brands. The dram is used in Tiki drinks to add warmth, spice and baking notes to the often bright and juicy drinks. Similarly, falernum, a ginger syrup, is a widely used Tiki ingredient. Its most well known producer is John D Taylor’s Velvet Falernum, but Griffin uses The Bitter Truth Golden Falernum , a rich and slightly spicy mix of ginger, vanilla, lime and other spices. While not all brands of falernum contain alcohol, the Bitter Truth’s version has 18% alcohol-by-volume, making it a more potent concoction for use in drinks like Three Dots & a Dash. At the bar, this drink gets quickly blended with some ice and then poured over fresh crushed ice in a Tiki mug. If you’re making it at home and don’t have access to a blender, feel free to simply shake it vigorously before straining over crushed ice in whatever vessel best fits it.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'allspice dram'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'falernum'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'blueberries', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'candied ginger', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple wedge', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the bourbon, lime juice, orange juice, honey, allspice dram and falernum to a blender with ice and flash-blend.', 'Strain into a Tiki mug over crushed ice.', 'Garnish with three blueberries and a candied ginger slice, skewered, and a pineapple wedge.', 'Serve with a straw.']",4,bourbon

In an era defined by the Appletini and Cosmopolitan, Abou-Ganim’s innovative drinks helped define San Francisco as a worthy cocktail destination and as a trendsetting locale. At the time of the Cable Car’s creation, Captain Morgan was likely the most available label for spiced rum. While today it’s still the most famous of the category—besides maybe Kraken—the Captain has plenty of competition. Both Cruzan and Bacardi make inexpensive and serviceable spiced rums—neither of them break $15 in most markets but they both work well in cocktails. For a more indulgent approach, Chairman’s Reserve from Saint Lucia, Boukman Botanical Rhum from Haiti and Don Q Oak Barrel Spiced Rum from Puerto Rico are all stellar spiced rums and range from $30 to $50 a bottle. Similar to a Sidecar or Brandy Crusta , the Cable Car includes an orange liqueur in addition to simple syrup for sweetness—specifically, orange curaçao. However, using something like Bol’s will lead to a more cloying drink, and it’s best to instead use a dry curaçao; Abou-Ganim uses Marie Brizard orange curaçao, an elegant blend of bitter oranges from Haiti and sweet-orange zest from Spain. A strong alternative is Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao—crafted in collaboration with cocktail historian David Wondrich, it’s a complex and botanical citrus liqueur macerated with brandy. Other orange liqueurs like Cointreau or Grand Marnier will also make a stunning drink. The presentation of the drink is another aspect that helped cement the Cable Car’s status as a classic. Rather than a more traditional sugared rim, Abou-Ganim uses a mix of sugar and cinnamon, which lends warmth and gentle spice. One alternative is to line half the rim with the mix, so the drinker can select with each sip whether they want the extra sugar or not.","[{'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'ground cinnamon'}, {'quantity': '1/8', 'unit': 'cup', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon wedge'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'spiced rum'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Marie Brizard orange curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange spiral', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Stir together the cinnamon and sugar in a wide-mouthed bowl or on a saucer.', 'Rub the rim of a chilled cocktail glass (or half of the rim) with the lemon wedge and dip the rim in the cinnamon-sugar mixture to coat.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rose-all-day/,Rosé All Day,Liquor.com,"“Rosé all day” is a common rallying cry each summer, when drinkers gravitate toward pink wines and sunny patios. The wine style’s popularity extends beyond Sunday brunch and nautical soirees, however, as it has found its way into cocktails, from the ubiquitous Frosé to more elaborate concoctions. Rosé was once associated with boxed white zinfandel and suffered a poor reputation. Today, good rosés compete with some of the best wines in the world and impart a litany of pleasing characteristics, from fresh flowers and juicy red berries to crisp minerality. Those flavors, plus its spectrum of colors ranging from the palest pink to nearly red, make rosé a versatile weapon in the hands of a skilled bartender. The Rosé All Day cocktail was created by Amanda Jones during her time as the manager of Treadwell Park in New York City. It’s a delicate marriage of rosé, white rum, orange liqueur, rose liqueur, pomegranate liqueur, fresh lemon juice and rhubarb bitters. “We chose to highlight the floral and fruit aspects by adding rose liqueur with rhubarb bitters to balance it out,” she says. “I’m in love with everything floral, and that’s why I like using rosé in cocktails, because it’s the only wine that embodies that to me, and it’s fun to play around with.” With two ounces of rosé leading the way, the cocktail is light and crisp, but the rum and trio of liqueurs lend depth and complexity, plus some added heft to the ABV. Fresh lemon juice ties the room together by tempering the sweet liqueurs, and a slug of club soda provides some welcome dilution and refreshing effervescence. Note that, in this cocktail, the rosé is a still wine rather than a sparkling variety. Sparkling rosés are great additions to cocktails, but given their bubbly nature they are typically employed as toppers and not shaken in tins like you see in this recipe. Most recipes avoid shaking any carbonated liquid in a tin, as the pressure can make the tins lose their connection, separate, and cover you or your guest in the drink. 7 Rosé Cocktails You Absolutely Need to Try This Summer RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rosé wine'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'rose liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'pomegranate liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Club soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rosé, white rum, orange liqueur, rose liqueur, pomegranate liqueur, lemon juice and rhubarb bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a 13-ounce wine glass.', 'Add ice and top with the club soda.', 'Garnish with an orange twist.']",9,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/phoenix-colada/,Phoenix Colada,Liquor.com,"The Dark ’n Stormy trifecta of dark rum, ginger beer and lime juice is icy, spicy perfection. But like many other drinks, it’s also a potential playground for experimentation , with bartenders switching up ingredients and playing with bitters, infusions, fruit juice or even other base spirits. The Phoenix Colada, from Matt Giarratano, pushes the concept of what defines a Dark ’n Stormy, with the addition of bourbon as well as pineapple juice and a coconut infusion. Giarratano, the bar director at Bluebird Distilling in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, wanted to remove the endless sun-and-beach associations of his favorite tropical flavors—rum, coconut and pineapple—and add an element of what he calls everyday drinkability. “Introducing dryness through the bitters and ginger beer creates a balance that brings an everyday familiarity to the tropicality of the drink—something of an urban Tiki vibe,” he says. To that end he infuses rum with coconut, adds pineapple juice to the mix and spikes it with Tiki bitters and spicy ginger beer. The name Phoenix Colada is an homage to the Pennsylvania town near Philadelphia where the distillery and its cocktail bar are located. And while officially a Dark ’n Stormy can only be called that if it’s made with Goslings Black Seal rum, Giarratano uses Bluebird Distilling’s own product—which he infuses with coconut—for his drink. If you’re recreating the Phoenix Colada at home and can’t find Bluebird’s rum, using another white, sugarcane-based rum like a rhum agricole would work best. Similarly Giarratano uses the distillery’s own Four Grain bourbon, and again you can substitute with another whiskey if you’re not in the Philadelphia area. The flavor is particular, but you’ll get closest with a high-rye bourbon, as the Four Grain has a prominent rye profile. Finally, the drink is topped with Gosling’s ginger beer, which helps pull it back into the Dark ’n Stormy fold. The pineapple fronds add tropical imagery, but they’re not critical to the quality of the drink. 5 Recipe Variations Every Dark ’n Stormy Lover Should Know FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'bourbon'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'pineapple juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'demerara syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'pineapple fronds'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the rum, bourbon, pineapple juice, demerara syrup and Tiki bitters into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the ginger beer.', 'Garnish with 2 pineapple fronds and freshly grated nutmeg.']",0,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/creole-crusta/,Creole Crusta,Liquor.com,"A Crusta is a unique category of drink , one that arose in the 19th Century, likely in New Orleans. They combine a spirit (commonly and most famously brandy), orange liqueur, lemon juice and bitters, which is essentially the same recipe as a sour, like a Margarita or Sidecar . And as much as the recipe is important to the category, so too is its presentation: in order to be considered a Crusta, the drink must be served in a taller, narrow glass with a sugared rim and a large citrus peel curled in the mouth of the glass. The Creole Crusta, from veteran bartender and bar-owner Alba Huerta, taps into the story of the American South, including the dark history of slavery and plantations. Rather than the more familiar brandy, the base of the Creole Crusta is Demerara rum, which is strictly the rums produced in Guyana (it’s named for a major river that flows through the South American country, not the sugar). In her cocktail book “Julep”—which reexamines and reimagines classic Southern cocktails—Huerta writes that the use of rum was important to the drink, as it was a major aspect of the slave trade in the Americas, with plantation workers often being trafficked from Africa to farm sugar cane. Huerta also gives the drink a toasted benne seed rim as homage to the benne seeds that slaves brought over from Africa, one of the items they were able to cultivate in subsistence gardens. She clarifies that Ansel Mills is the only producer of authentic benne seeds in the United States—however, you can substitute toasted sesame seeds, if needed or desired.","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Toasted and cooled benne seeds'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Turbinado sugar'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Demerara rum'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Clement Créole Shrubb orange liqueur'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'turbinado sugar syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Bittercube Bolivar bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Mix together the turbinado sugar and toasted benne seeds.', 'Coat the rim of a cocktail glass with lemon juice, and coat it in the sugar and seed mixture.', 'Add the Demerara rum, Clement Créole Shrubb orange liqueur, lemon juice, Turbinado sugar syrup and Bittercube Bolivar bitters to a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into the rimmed cocktail glass, and garnish with an orange peel.']",0,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/high-horse/,High Horse,Liquor.com,"The United States is best known for its whiskey production, particularly bourbon, but the country’s history is soaked in brandy and rum. Brandy came over with European immigrants, and grapes were planted on both coasts to sate thirsts. Rum originated among enslaved people in the Caribbean, but the British colonization of that region brought the spirit to New England in the 17th century. There, it became very popular among colonists, who eventually decided to make their own. By 1757, rum was the most popular beverage in the American colonies, with the average person consuming a staggering 3.7 gallons per year. Shannon Tebay Sidle, a bartender at New York’s Death & Co , created the High Horse cocktail in a nod to colonial-era ingredients. She merges aged rum with a double dose of cherry, plus sweet vermouth and Angostura bitters. Kirschwasser, or kirsch, is a clear, somewhat bitter brandy distilled from sour Morello cherries and their stones. Cherry liqueur adds a kick of cherry sweetness. “When I thought of George Washington and colonial flavor associations, my mind immediately went to the proverbial cherry tree,” she says. “The name was inspired not only by the many classical equine portraits of the nation’s first president but also the popular myth that the young George could not tell a lie.” The High Horse combines Washington’s legendary cherry association with his known fondness for rum and other spirits (after his presidency, Washington’s Mount Vernon estate was the nation’s most prolific spirits producer.)

But at Brooklyn’s Fort Defiance , head bartender Zac Overman, now the owner of Seattle’s L’Oursin , put them front and center in his Piña Colada riff. In 2014, Overman started hosting a weekly Tiki night at Fort Defiance called the Sunken Harbor Club, which has since morphed into a tropical bar of the same name above Downtown Brooklyn’s Gage & Tollner restaurant. In creating this drink for that series of events, he found inspiration in Giuseppe González’s Trinidad Sour , which calls for a previously inconceivable ounce and a half of Angostura bitters. He employs an equally huge quantity of the ingredient more typically measured in dashes in his Colada twist. “The Trinidad Sour is 100% the reason this drink exists,” says Overman. “Nobody thought to use bitters as a base spirit before.” The Piña Colada might not be a true Tiki cocktail, but its tropical nature made Overman’s drink right at home alongside his takes on Tiki classics like the White Zombie at his Sunken Harbor Club pop-up. “Ango has all of the warm baking-spice notes that so many Tiki drinks evoke, taken to the nth degree,” he says. “I think of it as a supercharged over-spiced rum in this cocktail.” The bitters that form this drink’s base have an alcohol content similar to that of most spirits, about 45% ABV, and Overman adds a half-ounce of Smith & Cross rum for additional aromatics. If you don’t have that specific brand on hand, opt for a strong and funky pot-still rum that can stand up to the Angostura’s intensity; he also recommends the Younger bottling from Hampden Estate, another Jamaican producer. “As long as the bottle you choose makes you pull the gas face, it will work,” he quips. The one non-negotiable, according to Overman: the drink’s namesake bitters. “I tried this with Peychaud’s at some point, but it was gross,” he says. “No offense to Peychaud’s! It just didn't work.” Just as the Sunken Harbor Club has evolved beyond a weekly pop-up into a brick-and-mortar bar, the Angostura Colada has cemented its status as a modern classic. A version has landed on the menu of the Brooklyn hotspot, where it has been upgraded with a housemade coconut cream, an acid-adjusted pineapple juice, and a flash blend, but the recipe below hews closely to the original.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/rum-tonic/,Rum & Tonic,Liquor.com,"Rum is a versatile spirit that can be sipped on its own or mixed into cocktails. If you’re trying to keep the approach simple, it works well with mixers like cola and ginger beer, as evidenced by classic calls like the Cuba Libre and Dark ’n Stormy . But all too often, tonic is overlooked as a complement to rum , and that deserves correction. The bitter quinine in tonic can foil the molasses-based (or sugarcane-based) spirit’s sweetness, while the soda’s botanicals are a flavor match for the layered richness of aged expressions. So, regardless which style of rum you’re working with, tonic has the chops to match. ""I love a Rum & Tonic during the summer,” says Ashwin Vilkhu, the co-owner of Saffron in New Orleans. “It’s a great alternative to a G&T because it’s light and refreshing while having depth of flavor.” Vilkhu employs two rums for the base of the cocktail, and surprisingly, neither are from the Caribbean or South America. Instead he uses Paranubes, a sugarcane-based rum from Oaxaca, Mexico, and Old Port East Indian, a rich, molasses-forward rum. Since neither are as ubiquitous as rums like Bacardi, Flor de Caña or Plantation, you might be forced to make substitutions. A rhum agricole or other sugarcane-based rum will fill in best for the Paranubes, while another dark, butterscotch-forward rum can take the place of the Old Port East Indian. Vilkhu serves his Rum & Tonic Spanish-style, in a large goblet heavily garnished with a lot of ingredients. More than just for visual show, the garnishes—which include star anise, cinnamon and citrus—have aromas and flavors that either complement or coax out those in the rum.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/1792-kentucky-white-dog-julep/,1792 Kentucky White Dog Julep,David Wondrich,"On June 1, 1792, the western half of the Commonwealth of Virginia was split off and admitted to the Union as the 15th state. Since that event, the Commonwealth of Kentucky has made many fine contributions to American culture, but perhaps none as important as bourbon whiskey. Nowadays, of course, when it comes to drinking, Kentucky is synonymous with bourbon. Interestingly enough, the same thing was true in 1792. Not that the new state had anything like what we would consider an industry—there were no real brands as we know them currently. Rather, every farmer who could afford to maintained his own copper pot still, worm tub and set of mash tuns, and the ones who couldn’t had their grain distilled for them. All that was good business: Kentucky was the frontier, and distilling not only made grain more valuable but also reduced its volume by two-thirds and rendered it unlikely to spoil. Not that the Kentucks, as the pioneers were known, didn’t do a little drinking. For the most part, that meant hoisting a jug of whiskey (or peach brandy, apple brandy or applejack —the state was also famous for those spirits) and letting the contents trickle down their throats. But there were such things as mixed drinks back then as well. The first mention of a proper Mint Julep comes from Norfolk, Virginia, in 1793; we can safely assume that the same concoction was consumed in the former western half of the state, too. That version involved rum, but in the West, it would have been whiskey or fruit brandy instead. It would have been rather different than the modern recipe, though, and not just because ice was uncommon. American distillers didn’t learn about the benefits of storing their product in charred-oak casks for another generation, so that whiskey would have been unaged (and very strong). To taste a White Dog Julep is to appreciate the genius of American mixology, and, thanks to the recent rise in small-scale distilling, such liquor is no longer hard to find. Neither is ice, so be sure to throw some of that in, too, because you can. 5 Unaged Whiskeys You Should Try RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'water'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'teaspoons', 'ingredient': 'granulated sugar'}, {'quantity': '6', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprigs', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the sugar and water to a highball glass, and stir until the sugar has completely dissolved.', 'Add the mint leaves and press lightly with a muddler.', 'Pack the glass with finely cracked ice, and then add the whiskey.', 'Stir, add more ice to make up for any shrinkage, and garnish with two or three sprigs of mint and a straw.']",0,whiskey

The spirit often mirrors scotch in its production method, and the best examples rival the best scotches and deserve to be sipped neat. But given Japan’s impressive cocktail culture, it’s no surprise that whiskey often finds its way into cocktails, both elaborate and simple, like the Highball Mizuwari. Mizuwari translates to “cut with water” and describes a traditional way of drinking whiskey in Japan, where Highballs are prolific. Adding sparkling water to whiskey lets you taste the flavors without consuming it straight. As with most Highballs, the quality of the ice used and the temperature of the glass, whiskey and water are essential for optimizing the cocktail. But this ritual is more involved than combining the two liquids. The Highball Mizuwari demands perfect technique and attention to detail in order to boost the flavors and the effervescence, rendering this simple drink so satisfying. The whiskey and ice must be stirred 13 and a half times (yes, exactly 13 and a half). After adding the water, you stir it another three and a half times. That’s 17 total stirs, for those who lost count.

Manhattans that switch the amounts of whiskey and vermouth flaunt all of the flavor without the heady proof. And the Reverse Manhattan itself is nothing new: 19th-century cocktail lovers would likely have just called it a Manhattan, as cocktail historians say vermouth was featured more prominently in drinks back then, including in the whiskey classic. Today, the Reverse Manhattan is a bartender favorite and a formula ripe for experimentation. You can infuse your spirit component, swap amaro for vermouth or dose your cocktail with a liqueur to upend the familiar flavor profile. Max Green created this reverse Manhattan when he was the head bartender at New York City’s famed Amor y Amargo so guests at the weekly three-cocktail event the bar hosted at the time, called Two Weeks Notice, could leave happily buzzed, not boozed. “Flipping that vermouth-and-whiskey ratio can really save you,” he says. Sancho-pepper-infused whiskey adds spice and bright citrus notes that are pulled together by lime bitters. Normally with a Manhattan, the vermouth is up to the maker’s choice. But in the Diamond District, it’s important to stick with the specified Carpano Antica Formula—this rich, botanical and nuanced vermouth defines the flavor profile of the drink, and while there are plenty of quality vermouths out there, the pairing in this was particular. Similarly, the lime bitters should not be substituted, as they bring a brightness to the otherwise very rich drink and pair nicely with the peppers in the infused rye whiskey. 5 Modern Takes on the Reverse Manhattan FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Carpano Antica Formula vermouth'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sancho pepper-infused Wild Turkey 101 rye whiskey'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'Scrappy’s lime bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Carpano Antica Formula vermouth, sancho-pepper infused rye whiskey and Scrappy’s lime bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",8,whiskey
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/el-guapo/,El Guapo,Alex Frane,"The Box Social in Portland, Oregon, is a moody and romantic bar, popular for date nights and celebratory evenings. Its signature cocktail, El Guapo, is one such reason for the bar’s longevity, as guests have been coming in for it since the original bar manager, Michael Rowe, put it on the menu in 2011. It’s vividly rosy with a puree of passion fruit, blood orange and pomegranate, and makes for a conversation piece due to its unconventional garnish. Loosely translated as “The Handsome,” the drink closely resembles a fruity take on a Margarita . Its base is blanco tequila (the Box Social uses Libélula brand), but it also gets simple syrup and lime juice. However, the big difference is the inclusion of fruit puree. The bar uses El Corazon—a blend of pomegranate, passion fruit and blood orange—from The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley, a brand specializing in fruit purees for drinks and smoothies. It adds a vivid pink hue to the drink as well as layered and complex fruit notes. Unfortunately, there’s not a good substitute for it that’s easily made in a home bar, so if you’re serious about making El Guapo, you’ll need to order the ingredient online. While tequila is the base of the drink, it also gets mezcal , albeit in an untraditional manner. When the drink was originally added to the menu, customers were still relatively unused to seeing (and tasting) mezcal in their drinks. Keeping it separate from the drink in an inverted lime shell—a “lime boat,” as it was referred to—allowed diners to taste it on its own or add it to the drink. These days, the bar serves the mezcal in a shot glass secured to the cocktail glass with a clothespin, but there’s still something fun about using a lime boat to hold the liquor. Del Maguey Vida is a popular choice for the mezcal (and what the bar uses), but you can also use something like Banhez or Union Mezcal. 11 Margarita Variations to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'The Perfect Purée of Napa Valley El Corazon fruit puree'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Del Maguey Vida mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime'}]","['Rim a highball glass with salt and pepper and set aside.', 'Add the blanco tequila, El Corazon puree, simple syrup and lime juice into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into the prepared highball glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with an inverted 1/2 lime with the juice squeezed out (a lime boat).', 'Fill the lime boat with the mezcal.']",6,tequila

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/volunteer/,Volunteer,Liquor.com,"The Volunteer is a fun tweak on the Margarita with a bounty of garden ingredients added to the mix. The drink comes from Snackbar in Oxford, Mississippi, a Southern bistro and oyster bar; it cleanses the palate and complements dishes with its blanco tequila and Cointreau base enlivened with fresh botanicals. The drink starts by muddling fresh melon with cucumber, jalapeño, cilantro and lime juice with grapefruit bitters and agave syrup. This fresh and juicy mix creates a bright and complex base, but not everyone is a fan of jalapeño or cilantro in their Margarita. Luckily, you can omit one or both of these ingredients without disrupting the balance of the drink. When it comes to the melon, it’s up to whatever varieties are in season and which you most prefer, but honeydew and cantaloupe work best. Watermelon, unless it’s especially ripe, may be too mild to stand up to the other ingredients. At Snackbar, the Volunteer has Cuestión blanco tequila as its primary spirit. Like with most tequila drinks, that can be swapped for another quality tequila brand; just be sure to only use blanco tequila or risk muddying the clarity of the drink. Similarly, while Cointreau is a top brand for orange liqueur, using another good triple sec is acceptable.

With multiple trilogies and additional standalone releases keeping fans’ interest over the years, it’s only natural that a few decades’ worth of passionate support eventually resulted in themed cocktails paying homage to the cultural classic. The Valley of the Dark Lords is an original recipe from Sol Trece, general manager of La Cuevita , an agave-focused bar in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. One part Blood & Sand , one part terrarium, it’s a terrestrial textural treat. While the Blood and Sand features scotch, Herring cherry liqueur, sweet vermouth and orange juice, the Valley of the Dark Lords begins with earthy, savory mezcal. It keeps the cherry liqueur and orange juice, but skips vermouth in favor of Ancho Reyes, an ancho chile liqueur. That combination produces a spicy and citrusy drink with notes of roasted agave and mild smoke. Stop there, and you have a tasty cocktail, but Trece applies turmeric and chia seeds to take this drink somewhere intergalactic. “We wanted a cocktail that, if you were looking through a telescope from another planet, you would see sand and living creatures,” says Trece. “We added turmeric for sand color and texture and chia seeds for the ‘creatures’ effect.” Make the Valley of the Dark Lords the next time you sit down to watch “Star Wars”—or whenever you’re paying tribute to the Sith.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/broncos-sunset/,Broncos Sunset,Alex Frane,"Inspiration for cocktail invention can come from anywhere. Sometimes it’s an homage to a piece of literature, like James Bond’s Vesper . The classic Adonis cocktail was inspired by a Broadway play of the same name, while Star Wars has inspired numerous drinks . On the other side of the spectrum, bartenders have been influenced by their home football teams: Bryan Dayton, the beverage director and co-owner of Denver’s Brider and Boulder’s Oak at Fourteenth , developed this slightly spicy tequila drink in homage to both Denver and its football team. An unconventionally layered drink, the Broncos Sunset evokes the twilight sky over Colorado, as well as the team’s uniforms. “Denver is known for these amazing orange-hued sunsets, so I wanted to incorporate that into this cocktail,” Dayton says. “Obviously, the orange and blue is also a nod to the Broncos jersey.” Liquor floats are not an uncommon way to finish a drink, including those made to honor football teams, like the Autumn Wind for the Raiders. However, in order to get the image of a sunset into a glass, Dayton flips the formula upside down, starting with a sunken layer of blue curaçao to mimic the thin ribbon of blue sky beneath the red-orange sunset of tequila and Italian bitter liqueurs. Because of this, it’s important to pour the drink slowly and carefully into the crushed ice, so it settles easily on top. Autumn Wind 2 ratings The bulk of the drink is a heady mixture of tequila, spicy Ancho Reyes liqueur, two kinds of Italian bittersweet liqueur and two kinds of citrus juice. Dayton uses Suerte tequila, which is made in Mexico but locally owned. “In terms of the ingredients, I wanted to stick to local Colorado, so I used Suerte tequila, which is based here in Boulder,” he says. “We also love spicy food here, so I added the Ancho Reyes for some heat.” Along with the spicy liqueur and tequila, Dayon mixes in equal parts Aperol and Campari , the legendary pair of Italian bittersweet liqueurs. Along with their complex flavors, the two add a crimson hue to the drink. Mixed with orange and lemon juice, they mellow to a vivid orange. Simple syrup balances the tartness of the Broncos Sunset, but it’s best to allow the blue curaçao to slowly incorporate, adding its own sweetness and citrus notes to the drink. Of course, the Broncos Sunset is best enjoyed while watching the team play on a big-screen television, especially at dusk in Colorado, but there’s no bad time to enjoy this unconventional tequila drink.","[{'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blue curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Suerte silver tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Ancho Reyes chile liqueur'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Aperol'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Garnish: blood orange', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the blue curaçao to the bottom of a rocks glass and top with crushed ice.', 'Add the silver tequila, Ancho Reyes liqueur, Aperol, Campari, orange juice, lemon juice and simple syrup into a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into the glass over the crushed ice (adding more if necessary), and garnish with a blood orange slice.']",14,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sour-t-iesel/,Sour T-iesel,Liquor.com,"Cocktail trends ebb and flow , with new ingredients coming into popularity and old ones being rediscovered. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, one ingredient that began cropping up on cocktail bar menus was CBD. The abbreviation stands for cannabidiol, one of the active ingredients in cannabis, the other being tetrahydrocannabinol, more popularly known as THC. Unlike THC, CBD doesn’t get a person “high,” and is legal in many states, as well as at the federal level (though some states do have regulations against its sales). With loosening restrictions nationwide on cannabis in general, CBD has become a hot ingredient . While little research has shown evidence for strong physiological effects from CBD, many proponents of it tout CBD’s use as a pain reliever and anxiety-reducer. Generally, when added to cocktails or non-alcoholic drinks, its oils are used; in addition to the potential physical effects, it also imparts a subtle flavor and mouthfeel. That’s what Jason Eisner at Gracias Madre in California uses in the Sour T-iesel, along with tequila, lime, and agave nectar. This minty tequila sour has a few other variants from the normal. Rather than opting for egg whites to add a silky mouthfeel and layer of foam, Eisner uses aquafaba, which is the liquid leftover from canned chickpeas. Aquafaba is a popular vegan alternative to egg whites as it replicates the same foaminess, albeit with a bit more work generally. In this recipe, Eisner uses an emulsifier, though a dry shake (without ice) before shaking with ice can work as well. To add complexity as well as a cheeky detail about the ingredients, Eisner also stencils a matcha cannabis leaf on top of the foam. He uses a ceremonial-grade matcha, which is the kind used to make tea, rather than a culinary-grade matcha which is more often used for things like matcha lattes. It will definitely impart a bright, grassy and vegetal flavor to the drink, so exercise caution when applying.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tequila'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'agave nectar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'pinch', 'ingredient': 'sea salt'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'tbsp', 'ingredient': 'mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '5', 'unit': 'drops', 'ingredient': 'cold-pressed CBD oil (extracted from industrial hemp)'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'aquafaba'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tsp', 'ingredient': 'matcha'}]","['Place all of the ingredients except for the CBD oil and aquafaba in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake vigorously.', 'Fine-strain into a 64 ounce container, and add the CBD oil and aquafaba.

More magic occurs when the flowers meet with an acidic ingredient, changing the liquid to purple or bright pink when high pH is present like in citrus or tonic.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/sunday-flip/,Sunday Flip,Liquor.com,"Egg whites in cocktails are practically commonplace at this point; many bars make their Whiskey Sours with them, and they’re a requirement for drinks like the Gin Fizz . Whole eggs, yolk and all, are not quite as popular a drink ingredient, but there is a strong revival of the category of drinks known as a “flip,” whose defining trait is using a whole egg. One such example is the Sunday Flip from Nashville bartender Jon Howard, who designed the drink while working as the head bartender at Henley. This low-alcohol drink is vermouth-based, and its creaminess as well as its strawberry and vermouth flavors make it a perfect after-dinner libation. The Sunday Flip was born from Howard’s childhood nostalgia—he remembers enjoying strawberry shortcake on summer Sundays growing up, and even though he admits most of the ingredients were store-bought, it was always the highlight of the week (and his grandfather’s favorite dessert). He wanted the Sunday Flip to be a liquid manifestation of this nostalgic treat—rather than a spirit like brandy or rum, he instead uses a bianco vermouth from Carpano, giving it a much lower alcohol content than many flips. For the strawberry flavor that’s crucial for the strawberry shortcake vibes, Howard uses a strawberry vinegar, which also adds a tartness and depth, more so than a strawberry syrup would. It plays well with the vermouth and creates a more nuanced drink. Because of its natural tartness, Howard doesn’t add lemon juice; in an unconventional move, he instead shakes the drink with a large peel of lemon, adding its natural citrus oils to the drink rather than its juices. Simple syrup then balances the drink with its sweetness. Like any drink with an egg, especially a whole one, you’ll want to give this a good dry shake before adding the ice and shaking again. This helps to emulsify the egg and to give the Sunday Flip a good, thick foam head and a creamy mouthfeel.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/chairmans-refresher/,Chairman’s Refresher,Liquor.com,"Frangelico is a bit divisive in the bartending world; this hazelnut-based liqueur is often relegated to overly sweet dessert cocktails—look for it in drinks like the Mint Chocolate Chip Shot and the creamy Toblerone —and is even used for topping ice cream and other desserts. But bar founder and author Jim Meehan found a use for it in the Chairman’s Refresher, a silky and (appropriately) refreshing cocktail that celebrates both Frangelico and Banks 5 Island rum, from which it gets its name. “I always liked Frangelico, even before I moved to hazelnut country,” Meehan says, speaking of his move to Portland, Oregon. He had used the ingredient in cocktails at his previous bar in New York, the famed PDT, and considers it a natural accompaniment to the bright and refreshing quality of coconut water and muddled cucumber. “The combination of hazelnut, coconut and cucumber is magical,” he says. When making the Chairman’s Refresher, the brand of white rum used is essential, as Meehan built the drink around Banks 5-Island rum, a blend of 20 different rums from across the Caribbean. It can be a little on the pricey side, and not available in every market, but its flavor profile is crucial to the quality of the final product. “Banks’ savory, pungent aromatics take it all to another level,” Meehan says. Even the name comes from Banks Rum, as Meehan describes the chairman of the company’s propensity for sipping white rum with coconut water. If you do go for a bottle of the rum and don’t enjoy it in the Chairman’s Refresher, it’s also essential for another Meehan creation, the Kew Garden . Bright and crisp with a vegetal kick from the cucumber and nutty sweetness from the Frangelico, the Chairman’s Refresher is intended to be enjoyed in the warmer months, preferably on a patio or in a garden.

The idea is to have the vinegar create a really pungent garnish, kind of like a pickled onion on a Martini. Fresh berries will lack that zing, so I’d definitely suggest pickling them or even just soaking them overnight in Champagne vinegar to at least get some of that flavor.” (As for the name, in 1958, the Lions traded quarterback Bobby Layne to the Pittsburgh Steelers. Layne, in response, supposedly said the Lions would not win for 50 years—though this statement has been disputed as a hoax and was never published at the time.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/manu-de-chango/,Manu de Chango,Liquor.com,"As delicious as cocktails are to drink, it’s an unfortunate reality that making cocktails creates waste. After a night at a busy bar, all the juiced citrus husks, leftover fruit pulp and herb stems can really add up, so enterprising bartenders have been finding creative ways to repurpose ingredients that are ordinarily thrown away. Kim Stodel, the bar director at Providence in Los Angeles, has been integral in reducing waste at the bar. One example can be found in her Manu de Chango cocktail, which is like a cross between a Margarita and a Paloma . It’s made with tequila, dry curaçao, guava, lime juice and grapefruit juice. Stodel chooses Angelisco blanco tequila, a single-estate tequila that’s produced in the highlands of Jalisco. But if you’re unable to source this brand, another high-quality blanco will get the job done. To get the most out of the ingredients, Stodel eschews bottled guava and instead makes her own guava syrup—a process that results in a lot of guava pulp. Rather than throwing all that pulp away, she finds a use for it, making it into a fruit leather garnish to put the finishing touch on the drink. The fruit leather is surprisingly easy to make, and it not only provides a good garnish for the cocktail, but it also makes a tasty snack. 4 Eco-Friendly Cocktails to Try Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Angelisco blanco tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Pierre Ferrand dry curaçao'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'guava syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'guava fruit leather', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all the ingredients into a shaker with ice.', 'Shake until well-chilled, and double-strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Garnish with guava fruit leather.']",0,tequila

The Sazerac is a classic whiskey cocktail that hails from New Orleans and was first stirred to life in the 1800s. And the Bonpland is a modern play on both. The Bonpland comes from Jules Elkovich, a sommelier at Michael Jordan’s Steak House at Mohegan Sun Casino & Resort in Uncasville, Connecticut. The drink is an homage to Aimé Bonpland, the French botanist who explored Mexico between 1799 and 1805 with Alexander von Humboldt and who created the country’s first maps. “Most people feel that green Chartreuse is too harsh, too astringent, too medicinal,” says Elkovich. That’s usually because they were given a shot at room temperature, which can exacerbate the boozy liqueur’s alcohol content and botanical punch. “Hiding behind that signature licorice bite is a backbone of green pepper, baking spices, rosemary and lavender,” she says. When it’s chilled with ice and stirred or shaken with other ingredients, the liqueur’s sharp notes evolve into citrus and fresh garden herbs all while keeping that peppery structure. The Bonpland takes the green Chartreuse and lime juice traits of the Last Word and merges them with the sugar cube and rinsed glass of the Sazerac to create a cocktail that highlights the best of both drinks. “Reposado tequila has the perfect marriage of spice, baking spice, green grass and fresh herbaceous notes that play so well with green Chartreuse,” she says. “And the name seemed an appropriate hat tip to the marriage of Mexican and French influences.” What the #$@!

In addition to Carnival and a steady supply of world-class soccer players, the South American country is responsible for cachaça, a rum-like spirit that is distilled from the fermented juice of sugar cane. Cachaça is best known for its place in the classic Caipirinha , but this is no one-trick liquor. It can be utilized in a variety of drinks, including the Cherry Bomb, a recipe from New York drinks consultant Aisha Sharpe. The Cherry Bomb cocktail combines cachaça with cherry liqueur, fresh lime juice and club soda for a bubbly refreshment. The dry, grassy cachaça complements the sweet cherry liqueur and tart lime, while the sparkling water imbues the drink with welcome effervescence. The cocktail is similar to a classic daisy , a drink template featuring a spirit, citrus, orange liqueur and soda water. In this case, the orange liqueur is replaced by cherry liqueur, but the core tenets remain. The drink is flavorful and balanced, finding just enough sweetness from the liqueur (rather than sugar or simple syrup) to enhance the other ingredients. You have options with that cherry liqueur. Bottles vary but most are made from neutral grain spirits or brandy. Some feature the sweet flavor of cherry flesh, while others opt for the bittersweet flavors of cherry pits.

It doesn’t take much to make a great Cobbler: Throw some sherry, sugar and a little fruit into a shaker, then give it all a vigorous shake. Pour over crushed ice, apply a garnish of your choosing, and bask in the refreshment. Nearly two centuries since its advent, the Sherry Cobbler is still as good as ever. But today, it’s common for barkeeps to add flavorful flair to their drinks using liqueurs, vermouths and shrubs. Take the Gage Cobbler, for example, which adds Chambord. “Chambord works well with sherry and crushed ice to make a sweeter version of the classic Cobbler,” says bartender Azrhiel Frost. Its high sugar content is best balanced by dry or acidic ingredients, she adds. These can include citrus, bitter liqueurs or dry sherry, like she uses in this variation, which she created while working at The Gage in Chicago. The Gage Cobbler is simple and refreshing, but it tastes more complex than its ingredients might suggest, and the ingredients give robustness to this easy-sipping cocktail. The Chambord’s sweetness is offset by the light and dry fino sherry and the tart lemon juice.

The Kyoto Sour comes from drinks consultant, author and sake enthusiast Paul Tanguay.

The sake is herbaceous, with hints of pear and apple, good acidity and a medium-dry finish. It merges seamlessly with the lemon juice in the cocktail, while agave nectar adds a touch of sweetness.

Composed of just three ingredients—cachaça (Brazil’s national spirit), fresh limes and sugar—it’s a cultural institution throughout the South American country and one of its most popular exports. First made in the 1500s, cachaça is similar to rum, but with a unique flavor all its own. Rather than being distilled from molasses, it’s made from fermented sugar cane juice. This important difference yields a bold spirit that is characterized by its funky, grassy flavors, which stand out when mixed into drinks like the Honey Kumquat Caipirinha. This aptly named cocktail comes from H. Joseph Ehrmann, the proprietor of Elixir in San Francisco. It features fresh kumquats, in addition to lime, and is sweetened with honey and falernum (a Caribbean liqueur with flavors of lime, ginger, almonds and spice) rather than the traditional sugar. The result is recognizable as a Caipirinha, but the honey-falernum combination creates a richer flavor profile than the classic, and the kumquats lend their trademark citrusy notes.

First made in the 1500s, cachaça is similar to rum, but with a unique flavor that’s all its own. Rather than being distilled from molasses, it’s made from fermented sugar cane juice.

Combining multiple spirit categories in the same drink, however, takes an especially deft hand. Bartending pro Jillian Vose of The Dead Rabbit in New York City is up to the task, merging two Irish whiskeys with two brandies for the Commander in Chief cocktail. Vose knows a thing or two about Irish whiskey , so that’s where she begins. Green Spot is composed of single pot still whiskeys aged between seven and 10 years, and it’s full of aromatic spices, barley, toasted oak and green apple. Redbreast 12-year-old, which is triple-distilled and then matured in bourbon and sherry casks, lends spicy, fruity and toasty notes. The whiskeys are joined by Lemorton Pommeau de Normandie brandy (apple and pear with a touch of spice) and a small measure of Giffard apricot brandy (rich fruit with almond accents), which bring extra body and flavor to the cocktail. Mix these spirits with verjus blanc—the tart, fresh juice of unripe wine grapes—plus passion fruit syrup and bitters to round everything out, and you get a complex cocktail that’s loaded with fruit, spice and oak. The Commander in Chief is more complicated than your average whiskey drink, but you don’t need to concoct any esoteric syrups or intricate infusions; each ingredient is available at liquor stores or online, which means that only a little shopping is standing between you and a drink from a bar that has twice been named the best in the world. 20 Irish Whiskey Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'whiskey'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'apricot brandy'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Fusion Verjus Blanc'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'teaspoon', 'ingredient': 'passion fruit syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Green Spot, Redbreast, Lemorton Pommeau de Normandie brandy, apricot brandy, verjus blanc, passion fruit syrup and bitters into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Nick & Nora glass.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",10,whiskey

To double down on the flavors, Gamboa includes some fresh grapefruit juice, as well as a rosemary sprig for garnish, and for sweetness he adds elderflower liqueur, whose floral qualities marry well with the citrus and herbs. A little simple syrup and some lemon juice balance the flavors. One area in which vodka as a spirit category excels is infusions—this is due to vodka’s relatively neutral flavor profile, allowing the infused elements to come through clean and clear. And while it’s possible to simply add whatever ingredients you like to a high-proof vodka (or even Everclear) and let it sit for a week, sometimes you don’t have the time. One popular solution is to use a kitchen device for sous vide cooking . Gamboa uses Mason jars for his sous vide infusions. He recommends that newbies bring the jars to temperature slowly, warming them with the water bath. He has yet to meet an ingredient he hasn’t been able to sous vide, he says, and he suggests picking up a copy of “ The Flavor Bible ,” by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg for infusion inspiration.

With more vodkas on the market than you can count, and increasingly more well-made tonics, crafting the perfect Vodka Tonic is a personal exercise. Vodka is known as a neutral spirit, but bottles vary by raw ingredient, geography and distillation method, so choose one you enjoy drinking neat. Then apply the same care to the tonic. The carbonated mixer gets its bitter taste from quinine, a substance that was originally used to treat malaria. Combine with some sugar, and you get the delicious beverage we know today.

You’ve got options, so decide whether you want the tonic to play a subtle role in support of the vodka or to stand on its own.

Its refreshing, zesty profile makes it a pleasing summer quaff, but its gingery, boozy spice makes it just as pleasant in the winter. However, this version from the luxe Triple Creek Ranch , located in Darby’s Bitterroot Mountain Range of the Montana Rockies, is a decidedly autumnal take. “The combination of pear vodka, warm cinnamon and spicy ginger beer is the perfect way to spice up a chilly holiday night in the mountains of Montana,” head bartender Patty Pyles says of the The Kickin’ Mule. In the Kickin’ Mule, Grey Goose La Poire—a fine French vodka flavored with Anjou pear—is mixed with fresh-pressed apple cider, a homemade smoked cinnamon syrup, lemon juice, ginger beer and Bitter Truth pimento dram , a Jamaican rum-based allspice liqueur. “The pear and cinnamon are a classic flavor combination, while the ginger beer gives it that spicy kick, hence the name,” says Pyles. The smoked cinnamon syrup adds another dimension to the drink, but you should feel free to substitute it with regular simple syrup and a dash of cinnamon, if desired. Fever Tree is the brand of ginger beer that Pyles uses for the drink. A label well-regarded for its fresh, spicy take on a naturally fermented ginger beer, the brand is available in most markets. But it can also be substituted with a product like Q Ginger Beer or Fentimans . And if you want to go really all out, you can always try your hand at making your own ginger beer .

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/chai-spice-mule/,Chai Spice Mule,Liquor.com,"Inspired by the comforting flavors in chai, this vodka drink was created to pair with the roller coaster ride that is fall in Virginia. “...warming, comforting, autumnal spices but also zesty ginger beer and refreshing flavors,” Nikki Drake, the bar director at 2941 Restaurant in Washington, D.C., says of the cocktail.“You can drink it during one of the surprise fall heat waves as easily as on a chilly evening.” The Chai Spice Mule belongs to the family of drinks that stem from the Moscow Mule , a plucky, sweet and refreshing highball made with ginger beer, vodka, and lime. This particular approach increases the depth of the highball by using chai spices, which adds an autumnal richness to it. For ginger beer, Drake uses Fever-Tree, a popular brand of mixers among bartenders. The sodas have a pleasant balance of sweetness and spice that makes them eminently suitable for using in a Mule. But she also adds a ginger shrub (a type of drinking vinegar), which enhances the drink’s brightness and kick, balancing the chai spices’ darker notes. Traditionally, Mules are served in a copper mug, but Drake opts for a Julep cup instead. Either form of metal cup works, really, and if you don’t have one, the drink is going to taste perfectly good in a highball or rocks glass. 3 Ginger Beer Cocktails to Spice Things Up RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Murlarkey Divine Clarity vodka'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'chai spice syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ginger shrub'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Fever-Tree ginger beer'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'freshly grated nutmeg', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the vodka, chai spice syrup, ginger shrub and lemon juice to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a Julep cup or copper mug over crushed ice, then top with ginger beer.', 'Top with more crushed ice.', 'Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg.']",15,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cabana-boy/,Cabana Boy,Liquor.com,"When drinking spirits or wine, a simple rule applies: The higher the alcohol content, the bigger the body and the richer and fuller the flavor. The same guideline also applies to cocktails, but too much full-flavored booze can take your drink out of balance. So, if you want to increase the weight and mouthfeel of a cocktail without steering its desired character off course, enlist vodka. The neutral-leaning spirit can boost the oomph in drinks without significantly altering the flavor. See this principle in action with the Cabana Boy, an original cocktail by Will Piquette, the principal bartender at Alcove in Boston. He uses vodka as the dominant spirit to avoid overwhelming the palate, but the cocktail is moderated and given dimension by a quartet of other ingredients. Oloroso sherry adds nutty depth, homemade coconut-lemongrass syrup adds creamy, tropical sweetness, and fresh orange juice lends acidity and balance. In cocktails like the Caipirinha , rhum agricole brings a potent punch of funky, grassy flavor, but in the Cabana Boy, the rhum is used more sparingly, with its grassy notes complementing the aromatic lemongrass. The constituent parts come together deftly, producing a complex and tasty drink. But that doesn’t happen without vodka there to support the main players. “Vodka is something that can broaden the flavors that are already present in the cocktail while adding that kick that drinkers are looking for,” says Piquette.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/palomita/,Palomita,Liquor.com,"Paloma means “dove” in Spanish, which then means this drink’s name translates to “little dove.” This Paloma interpretation from April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman’s now-shuttered modern taco restaurant and bar Salvation Taco swaps in vodka for tequila and adds a rim of vanilla-flecked salt but otherwise leaves the original intact. Despite the rather dramatic swap of tequila for vodka, the Palomita might actually please Paloma purists more than other takes on the drink for one simple reason: the use of grapefruit soda. While Paloma recipes these days often involve fresh squeezed grapefruit juice (and maybe some club soda for carbonation), the original recipe—and the way you’ll find it the majority of the time if you order one in Mexico—calls for grapefruit soda. It doesn’t need to be fancy, either. The Palomita uses Jarritos, which is a popular option, but even a brand like Squirt can absolutely work. While vodka producers these days aren’t as obsessed with their products being flavorless as they were in the 1990s and 2000s, most versions of the neutral spirit are still considerably less flavorful than tequila. In order to keep the drink layered and interesting, the Palomita gets a rim of vanilla-flecked salt. You can, of course, buy it, but it might be easier to make your own. A simple way is to cut open a vanilla bean pod and scrape the insides out into a small bowl of salt, mixing it to incorporate. Or you can cut a pod up and leave it infusing in salt for a few days or longer. The latter will result in a more subtle vanilla flavor.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'vodka'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Jarritos grapefruit soda'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'vanilla-flecked salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lemon twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rim a Collins glass with vanilla-flecked salt.', 'Add the vodka and lime juice to a shaker with ice and shake.', 'Strain into the prepared glass over fresh ice.', 'Top with the soda.', 'Garnish with a lemon twist.']",14,vodka
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/night-flights/,Night Flights,Liquor.com,"When it comes to adding ingredients to cocktails to bolster their flavor profile, it usually comes down to something like adding bitters or, in recent times, saline solution or salt. They have their merits, but one ingredient that some bartenders have started to use may come as a surprise: vodka. This neutral spirit can add weight and improve the mouthfeel of a drink without overly altering its flavors. “Use vodka to boost the flavors in cocktails where you have already perfected them,” says Andra Johnson, a Washington, D.C. bartender. “Look at it as more of a catalyst of flavor, not an addition of flavor.” Her drink, the Night Flights, uses vodka to enhance the botanicals of gin, bitters and two liqueurs. Johnson, who co-founded the DMV Black Restaurant Week , created the Night Flights as a love child of James Bond’s famed Vesper cocktail and the classic but divisive Aviation . The Vesper already exists as an exemplar of the technique, adding a touch of vodka to a Martini base to enhance its viscosity. However, rather than the usual aperitif Lillet (or Cocchi Americano), Johnson uses Salers gentian aperitif , which brings a touch of spice and rich botanicals to the mix. While the Night Flights’ base is gin (Johnson uses Opihr, a peppery gin with notes of coriander), vodka gives a textural richness that offsets the astringent and lean gin elements. “By using a grain spirit that has more viscosity, it coats the palate, leaving behind a lingering finish instead of a quick, dry one,” she says. Johnson goes with Civic Vodka from Republic Restoratives , a woman-owned distillery in Washington D.C. This corn-based vodka can be hard to find if you don’t live in the US capital, so feel free to use another vodka as long as it’s smooth and silky. For the Aviation elements, the drink calls for creme de violette; besides the floral aromatics and gentle sweetness, the liqueur also gives the drink a striking violet hue. But rather than adding lemon juice, as with a traditional Aviation, Johnson adds two dashes of lemon bitters, keeping it as a silky stirred concoction rather than a shaken one.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/vodka-gimlet/,Vodka Gimlet,Dylan Garret,"The Vodka Gimlet is one of the purest expressions of a lime-forward sour cocktail. Unlike it's gin-based counterpart , whose profile is heavily dependent on a periodic table of botanicals from the spirit, the Vodka Gimlet leans into clean, simple flavors. The original Gimlet dates to the 19th century, when lime rations were mandated for British sailors in an effort to combat scurvy. To preserve the juice, it was often mixed with neutral spirits, until a a ship provisioner named Lachlan Rose patented a technique that involved fortifying the juice with sugar rather than alcohol, allowing for a shelf stable product—Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. For the better part of the 20th century, the classic Gimlet was a simple mix of gin and Rose's lime cordial. But two key factors changed this makeup. The vodka boom of the 1970s and '80s saw the more neutral spirit gain favor as a common substitute in formerly gin-based cocktails. And as the craft era of cocktails gained steam around the turn of the millennium, drinks that called for pre-made cordials like Rose's were often broken back into their original component parts, like fresh lime juice and sugar. Gimlet RELATED ARTICLE Why the Vodka Gimlet Works The gimlet template is simple, and one of the most basic representations of the sour template of cocktails: a base spirit, with smaller portions of lime juice and sugar (the latter usually in the form of simple syrup). Gin will always be the spirit of choice for a classic Gimlet, but that doesn't leave the Vodka Gimlet without its own unique charms. Gin-based gimlets can be finicky, and the final profile is heavily tied to the botanicals of the gin on hand. Vodka's more neutral flavor profile allows it to act is a blank canvas for the Gimlet template, which allows for a more back-to-basics cocktail where lime takes center stage. While the result will be less complex than a gin-based Gimlet, the Vodka Gimlet leans into maximum refreshment through simplicity. It's also more forgiving in construction and proportions can be more easily tweaked to fit the tastes of whomever's mixing it, as balancing the most subtle aspects of gin is less of a factor. Should a Vodka Gimlet Use Fresh Lime Juice or Rose's Lime Cordial? The endless debate is whether or not a Vodka Gimlet—or any Gimlet, really—should use fresh lime juice and sugar, or Rose's Lime Juice Cordial. There are purists on both sides of the argument. Many like to point that in Raymond Chandler’s 1953 noir novel The Long Goodbye , hardboiled detective Philip Marlowe claims, “A real Gimlet is half gin and half Rose’s lime juice and nothing else.” As with all things, it's really a matter of taste. If you prefer your Vodka Gimlet as 50/50 mix of Vodka and Rose's, pour your heart out. However, it's important to remember that Rose's itself began as an effort to create a shelf-stable version of fresh lime juice. If you're not on a ship dealing with the logistics of storing juice through a transatlantic voyage, there's no reason not to create a Gimlet using fresh lime and sugar, to create the flavor profile Lachlan Rose was originally trying to capture.

But they aren’t just for preparing food—they can also be used to produce flavorful cocktail ingredients, including syrups and infusions. The Elder Greene Blues is an original creation from Adam Gamboa of Denver Italian restaurant Il Posto . Along with a couple standard additions, like Grand Marnier and fresh lime juice, the eye-catching drink features cucumber-basil-infused vodka and a basil syrup, both made with a sous vide machine. By cooking the infusion and syrup concurrently in sealed containers in a low-temperature water bath, Gamboa is able to extract more flavor out of each ingredient than he could by infusing them at room temperature. Cucumber, basil and Fresno peppers imbue the vodka with a rich vegetal and herbal note, while the basil-infused simple syrup provides the cocktail with bright colors and another rich vein of basil flavor. Together they combine to create one of the freshest, most vibrant cocktails around. Using a sous vide machine to make a cocktail may seem complicated, but the devices are actually quite easy to use—and they take a lot of the guesswork out of cooking by dialing in the exact temperature you want. You’ll feel like a chef mixing this drink. And the best part is that you’re making large batches of infused vodka and basil syrup.

Combining pisco—a grape-distilled spirit native to Peru and Chile—with lime juice, egg white and Angostura bitters, the Pisco Sour is earthy and tart. And since its invention, the drink has become a popular classic in South America, the U.S. and around the world. Travel to Peru, and you will find the cocktail served in nearly every bar, restaurant and home. But one of the most famous and sought-after versions belongs to the English Bar at Country Club Lima Hotel .

Bar manager Luiggy Arteaga finds that this amount offers the perfect balance between the other ingredients. The other ingredients include one ounce each of fresh lime juice and simple syrup, plus a modest quarter-ounce of egg white. The drink is shaken vigorously and strained into a rocks glass, presenting a frothy head upon which Arteaga garnishes the cocktail with a single drop of Angostura bitters for color and aroma.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/hipster/,Hipster Shandy,Céline Bossart,"Originating from the patio spritz cart at Hazel in Washington, D.C., the Hipster is part Spritz , part Shandy and part...well, logic-defying. It’s a curious hodgepodge of ingredients, to say the least, layering an Italian aperitivo, orangecello, soda, orange bitters, salt, and a few ounces of IPA on ice in a hurricane glass—an unexpected marriage of ingredients at first glance, but one that works in ways not dissimilar to fusion in the culinary world. The Hipster works because it bridges a gap between two beloved cocktail styles, all the while skirting the technical criteria of both classic builds. Spritzes generally involve three classic ingredients: an aperitivo or amaro , sparkling wine and a splash of club soda. The term “Shandy” is typically used to describe a combination of beer and some form of a citrusy drink, such as lemon-lime soda (or “lemonade,” if you’re in Europe, South Africa, New Zealand or Australia). Back in 2018, Hazel’s then-spirits manager Nick Farrell transformed his go-to drink order—an ice-filled pint glass with a shot of aperitivo and a canned beer poured on top—into this bright and complex cocktail that’s one ingredient short of being a Spritz, essentially swapping beer in place of sparkling wine, which pairs up with the rest of the ingredients (a citrusy soda) placing its other foot in Shandy territory. The pinch of salt is key here, softening any hard, acidic notes and highlighting all the things our palate loves about citrus fruits. Call it what you will, but after you’ve taken your first sip, the Hipster might just become your new favorite cocktail of the summer.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/make-it-count/,Make It Count,Liquor.com,"Bartender and beverage consultant Pamela Wiznitzer says that if you have just one drink, you might as well Make It Count. This lovely red-hued cocktail takes inspiration from the simple-but-pleasing concoction that is Campari and orange juice. Wiznitzer is not the only person to put a creative spin on Campari and orange—New York City bar Dante , for instance, is famous for its Garibaldi , for which bartenders “fluff” the orange juice with a handheld mixer until it’s foamy and frothy. However, Wiznitzer goes a step further with her take on the drink, using a blood orange concentrate from The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley , as well as honey syrup and club soda. The blood orange concentrate brings an intense, orange-packed flavor to the drink, reduces the overall volume and, along with the honey syrup, mellows the bitterness of the Campari. However, the Make It Count would be overly rich and intense without dilution, so Wiznitzer includes an ounce of club soda, adding effervescence and brightening the drink without watering it down. The end result is a refreshing highball that you can enjoy on a hot afternoon or as an after-dinner treat. While the Make It Count is easy to throw together, with only a few ingredients stirred over ice, there is the aspect of the blood orange concentrate to contend with. Wiznitzer’s choice is specific, a brand from the Napa Valley that produces a variety of fruit juice concentrates. Unfortunately, this means there are few, if any, clear substitutions. If the Perfect Puree brand is unavailable, try searching online markets for similar products. And if you’re committed to making the drink and still can’t find any blood orange concentrate online, you could try making your own through boiling or freezing juice. You can always use leftovers in other drinks, playing with substitutions, or mix it with club soda for a juicy and refreshing non-alcoholic fruit soda.","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'club soda'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'blood orange'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'dehydrated orange wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the Campari, club soda, blood orange concentrate and honey syrup to a highball glass with ice and stir gently to combine.', 'Garnish with a dehydrated orange wheel.']",0,

But don’t let your meals have all the fun. You can also infuse fall into your cocktails by using seasonal ingredients like apples and cinnamon. That’s what you will find in Fall from the Tree, an original recipe from bartender Jim Kearns that he created while working at The Happiest Hour in New York City. “It’s an autumnal mix of baking spice, apple and brown spirits,” says Kearns. “It’s served the way we make all of our signature cocktails at The Happiest Hour, by combining the secondary ingredients first and then allowing guests to pick their base spirit.” Kearns like to use applejack for an extra dose of apple, but you can also try bourbon or scotch for good results. Your chosen spirit is then mixed with fresh apple juice, fresh lemon juice, cinnamon syrup and aromatic bitters. If you have a juicer at home, you can extract that apple juice yourself. Otherwise, try to procure some good juice from a green grocer, market or juice bar. It’s worth the effort, as fresh apple juice will add that seasonal sweetness you want alongside the tart lemon and kicky cinnamon. Make the drink with the portions below, if you’re only serving a party of one. But if you are serving a crowd, you can easily scale up the recipe as needed to accommodate your guests, or even make a couple versions featuring different spirits.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/champagne-passion/,Champagne Passion,Liquor.com,"Sweetening Champagne or bolstering it with spirits is a common practice in bartending , as evinced by popular drinks like the Champagne Cocktail , Kir Royale and French 75 . Classy, easy to make and fun to drink with their bubbles and richness, Champagne drinks are generally a big hit with drinkers. Bartending veteran, cocktail historian and award-winning bartending author Brian Van Flandern puts a tropical touch on the venerable tradition by adding passion fruit and a touch of sugar for a bright and fruity concoction, the Champagne Passion. Van Flandern gets passion fruit into his Champagne drink two ways, and the first is with a passion fruit puree. This can be made at home by pulping, seeding, blending and straining, but it’s much easier to simply pick up a passion fruit puree from your nearby grocer or through an online market. They’re rarely overly sweet, usually tending towards sweet-tart, instead. The other passion fruit element to the drink is Alizé, a liqueur rarely seen on craft cocktail menus. Made with a blend of passion fruit, vodka and a variety of other fruits, it’s sometimes used to add fruitiness to drinks like Margaritas and Daiquiris . With the Champagne Passion, it’s important to use one of the flagship products, like the Gold Passion or Red Passion. Blue tastes similar, but will clash into an ugly green when combined with passion fruit puree. The Alizé in the Champagne Passion is floated on top, rather than mixed into the bubbles and other ingredients. Though the Champagne Passion is unconventional compared to most modern cocktails with the use of Alizé and passion fruit puree, it comes from a serious bartender.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/improved-dunlop/,Improved Dunlop,Liquor.com,"Port has a reputation as an after-dinner drink, but this fortified wine from Portugal is a versatile ingredient that can be incorporated into a variety of cocktails. Its versatility is helped by the fact that port is available in multiple styles, which means it can play multiple roles in cocktails—it can add sweetness, replace vermouth, lay down complexity and temper the alcohol content of high-proof drinks. “Port mixes well with a wide range of ingredients, from fresh fruit and berries, herbs and spices to vegetable juices and teas,” says Lulu Martinez, the director of events for Liquid Productions in Aston, Pennsylvania. And its relatively low alcohol level let it play off other flavors and ingredients without dominating drinks. “If you want to take a classic cocktail to the next level, substitute port in place of vermouth as your spirit modifier,” suggests Martinez. That’s what she does with her Improved Dunlop, a rum-laced Reverse Manhattan riff that combines two parts tawny port with one part rhum agricole , plus sugar and Xocolatl Mole bitters. The bitters provide a dash of cacao, cinnamon and spice, and the grapefruit peel garnish brings a little citrus zest to the forefront of each sip. The Improved Dunlop is a great introduction to port-focused cocktails, proving that port is more than an old-school postprandial sipper.

But when creating the Hello, Sun cocktail, Laurin chose to make her own aloe liqueur by reducing aloe water and then mixing it with rhum agricole and honey. She says it’s economical, easy to work with and healthy. The Hello, Sun pairs that DIY aloe liqueur with mezcal, fresh lime juice, cucumbers and mint, so it’s exceedingly refreshing and exactly what you need to cool down on a hot day.

This gin-and-port concoction was the second cocktail that Macy—who now serves as beverage director and partner of the beloved Brooklyn institution after starting as a barback in 2009—contributed to the menu, and years later, it’s still in rotation. This comes at no surprise, given the drink’s appeal. The Port of Call is everything you want from a Thanksgiving feast, striking the perfect balance of sweet, tart, and warm baking spices that’s too good to file away throughout the remainder of the year. Despite the Port of Call recipe’s autumnal appeal, almost all of its ingredients are generally easy to find the other 11 months of the year. When it comes to the cranberry preserves, however, you might have a bit of a trouble outside of the Thanksgiving season. But you can always make your own, or you can order Macy’s in-a-pinch favorite: a jar of cranberry relish from New York staple Sarabeth’s.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/clarita/,Clarita,Alia Akkam,"While for many years, rum was seen as an ingredient mostly useful for crafting Tiki drinks or Caribbean cocktails, the last decade or so has seen a meteoric rise in the use of the sugar cane-based spirit in drinks everywhere. One such inclusion is in the Clarita, from Belgian bartender Ran Van Ongevalle. The founder of Pharmacy, a cocktail lounge in the seaside community of Knokke in Belgium, Van Ongevalle’s Clarita was the winning drink at the 2017 Bacardí Legacy Global Cocktail Competition . The cocktail is a stirred beauty that pairs Bacardí Gran Reserva Maestro de Ron eight-year-old rum with amontillado sherry, crème de cacao, sherry and saline solution. Of course, as part of the Bacardi competition, he and the other competitors were required to use Bacardi rum as the base of their cocktail. Van Ongevalle selected the oldest expression, the 8-year old aged rum, a rich and indulgent rum mostly recognized for its quality as a sipping rum rather than its use in cocktails. It brings a decided elegance and assertiveness to the Clarita, but those making the Clarita at home—rather than for an international cocktail competition—could consider a substitution, including younger Bacardi rums. As for the crème de cacao, which adds silky sweetness to the drink, Van Ongevalle says, “I’m from Belgium, I had to use chocolate.” Sherry, which is seeing more and more use in drinks, pairs beautifully with rum, adding some salinity, nuttiness and depth while giving the drink even more body without raising the alcohol content much. And as far as salinity goes, Van Ongevalle also uses a bit of saline solution, which is as easy to make as a simple syrup is , just using salt instead of sugar and adjusting the proportions to around 1/4 ounce of salt per ounce of water. This bit of salt acts very much like it does in sweeter dishes, enhancing flavors without being noticeably “salty.” Similarly, the two dashes of absinthe, while assertive, is more about adding additional subtle notes than overtly changing the flavor profile, as are the few drops of olive oil that glisten on the surface of the drink. “The most important thing about our drinks is having perfect balance and flavor,” says Van Ongevalle. “If we go too experimental, it won’t work. We want surprising elements, and we also want people to just feel satisfied.” This Is How Chocolate and a Family Business Won This Bartender a Fancy Cocktail Competition FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'rum'}, {'quantity': '1/3', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'amontillado sherry'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'barspoon', 'ingredient': 'crème de cacao'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'absinthe'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'dash', 'ingredient': 'saline solution'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Olive oil', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add all ingredients into a mixing glass with ice and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a chilled coupe.', 'Garnish with 3 drops of olive oil.']",0,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/old-cuban/,Old Cuban,Liquor.com,"Audrey Saunders is a New York bartending legend, best known for her work at Soho’s Pegu Club, where she mentored a roster that includes some of today’s most talented barkeeps. In addition to her penchant for attracting and fostering top talent, she’s also credited with creating several enduring cocktails, many of which are still served at bars around the world. A few of those drinks, including the Gin Gin Mule and the Old Cuban, predate Pegu Club. The Old Cuban was created by Saunders in 2001, while she was working at a midtown restaurant called Beacon and the cocktail renaissance was just beginning. The cocktail takes inspiration from the Mojito, but it features a few important tweaks that result in a unique flavor experience. For starters, Saunders employs aged rum, rather than the Mojito’s traditional call for white rum. From there, simple syrup, fresh lime juice and mint continue the Mojito trajectory, but those ingredients benefit from aromatic bitters and a topper of champagne, which brings a festive dose of effervescence. Throughout her career, Saunders showed a knack for reinventing classics and proved that tweaking tried-and-true templates can be as effective—and potentially more delicious—than even the most creative concoctions. That’s evident in the Old Cuban. It pairs the familiar notes of a Mojito with the bubbly zing of a French 75 . But it holds its own as an original creation and is now part of the modern bartender’s repertoire, a go-to option for rum drinks, Mojito takes and celebrations.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/americano/#gs.DTJWb0M,Americano,Kevin Gray,"James Bond’s impact on drinking culture cannot be overstated, from his Martinis (shaken, not stirred) to the Vesper . But the Americano is Bond’s first drink order in “Casino Royale,” the 1953 book by Ian Fleming that kicked off the series, and the cocktail again makes an appearance in later novels. The man was onto something, but the cocktail predates Bond by nearly a century. The Americano was first served in the 1860s at Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan, Italy. The drink, which features Campari and sweet vermouth in equal parts topped with sparkling water, is an effortless take on the Milano-Torino, which contained Campari and sweet vermouth, sans water. It’s believed that the name stems from its popularity among American tourists. And it’s possible that the name wasn’t affixed until the Prohibition era, when Americans absconded to Europe in droves, thirsty for good drinks. The Americano is also thought to be the precursor to the Negroni . As the story goes, the Negroni was invented in Florence by the Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century, when he asked a barkeep to tweak his Americano by replacing the soda water with gin. Since the cocktail has only three ingredients, it’s important that each component be of the highest quality. Campari takes care of itself. The Italian aperitif is made from a proprietary infusion of herbs and fruit in alcohol, and it gives everything it touches a red-tinged punch of bitterness. You can choose your favorite sweet vermouth, but it’s imperative that the vermouth is fresh: It should be stored in the fridge, and it will begin to change flavor within a month of opening the bottle. All that’s left now is the water. A good soda water or sparkling mineral water with plenty of bite will cut through the bitter Campari and rich vermouth, rendering the drink refreshing and thirst-quenching. With its low-alcohol nature and easy-drinking sensibilities, the Americano is a prime candidate for daytime and preprandial activities. It’s light—but flavorful—and with its bittersweet, bubbly taste, it’s easy to see why counts and spies alike were fans of the classic drink.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/negroni/#gs.x4pbG=0,Negroni,Liquor.com,"Easy to make and refreshingly bitter, the Negroni is said to have been invented in Florence by the dauntless Italian Count Camillo Negroni in the early 20th century. While at Bar Casoni in Florence, he demanded that the bartender strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano , by replacing the usual soda water with gin. To further differentiate the drink, the bartender also employed an orange peel rather than the typical lemon peel. It’s a widely accepted tale, and one that is documented in “Sulle Tracce del Conte: La Vera Storia del Cocktail Negroni,” which was written by Lucca Picchi, the head bartender at Caffe Rivoire in Florence, Italy, and translates to “In the Footsteps of the Count: The True Story of the Negroni Cocktail.” The count’s fateful substitution resulted in one of the most popular stirred drinks in history, as the Negroni sits next to the Martini and Manhattan in the pantheon of classics. It also launched a thousand riffs, and today the Negroni can be found in myriad iterations at restaurants and cocktail bars around the world. Liquor.com / Tim Nusog Few cocktails have encouraged more frenzied experimentation than the beloved Negroni during the course of its 100-year history. Its one-to-one-to-one recipe of gin, Campari and sweet vermouth has become the platform on which generations of drink mixers have left their thumbprint. Sub bourbon for gin, and you’ve got the Boulevardier , a great cocktail in its own right. Try rum or mezcal in the same equal parts configuration with Campari and sweet vermouth, and you get far different yet equally balanced and impressive drinks . There are more ways to tweak the Negroni than by simply swapping its base spirit. The type of vermouth used can have an impact on the outcome too. Pick one that is more bitter, herbal, floral or dry, and you’ll notice the difference. But Campari? That almost always stays put. You can try experimenting with a different bitter liqueur, and some bartenders do. But Campari is the one ingredient that nearly all Negronis have in common. So, how do you mix the perfect classic version? Start by selecting the right base materials. The key to a great Negroni is finding a gin-vermouth pairing that complements, rather than overpowers, the bitter, bold flavors of Campari. Once you zero in on a winning trio, write it down, memorize it, and request it at your favorite bar. You’ll gain the barkeep’s respect, make the count proud and, most important, enjoy a good drink.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Campari'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'sweet vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the gin, Campari and sweet vermouth to a mixing glass filled with ice, and stir until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",1592,gin

Combining pisco—a grape-distilled spirit native to Peru and Chile—with lime juice, egg white and Angostura bitters, the Pisco Sour is earthy and tart. And since its invention, the drink has become a popular classic in South America, the U.S. and around the world. Travel to Peru, and you will find the cocktail served in nearly every bar, restaurant and home. But one of the most famous and sought-after versions belongs to the English Bar at Country Club Lima Hotel . The English Bar Pisco Sour recipe features a hefty four-ounce pour of pisco quebranta, a style made from the predominant pisco grape in Peru. Bar manager Luiggy Arteaga finds that this amount offers the perfect balance between the other ingredients. The other ingredients include one ounce each of fresh lime juice and simple syrup, plus a modest quarter-ounce of egg white. The drink is shaken vigorously and strained into a rocks glass, presenting a frothy head upon which Arteaga garnishes the cocktail with a single drop of Angostura bitters for color and aroma. The English Bar Pisco Sour is strong, dry and tart. You don’t have to add four ounces of booze when you make it (many Pisco Sour recipes call for two ounces), but this version is famous for a reason.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/fresh-strawberry/,Fresh Strawberry,Liquor.com,"While Japan’s older style of mixology leans toward classic pre-Prohibition-era drinks, a new breed of drink professionals is breaking from tradition and using their country’s premium produce to forge the next chapter in Japanese bartending . “The current mainstream of Japanese cocktail making is to combine the spirits with fresh ingredients, rather than using liqueur or flavored syrup,” says barman Naofumi Yokoyama of Bar Entrust, the Third Place in Tokyo’s Ginza neighborhood. He offers a concise collection of cocktails built from pristine seasonal fruit, including kumquat, tomato, cucumber, apple, goji berry, kiwi and, in the appropriately named Fresh Strawberry, strawberries. “The method of cocktail making in Japan has changed from just introducing the cocktail culture from overseas and adding a twist to a standard cocktail to making cocktails combining fresh ingredients such as fruit, vegetables, herbs and spices with spirits,” he says. The Fresh Strawberry, and Bar Entrust’s general concept, is rare in that it doesn’t prescribe a base spirit, instead offering the customer (or bartender, in this case) the choice between gin, vodka, rum or tequila. The sheer distinctions between each spirit is a testament to the drink’s versatility; really, it’s all about the fresh berries, and however you most want to highlight them. Something like gin is going to make a much more floral, light and botanical kind of drink, whereas rum and tequila both bring it into the tropical world. Vodka, and its relatively neutral flavor profile , takes a backseat more than anything, presenting the flavors of the fruit upfront. Like any drink using seasonal ingredients, the Fresh Strawberry really benefits from being made in the warmer months when strawberries are at their freshest, and you don’t need to rely solely on imports. Still, even with the highest quality of fruit, it can use some enhancements in order to really amplify the strawberry flavors; in this case, it’s with a strawberry liqueur and some cranberry juice. There aren’t too many on the market, and your best bet for quality is to go with Drillaud . This French company make a host of flavored liqueur, strawberry being one of them.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/gin-and-tonic/#gs.vWijTR8,Gin & Tonic,Liquor.com,"Gin & Tonic. If you can say it, you can make it. Right? Right. But also, not exactly. The two-ingredient cocktail requires your undivided attention. From glassware to garnish to style of gin and spirit proof, everything should be carefully considered when mixing a G&T. A Gin & Tonic made with a potent base—45% ABV and above, if you mean business—and configured with two parts tonic to one part gin is a highball of balance and beauty. Too much gin, and the botanical spirit will overshadow the unique qualities of the tonic. Too much tonic, and it will drown the gin. There is endless room for experimentation within those two ingredients. With hundreds of gins on the market and dozens of tonics, a good G&T is a mix-and-match exercise to find the combination that best suits your tastes. London dry gins are characterized by their juniper-forward flavor profile; modern-style gins often dial down the juniper and ramp up the citrus and florals. Some tonics are dry and straightforward, with prominent notes of bitter quinine. Others are sweet and syrupy. And in between, you’ll find tonics featuring everything from citrus and aromatics to herbs and spice. Then, of course, there’s the garnish. Many people swear by a lime. Others choose a lemon, and still others prefer a grapefruit slice or rosemary sprig, or a seasonal garnish such as blood orange and thyme. All those permutations results in a bevy of Gin & Tonics, so naturally, the drink lends itself to creativity. Muddled cucumbers or fruit provide an extra dose of refreshment, and a measure of dry vermouth softens the cocktail. Liqueurs, fresh herbs and even barrel-aged gin are all fair game when you’re making G&Ts. It’s an impressive résumé for a drink that traces its roots to quinine powder, which was used in the 1840s as an antimalarial for British soldiers and citizens in India. Originally, the bitter quinine powder was mixed with soda and sugar to make it more palatable. It wasn’t long before enterprising sorts bottled the elixir for commercial use. And soon after that, tonic made its way into gin. Today, tonic features less quinine than past products, and it has a sweeter taste. But its ability to complement gin is unparalleled among mixers. Put the two together in a glass, and you can taste one of the cocktail canon’s best pairings and raise your glass to the knowledge that Gin & Tonics are, essentially, medicine. 7 Gin & Tonic Twists to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE Liquor.com / Tim Nusog","[{'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'gin'}, {'quantity': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'tonic water'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheels or other seasonal garnishes you may prefer', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Fill a highball glass with ice, then add the gin.', 'Top with the tonic water and gently stir.', 'Garnish with lime wheels or seasonal garnishes']",373,gin

A combination of whiskey, sweet vermouth, bitters, and a maraschino cherry garnish , this drink embodies the classic, spirit-forward, and aromatic school of cocktails. Thought to have been first created around the 1880s, the Manhattan’s exact origins are a bit of a mystery. Many credible records place its creation at New York City’s Manhattan Club. One telling is that the drink originated with a guest of the club, Dr. Iain Marshall; others more dubiously claim that it was first mixed for Lady Randolph Churchill, the mother of Winston Churchill, who records show was not even in the United States at the time. Another story ties the Manhattan’s creation to a bartender named Black, who kept an establishment on Broadway south of Houston Street, though it’s hard to find corroboration on this theory as well. Despite the inconsistency of the Manhattan’s origin stories, the cocktail recipe itself has remained largely unchanged through most of its history. Though some early outliers exist—notably one written in 1915 by Henry Watterson in History of the Manhattan Club: A Narrative of the Activities of Half a Century in which the cocktail is made with equal parts—a 2-to-1 ratio of whiskey to vermouth has long been standard. The Manhattan is one of the most iconic and enduring examples of the spirit-forward 2:1 cocktail. Unlike the Martini, which has seen its accepted proportions in constant flux since its inception, the Manhattan’s accepted specifications have largely resisted tweaks and popular whims. Why the Manhattan Works The Manhattan’s template is rather simple and shared by countless cocktails, from the Old Fashioned to the Negroni —a base spirit combined with a sweet element and a bittering agent. Sugar acts to soften the spirit, reduce the heat of the alcohol, and create mouthfeel while bringing out the whiskey’s subtler aspects. A couple dashes of bitter reintroduce depth and accentuate the base spirit’s notes of oak aging. The Old Fashioned is a great comparison point and the most stripped-down example of this template. In it, whiskey is paired with sugar, in the form of a muddled cube or teaspoon of sugar, with a few dashes of Angostura bitters. The Manhattan is almost identical, but simply replaces that teaspoon of plain sugar with an ounce of sweet vermouth. To further break down the math, sweet vermouth tends to average 150 grams of sugar per 750ml bottle, which breaks down to about 4.5 grams per fluid ounce, or… one teaspoon of sugar. Manhattan vs. Old Fashioned: What’s the Difference? RELATED ARTICLE Essentially, in a Manhattan, you’re taking the structure of the Old Fashioned from a spirit/sugar/bitter standpoint, but adding a bit more complexity with the sweet vermouth’s flavor and aromatic profile. Simply put, there’s a reason the Manhattan has changed little since its creation, and why so many cocktails are modeled on its 2:1 spirit-to-vermouth ratio. It’s been proven time and time again to be an ideal structural balance of each component. Should a Manhattan Use Rye Whiskey or Bourbon? Often a divisive point among cocktail nerds, the use of rye or bourbon should really be a point of personal preference in a Manhattan. Rye is often touted as the traditional choice and said by some to have been the preferred whiskey of New Yorkers around the time of the cocktail’s creation. However, bourbon offers its own allure, and the cocktail has historically been made with both. Rye whiskey will contribute the spirit’s spicier and more peppery notes to the cocktail, while bourbon will typically be a touch sweeter. As the sweet vermouth already adds richness and a rounder flavor profile to the cocktail, drier rye whiskey is often preferred to act as a counterweight. However, the right bourbon can function in the same way, and there’s enough overlap between the two whiskey styles (as well as variation between individual bottlings) for it to simply come down to taste.

But every cocktail at Terra Mare—a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida—contains a freshly pressed juice and not all of those juices are made from fruit. “We wanted to use the natural characteristics of our fruits and vegetables to enhance our cocktails instead of sugars, syrups and other additives,” says general manager Ryan Zemel. One such example is the Jessica Rabbit, a vivid orange tequila drink that looks to the other side of the garden for some of its flavors. The Jessica Rabbit is named for the red-haired femme fatale in the seminal 1988 animated film, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit.” In this Margarita riff, carrot juice replaces some of the sweetness normally brought by orange liqueur and simple syrup. The vivid orange of the juice mimics the ginger hue of the namesake character’s signature mane; plus, it’s the vegetable most closely associated with cartoon bunnies like her beau Roger Rabbit. Making carrot juice at home, especially without a juicer, can be taxing, but there are plenty of decent bottled versions at grocery stores. Though not a common ingredient in cocktails, there are other drinks that call for it, including the Bunny Mary and the Lunar Eclipse . Besides the requisite carrot juice, the Jessica Rabbit receives additional botanicals from cilantro simple syrup and jalapeño slices. An ounce of freshly squeezed orange juice balances the drink by tempering some of its heat and adding more sweetness while enhancing the bright orange look. The carrot and orange juice replace some, but not all, of the orange liqueur and lime juice that normally goes in a Margarita. Like with any good Margarita variation, the cocktail is finished with a salted rim and a lime wheel. 4 Vegetable-Heavy Cocktails You Can Make at Home FEATURED IN","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'silver tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Cointreau'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'carrot juice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cilantro simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'slices', 'ingredient': 'jalapeno pepper'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'salt rim', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Rub a lime wedge on the outside of a Collins glass, coat with kosher salt, and set aside.', 'Add the tequila, Cointreau, carrot juice, orange juice, cilantro simple syrup, lime juice and jalapeno slices into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into the prepared Collins glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with a lime wheel.']",0,tequila
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/81-old-fashioned/,81 Old Fashioned,Liquor.com,"The Old Fashioned is one of the world’s most popular and important cocktails. The simple combination of whiskey, sugar, water and bitters has been gracing glasses and pleasing drinkers for two centuries. This recipe from New York bar pro Franky Marshall combines Wild Turkey bourbon with demerara syrup , aromatic bitters and two types of orange bitters. Demerara syrup is easy to make by combining demerara sugar and water, and it brings notes of molasses, toffee and coffee to cocktails. It’s especially popular in Tiki drinks, but it works well with bourbon and other dark spirits, imparting more depth than regular simple syrup . Wild Turkey is best known for its 101-proof bourbon, but in 2011 the brand introduced an 81-proof expression that’s aged between six and eight years in highly charred barrels. It’s tamer than its boozier sibling, but still has plenty of flavor to stand up in all your favorite whiskey drinks. Most Old Fashioneds call for aromatic bitters, but Marshall enlists three types of bitters, with each lending its own nuances and complexity. The result is a rich, warming cocktail with a punch of spice and citrus, further accented by a dual threat of citrus peels: one lemon and one orange.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/pine-pepper-crush/,Pine Pepper Crush,Liquor.com,"The New York Sour is one of those cocktails that, if you’re unfamiliar with it, may seem an unlikely combination of ingredients. You don’t see red wine in cocktails often, after all. However, you’ll quickly understand the appeal after your first sip. The drink’s most distinctive feature is that eye-catching red wine float, topping what’s essentially a classic Whiskey Sour of bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup and (optionally) egg white. Over the last century, the drink’s popularity has ebbed and flowed, and each time it resurfaces it often comes with a number of variations, twists and tweaks . This particular twist, the Pine Pepper Crush, comes from bartending professional Jacques Bezuidenhout, and veers quite a bit from the classic version and into the territory of the Tommy’s Margarita (a Margarita that has agave syrup rather than orange liqueur). In the Crush, blanco tequila takes the place of the usual bourbon, lime juice replaces the lemon juice and agave syrup replaces simple syrup. It also gets sweetness and acidity from muddled pineapple and spice from cracked black pepper, both of which pair well with the tequila. Rather than the familiar red wine float used in the New York Sour, the Pine Pepper Crush gets a float of tawny port. That gives it a similar striking visual, but mutes the tartness of the pineapple rather than enhancing it like a traditional, more acidic red wine float would. The end result is bright and juicier than your average New York Sour, but with additional complexity thanks to the pineapple, port and pepper. Wine Plus Whiskey Equals a Great Cocktail.

But sometimes all you need is the love of a team to inspire a creative libation, like the War Streets Spritz from bartender Michael Anderson. Anderson created this agave spirit drink while working at Butcher and the Rye in in Pittsburgh in homage to the city’s beloved team, the Steelers, and its legendary fullback, Franco Harris. In it, tequila, mezcal and Aperol get boosted with ginger syrup and lemon juice, with a bit of prosecco in honor of Harris’ “Italian army,” the nickname given to the legion of fans that supported him. “The War Streets Spritz is named in honor of Franco Harris’ Italian army and the historic Mexican War Streets neighborhood on Pittsburgh’s North Side,” Anderson says of his drink, describing the neighborhood whose streets are named after notable battles and figures of the Mexican-American War. “Not far from the Steelers’ Heinz Field, War Streets represents an ideal setting for a low-alcohol pregame cocktail before walking down the hill for tailgating.” What Is Mezcal? A Guide to Mexico’s Most Beloved Spirit RELATED ARTICLE Anderson uses Espolón for the reposado tequila in the drink, and Del Maguey Vida for the mezcal. However, another high-quality reposado can be used instead, and another espadin mezcal can stand in for the Vida if need be.

Inspired by this practice, bartender Whitney Neal envisioned a cocktail using the savory-sweet herb blend for a fresh take on the classic Mexican highball the Paloma , normally made with tequila and grapefruit soda. The spice blend often known as za’atar is ubiquitous across Southwest Asia and Northern Africa. It’s commonly a mix of herbs like marjoram or thyme with sumac and toasted sesame seeds—oddly enough, it only sometimes contains its namesake herb za’atar (also known as origanum syriacum or bible hyssop). It also sometimes contains salt, citrus zest and other herbs. There’s no one single way to make the spice blend, and different pre-made mixes will each be distinct. Neal infuses the restaurant’s blend into a simple syrup for a unique cocktail ingredient.

But that génépy is a French liqueur that has been made since 1821. Its recipe includes 30 local herbs and is primarily flavored by mountain sage, giving it a profile similar to a less intense green Chartreuse . Yerba mate is an herbal tea that’s prized in South America for its healthful properties and energy-boosting abilities. Garcia infuses the tea leaves, plus agave syrup and cardamom bitters, into a simple syrup to add bitterness and complexity to the cocktail. Fresh lemon juice brings balance to the equation, while two types of bitters round out the flavors. Orange bitters lend rich citrus notes to the drink, and the Bittercube Corazón bitters bring heat and depth with six types of chile peppers, cocoa and coffee.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/smoky-paloma/,Smoky Paloma,Alex Frane,"While in the United States the Margarita is considered Mexico’s signature cocktail, fans of tequila drinks and regular visitors to Mexico know that the less famous Paloma is as deserving of praise. One such reason is its simplicity: Some recipes call for a mix of tequila, lime juice, grapefruit juice, sweetener and club soda, but more commonly you’ll find it as a simple highball of tequila and grapefruit soda, maybe with a squeeze of lime. There’s really no need to overthink it, unless you’re bartending professional and writer Scott Beattie, author of “Artisanal Cocktails.” His take on the drink, the Smoky Paloma, is anything but simplistic, using not one but three different spirits, plus egg whites and agave nectar. No matter how complex it is compared to the base recipe, the Smoky Paloma still begins with tequila. Here, Beattie uses Tres Agaves blanco, but any good quality blanco tequila will do—feel free to use your favorite, or whatever your have on your home bar. But it’s not the only agave spirit present, as the drink gets its name from the addition of mezcal, specifically Del Maguey Vida, a very popular choice amongst bartenders. It’s only a half-ounce, so the smokiness is present but subtle. The biggest deviation from the classic Paloma is the use of grapefruit vodka. Beattie uses Charbay ruby red grapefruit vodka, but you can use another, or even try your hand at infusing your own grapefruit vodka . In any case, it adds an interesting depth to the drink. The Smoky Paloma still calls for grapefruit juice, as well as lime, and is sweetened with agave nectar rather than simple syrup for even more agave notes. Then, rather than being topped with club soda, the drink is shaken with egg white for a foamy, frothy quality rather than bubbly. It’s a unique take on a classic drink, and while it’s not as easy as cracking open a bottle of grapefruit soda and mixing it with tequila, it’s well worth the effort.

The resulting creation is flavorful, sweet and tart, lending depth and complexity to cocktails. But the beautiful hallmark of shrubs is that there are only two rules when making them: You need a sweet element and an acidic one. Typically, a variety of granulated sugar does the heavy lifting, but other sweeteners can also work. In the Shrubarita, maple syrup and beets offer that perfect one-two hit of character and complexity. This recipe comes from Casey Elsass, the founder of Bushwick Kitchen , a company that produces hot sauces, maple syrups and honey. He combines the maple beet shrub with mezcal and lime juice for a creative riff on the classic Margarita . The drink also receives a salt-and-pepper rim, which brings a savory and spicy note to each sip. Beets may seem like an odd or unnecessary addition to a shrub, but Elsass says they keep the sweetness in check by providing a welcome earthiness. You can make the shrub at home and keep a batch on hand for Shrubaritas and for experimenting with other cocktails. You can also drink it straight.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/cream-of-the-crop/,Cream of the Crop,Liquor.com,"Mezcal is often relegated to Margarita -style drinks, but the smoky agave spirit is as versatile as any liquor. Bartender Brian Means demonstrates this fact with the Cream of the Crop, a frothy, creamy concoction he developed at Dirty Habit in San Francisco. Despite its appearance and mouthfeel, this gingery, nutty drink has no actual cream or dairy in it, instead relying on a coconut and pistachio puree to give it its creamy texture and depth. Creating the puree for the drink is where the bulk of the labor comes in. Since Means was making it for a restaurant setting, it meant he had the tools to prep batches of it ahead of time for large-scale drink production. But the fact that the recipe calls for an ice cream maker to finish the syrup means it may be prohibitive for many home bartenders. You could try substituting it for a pistachio orgeat —it will lead to a different drink, but one that still pairs smoky mezcal with pistachios and ginger. As for the ginger, Means uses King’s ginger liqueur, but something like Domain de Canton could also work, instead. The end result is sweet, smoky and bright with a hint of gingery spice, making it an all-weather kind of drink.

At Fat Baby Tacos, the bar served Vida Palomas on tap to quickly quench patrons’ thirsts. You don’t have to batch up a keg full of cocktails to enjoy it at home.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/alyssum/,Alyssum,Liquor.com,"While some cocktails, like the Mai Tai and Mint Julep , are best enjoyed in the hotter months and other drinks, like the Hot Toddy , are consummate winter sippers, the Alyssum manages to work as an all-season libation. Cognac, cinnamon syrup and vermouth make for a lush and rich cocktail, while grapefruit juice, overproof rum and crushed ice make it refreshing year round. The Alyssum calls for Hennessy V.S.O.P Privilege cognac as its base. The initials stand for Very Superior Old Pale, which assures that the brandy is aged for at least four years, and often this blend has older brandies in the mix as well. While the name Hennessy connotes an extravagant, expensive indulgence, the Privilege is a reasonably priced cognac, usually clocking in under $60. If that’s too high a price to include in a cocktail with grapefruit juice and overproof rum, however, substituting a more affordable V.S.O.P. or even a V.S (aged two years and generally about $20 cheaper) is an acceptable move. Luxardo Bitter Bianco is a bright and bittersweet vermouth that adds floral and botanical notes to the drink, and pairs lovingly with ruby grapefruit juice. Then, rather than a simple syrup, the drink is sweetened with a cinnamon syrup that lends a rich warmth to the final product. One key ingredient in this drink is a float of Lemon Hart & Sons 151 Demerara Rum . This high proof Guyanese rum was something of a legend for a while. A favorite rum of Tiki enthusiasts for its bold, assertive flavors and gentle sweetness, Lemon Hart mostly disappeared from US shelves in the early part of the 2010s, though it did eventually return. Even today it can be tricky to find in some states, but that helps maintain its arcane status. For those who can’t find it, its closest analogue is Hamilton 151 Demerara Rum. Either way, it’s important to serve the Alyssum with a straw so that you or your guests are not getting a mouthful of 151 proof rum with the first sip.","[{'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Handful of mint leaves'}, {'quantity': '2/3', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'cinnamon simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Hennessy V.S.O.P Privilege cognac'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'red grapefruit juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Luxardo Bitter Bianco'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Lemon Hart & Sons 151 demerara rum'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'mint sprig', 'note': 'Garnish'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'grapefruit twist', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Combine the mint leaves and cinnamon simple syrup in the bottom of a Collins glass and gently press the mint to express its oils.', 'Add the cognac, Luxardo Bitter Bianco and grapefruit juice, fill the glass with crushed ice, and swizzle to combine.', 'Top the cocktail with the rum and additional crushed ice to fill the glass.', 'Garnish with a mint sprig and a wide grapefruit twist.']",4,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/space-gin-smash/,Space Gin Smash,Liquor.com,"Gin cocktails are a canvas for experimentation. The dry, juniper-laced spirit pairs well with a variety of ingredients, from vermouth and other fortified wines to citrus, herbs and myriad liqueurs. You can keep your gin drinks classic (think the Dry Martini and Gimlet) or take them in a unique direction, combining a diverse set of flavors, textures and techniques. The Space Gin Smash falls somewhere in between the extremes, utilizing London dry gin, lemon, green grapes, green apple and mint, plus a dash of simple syrup to tie everything together. Consider it an improvement to the usual fruit salad. The Space Gin Space is an original concoction from British bartender and gin aficionado Angus Winchester , who likes to mix this comforting, fruit-filled cocktail on rainy days. He begins by muddling the mint, grapes, apple, lemon and simple syrup in a shaker. This releases the juices and oils from the fruit and herbs, creating a flavorful base for what comes next. And what comes next is adding the gin, shaking it all with ice and pouring yourself a glass of this refreshing treat.

With a little ingenuity, ideally that supplied by an accomplished bartender, you can incorporate grilled ingredients into cocktails. The Eastern Sol proves the point by merging a DIY grilled pineapple puree with mezcal, passionfruit, lime juice, ginger and Angostura bitters. It’s tart and refreshing, providing natural sweetness from the pineapple, rendering simple syrup or other sugars unnecessary. “This drink has layers of fruits that you would typically find stacked with rum, but we decided to go with mezcal instead for a smoky burst that plays with grilled pineapple,” says drinks pro Jefferson Oatts, who created the drink for Monkitail at the Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood, Florida. “Pineapple can go a lot of different ways.” Charring it tames the acidity, and if you use a charcoal grill, it will also impart a smoky note, he adds. That smoky note blends seamlessly with the mezcal, passionfruit and spicy ginger, giving you a savory and unique cocktail perfect for backyard barbecues or any time you want to break out the grill. 20 Tequila and Mezcal Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Del Maguey Vida\xa0mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'grilled pineapple puree'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'passionfruit puree'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'ginger'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Angostura bitters float', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the mezcal, grilled pineapple puree, passionfruit puree, lime juice and grated ginger into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Strain into a hurricane glass over fresh pebble ice.', 'Float Angostura bitters by dashing them on top of the drink.']",0,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/definite-maybe/,Definite Maybe,Liquor.com,"The Creamsicle ice cream bar provides a nostalgic taste of childhood for many. But while the orange and vanilla treat holds up in adulthood, it’s conspicuously absent any alcohol. So, you may want to skip the ice cream in favor of the Definite Maybe, an original cocktail by Daniel Osborne, the beverage director at Portland, Oregon’s Abigail Hall in the Woodlark hotel. He pulled inspiration from the Creamsicle to make this cocktail, which features mezcal, herbal liqueur, orange juice, lemon juice, mint simple syrup and Angostura bitters. Banhez mezcal is made using traditional methods. Agave hearts are cooked in underground wood-fired pits and crushed by donkey-pulled tahonas (large stone wheels) before the juice is fermented in wooden vats and distilled in small batches in copper alembic stills. That effort produces a spirit that is fruity and floral. Dolin génépy is a French liqueur that has been made since 1821. Its recipe includes 30 local herbs and is primarily flavored by mountain sage, giving it a profile akin to less-intense green chartreuse . Osborne joins those floral, fruity and herbal flavors with the citrusy kick of fresh orange and lemon juices, plus some minty intrigue courtesy of homemade mint simple syrup. A couple dashes of aromatic bitters tie it together with a neat bow. This isn’t the same Creamsicle you experienced after chasing down the neighborhood ice cream truck, but it does offer some of those sweet and satisfying orange notes spliced between layers of smoky mezcal, herbal liqueur and mint. Ergo, it’s better. 11 Tequila and Mezcal Cocktails to Try Right Now RELATED ARTICLE","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Dolin genepy'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'orange juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'orange peel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the mezcal, Dolin génépy, orange juice, lemon juice, mint simple syrup and bitters into a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.', 'Garnish with an orange peel.']",8,mezcal

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/autumn-wind/,Autumn Wind,Liquor.com,"Few things go together like football and enjoying a drink with friends. And while it’s most often beer that is associated with football-related revelry, a cocktail can fit just fine, especially when that cocktail is made by a bartender specifically as an homage to an NFL team. That’s the origin of the Autumn Wind, a Caribbean style drink made with rum, tequila, falernum and lime juice, which was made in honor of the Raiders. “With two and a half ounces of liquor, this is the perfect cocktail for an Oakland Raiders fan,” says bartender Martin Delgado. Delgado made the drink while working at Prizefighter in Emeryville, California, well before the Raiders made their move to Las Vegas. “Bold and strong while pleasantly refreshing, that is always my take away from a Raiders tailgate and a Raiders win,” he says. The Autumn Wind is a bit like a variation on a Daiquiri or a Mai Tai , with some tequila thrown in. The Raiders’ pirate theme inspired the base of the Autumn Wind, Delgado explains. “And as we are the Raiders, rum was without question the base spirit. Go, Raiders!” However, the rum is used in an unconventional way. While it makes up half the volume of the drink and provides most of the alcohol, it does not get incorporated with the other ingredients. Rather, the tequila, falernum and lime are shaken together and served over crushed ice, while black strap rum is floated on top. The result is a visually compelling, double-layered drink. Of course, imbibing said cocktail will naturally blend the two sides together, or just give it a stir to incorporate the elements. Delgado uses Cruzan black strap rum, but any other black rum can work. It’s important to use a black rum though, not one like an añejo. Dark and rich with notes of spice and molasses, the rum adds both a depth of flavor and enhances the double-decker look. Falernum is another key element of the Autumn Wind. Similar to orgeat , this syrup is generally flavored with ginger, lime, almond, cloves and allspice. Often referred to as velvet falernum—including by its most popular producer, John D. Taylor’s Velvet Falernum —it can be made as either a low-proof liqueur or a non-alcoholic syrup. Either work here, and the low volume called for means the drink won’t be too much stronger when using the boozy variety.","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Cruzan black strap rum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'silver tequila'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'falernum'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'lime wheel', 'note': 'Garnish'}]","['Add the tequila, falernum and lime juice to a shaker with ice and shake until cold.', 'Strain into a double rocks glass filled with crushed ice.', 'Top with the black strap rum, fill with more crushed ice, and garnish with a lime wheel and a straw or two.']",0,rum
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/alfies-apple/,Alfie’s Apple,Alex Frane,"Mezcal, St-Germain elderflower liqueur, apple cider and apple soda make the Alfie’s Apple an autumnal quaffer, though one that’s a bright, crisp and aromatic pleasure all year long. New York City bartender and bar consultant Tad Carducci crafted the drink with some ingredients that might be a bit difficult to find at local shops: while fresh squeezed apple cider is easy enough to find in any grocery store or bodega, this drink additionally calls for Sidral Mundet , a century-old apple-flavored soda from Mexico. Sidral Mundet can sometimes be found at Mexican markets. And, of course, these days it’s possible to find just about anything online, including Mexican apple sodas. However, if don’t want to pay for the shipping on a cocktail ingredient, you can replace it with something like the popular and widespread Martinelli’s or another sparkling apple cider. It won’t be the exact same thing as using Sidral Mundet, so check your local stores for it first. In addition to the apple flavor, mezcal gives this highball a nice smoky finish. If smoke in your glass isn’t your thing, you can always choose to use a less smoky mezcal, or even swap it out for tequila. St-Germain raises the sweetness level and floral notes of the drink, and while it’s the most well-known and popular brand of elderflower liqueur, there are some alternatives including Drillaud Elderflower Liqueur and St. Elder Elderflower Liqueur . Another area for customization is with the rim. Carducci rims his highball glass with a mix of Chinese five-spice powder and sugar for extra sweetness and spice. However, if you don’t like the flavor of it, or just don’t want to fuss with it, it’s fine to omit. If you do want to include it, the trick is to place a small amount of the powder on a flat plate and rub a wedge of lemon around the rim of the glass, making sure not to spill down the side. Then, gently roll the rim in the powder. The moisture helps the powder cling to the glass, and the result is a clean and evenly dusted rim.","[{'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tsp', 'ingredient': 'chinese 5 spice'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'tsp', 'ingredient': 'sugar'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'mezcal'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'St-Germain'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'fresh apple cider'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lemon juice'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'honey syrup'}, {'quantity': '3', 'unit': 'dashes', 'ingredient': 'bitters'}, {'quantity': '2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'apple soda'}, {'quantity': '1', 'unit': 'medium (3"" dia)', 'ingredient': 'apple'}]","['If desired, combine equal parts five-spice powder and sugar, and use to coat the rim of a tall glass.', 'Fill the glass with ice and set aside.', 'Add the mezcal, St-Germain, lemon juice, honey syrup, apple cider and bitters to a shaker with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into the prepared glass.', 'Top with the Sidral Mundet and stir gently.', 'Garnish with an apple slice.']",0,mezcal
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-fennel-countdown/,Fennel Countdown,Liquor.com,"Created by bartender Alexis Osborne of the now-closed Acorn in Denver, the Fennel Countdown is a warming drink that evokes campfire chats and cold days when you're snuggled under a blanket with a good book. With both rum and calvados as well as a unique clove liqueur, it’s bright and flavorful with a fruity undertone. The fennel proves mild and slightly minty but helps give the cocktail body and a slight clarifying aftertaste. The original recipe for the Fennel Countdown uses a number of specific labels for its ingredients. For instance, Osborne used The Real McCoy 12-year-old rum as well as Père-Magloire V.S.O.P. calvados, a highly regarded apple brandy from France. However, feel free to use another aged rum (try to stick to a 12-year expression) as well as another calvados if desired. The clove liqueur, however, will be much harder to substitute. If you can’t find The DECC citrus clove liqueur from 291 Distillery in Colorado, you’ll want to do some online shopping to get it. Similarly, the Strongwater Wildfire bitters are integral to the recipe, so you’ll want to secure those before setting out to make it. Apricot puree, lemon juice and a fennel syrup made with fennel seeds and sugar are the other ingredients needed. It leads to a deeply complex drink, even if it is a bit labor and ingredient-intensive.

https://www.liquor.com/recipes/the-purple-one/,The Purple One,Alex Frane,"When it comes to cocktail colors, purple tends to be rare. Often, purple drinks are a result of using butterfly pea flour , the color-changing compound found in Empress 1908 gin and Wild Hibiscus b’Lure butterfly pea flower extract. Other times, it a result of using creme de violette, like in the historic Aviation cocktail, though that can easily come out closer to sky blue, as befits its name. However, bartender Thor Slaughter of Eugene, Oregon, developed his own purple cocktail with neither of those ingredients. Instead, The Purple One features a fermented grape soda, but it’s not jammy or overly sweet. “In cocktails I always try to show people a different side of a flavor than they might be familiar with,” Slaughter says.  “Most people hear “purple grape flavor” and prepare for something sickeningly sweet... it was very important to keep the drink lean and maintain that beautiful dark purple hue.” Slaughter created the Purple One while working at Eugene’s Party Bar . The restaurant’s owner developed a fermented grape soda based on a recipe from the now-closed Bar Tartine in San Francisco, and Slaughter used it to add that namesake violet hue. The recipe for the soda is available in the Bar Tartine’s cookbook, “Bar Tartine: Techniques and Recipes.” However, if you’re making The Purple One at home you can feel free to substitute a high quality bottled grape soda like Boylan or Stewart’s. And although it calls for soda, it only takes a bit and is served in a cocktail glass rather than a highball. The base spirit of The Purple One is Vivacity Native gin , made nearby Eugene in Corvallis, Oregon. Slaughter describes it as being beautiful and floral, and different from the more traditional London dry style. If you can’t find it, Slaughter suggests substituting it with another “flowery” gin. The drink also gets Carpano Bianco vermouth. “The Carpano Bianco was the perfect choice to help even out the drink,” Slaughter says. “The vermouth has that nice dry sweetness that is the hallmark of a solid blanc vermouth. It expands the notes of the drink and balances the mouthfeel—the drink feels quite viscous without it.” As for its name, it comes from Minneapolis’ most beloved rock star. As Slaughter says, “Who doesn’t love Prince?”","[{'quantity': '1 1/2', 'unit': 'ounces', 'ingredient': 'Vivacity Native gin'}, {'quantity': '3/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'lime juice, freshly squeezed'}, {'quantity': '1/4', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'simple syrup'}, {'quantity': '1/2', 'unit': 'ounce', 'ingredient': 'Carpano Bianco vermouth'}, {'quantity': '', 'unit': '', 'ingredient': 'Grape soda'}]","['Add the Vivacity Native gin, lime juice, simple syrup and Carpano Bianco vermouth to a shaker filled with ice and shake until well-chilled.', 'Double-strain into a cocktail glass.', 'Top with 3/4 to 1 ounce grape soda.']",0,gin
https://www.liquor.com/recipes/flying-elvis/,Flying Elvis,Liquor.com,"When it comes to football fans, it’s hard to beat the pure zeal of those New Englanders decked out in red, white and navy blue. Patriots fans are a hardcore bunch, and so it takes little convincing for a bartender like Vikram Hegde to put together a cocktail in reverence to the team. Hegde created the Flying Elvis while working at Cambridge, Massachusetts, tapas restaurant Little Donkey . The name comes from the team’s 1990s logo of a Revolutionary War soldier wearing a hat, dubbed “The Flying Elvis.” The drink itself: a potent and complex rum drink not too far removed from a Daiquiri . “This cocktail is a little taste of humble pie, with the strength and resolve of some local navy-strength rum providing structure,” says Hegde. The Flying Elvis begins with Privateer Navy Yard rum —appropriately, it comes out of New England, just up the road from Boston in Ipswich, Massachusetts. At 110 proof, it’s lower than some overproof rums, but still packs quite a wallop; a few Flying Elvises and the next morning you might feel like you were tackled by Andre Tippett. You can always switch it out for another high-proof rum if you can’t get your hands on Privateer’s, or even a lower proof aged rum if desired. In addition to the rum, the cocktail also includes Amaro di Angostura for herbal complexity, lime juice for acidity and Giffard Banane du Brésil liqueur standing in for sweetness. Hegde says its gets “a little taste of the unexpected from the Amaro di Angostura and egg white, just like the Pats playbook.” The egg whites also give the drink a solid foam head on which to float a few dashes of Angostura bitters. If you can, the bitters are best when striped into long strips, like the embellishment of the Flying Elvis logo.
