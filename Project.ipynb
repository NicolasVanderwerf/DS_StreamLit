    "## Step 2: Project\n",
    "\n",
    "You have about 2-3 weeks to build your project in following steps:\n",

    "1. Exploring and making a project idea and plan. \n",

      "Kansas City Ice Water\n",
      "\n",
      " The Kansas City Ice Water, also known as the KC Ice Water, is a simple cocktail that usually includes gin, vodka, lime juice, triple sec, and lemon-lime soda. The drink remains popular in its original form, but that hasn’t stopped some bartenders from seeking to improve upon its base template. This zesty, floral, and crowd-pleasing riff comes from Andrew Olsen, national beverage director of J. Rieger & Co, a historic distillery in Kansas City, Missouri. “The KC Ice Water was a common order in the high-volume bar scene of many college towns and local haunts, especially in the Midwest region,” says Olsen. “In 2017, when opening up a restaurant in the Country Club Plaza district, I recognized that popularity and wanted to make something that was reminiscent of the original flavors, but with a more craft element added to it.” “Our version stays with the vodka base but instead of splitting with gin, we use riesling wine,” he says. “This gives us great minerality and some brilliant fruit flavors like pear and green apple. Then we use a chamomile syrup that is somewhat parallel to the floral/botanical experience you get from the gin.”  For the base, Olsen uses J. Rieger’s Premium Wheat Vodka, which is 100% wheat-based and has a rich texture due to a final distillation in a copper pot still. If you can’t source J. Rieger, look for another wheat-based vodka. Olsen also suggests using a kabinett riesling, which is a semi-dry, high-acid style.  This recipe calls for a homemade chamomile syrup, which comes together easily on the stovetop and can be saved for use in other cocktails or for cooking and baking. You can source dried chamomile flowers on Amazon or at many grocery stores like Whole Foods. The cocktail is balanced with fresh lime juice and a coarse sparkling mineral water like Topo Chico or Jarritos Mineragua.\n",
